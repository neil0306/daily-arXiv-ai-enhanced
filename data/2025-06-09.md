### [1] [EvidenceOutcomes: a Dataset of Clinical Trial Publications with Clinically Meaningful Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05380)
*Yiliang Zhou,Abigail M. Newbury,Gongbo Zhang,Betina Ross Idnay,Hao Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvidenceOutcomes, a high-quality annotated corpus for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from biomedical literature, addressing the neglect of Outcomes in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outcomes in PICO elements are often neglected or oversimplified in existing benchmarks, prompting the need for a robust annotated corpus.

Method: Developed annotation guidelines with clinicians and NLP experts, annotated 500 PubMed abstracts and 140 from EBM-NLP, and fine-tuned PubMedBERT for outcome extraction.

Result: Achieved high inter-rater agreement (0.76) and PubMedBERT F1-scores of 0.69 (entity) and 0.76 (token) on the EBM-NLP subset.

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes serves as a benchmark for developing ML algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from biomedical abstracts.

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

### [2] [LLMs Can Also Do Well! Breaking Barriers in Semantic Role Labeling via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05385)
*Xinxin Li,Huiyao Chen,Chengjun Liu,Jing Li,Meishan Zhang,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces retrieval-augmented generation and self-correction mechanisms to enhance LLMs for SRL, achieving state-of-the-art performance in Chinese and English benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between generative decoder-based LLMs and encoder-decoder models in semantic role labeling (SRL).

Method: Equips LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (leveraging external linguistic knowledge) and self-correction (identifying and fixing inconsistent outputs).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012 benchmarks, surpassing encoder-decoder models in SRL.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms successfully enable LLMs to outperform traditional approaches in SRL, marking a significant advancement.

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

### [3] [Beyond RAG: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Chengshuai Zhao,Yu-Hua Zeng,Yuan Jee Lim,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2AG is a reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation, using reinforcement learning and group-based optimization to improve retrieval and reasoning for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods struggle with generating long-form clinical notes from limited patient data.

Method: Proposes R2AG, trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, and GRO for group-based retriever optimization.

Result: R2AG outperforms baselines in clinical efficacy and NLG metrics, filling semantic gaps and reducing misinterpretation.

Conclusion: R2AG enhances LLM performance in long-form clinical note generation by leveraging retrieved reasoning paths and optimized retrieval.

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

### [4] [Advancing Decoding Strategies: Enhancements in Locally Typical Sampling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05387)
*Jaydip Sen,Saptarshi Sengupta. Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASTS improves LTS for LLMs by balancing fluency, diversity, and coherence with dynamic entropy thresholding and multi-objective scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decoding methods like top-k and nucleus sampling fail to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.

Method: ASTS enhances LTS with dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments.

Result: ASTS outperforms existing methods in benchmarks, reducing repetition and improving semantic alignment and fluency.

Conclusion: ASTS is a computationally efficient solution for coherent and diverse text generation in LLMs.

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

### [5] [taz2024full: Analysing German Newspapers for Gender Bias and Discrimination across Decades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05388)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces taz2024full, the largest open-access German newspaper corpus (1.8M articles, 1980-2024), and demonstrates its use in analyzing gender bias, showing a gradual shift toward balanced coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited large-scale German corpora hinder NLP and CSS research, especially on societal issues like gender bias.

Method: Created taz2024full corpus and used a scalable analysis pipeline to study gender representation over four decades.

Result: Found consistent male overrepresentation but a recent trend toward balanced coverage.

Conclusion: The corpus enables diverse research in German NLP and CSS, promoting inclusive and reproducible studies.

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

### [6] [Understanding Gender Bias in AI-Generated Product Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05390)
*Markelle Kelly,Mohammad Tahaei,Padhraic Smyth,Lauren Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines gender bias in LLMs for e-commerce, focusing on product description generation, and identifies novel forms of bias requiring specialized detection and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore under-examined gender bias in LLMs within e-commerce, particularly in product descriptions, and align findings with existing AI harm taxonomies.

Method: Developed data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias, analyzed GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM for bias occurrences.

Result: Found unique biases like clothing size assumptions, stereotypical feature advertising, and persuasive language differences.

Conclusion: Highlights novel gender bias dimensions in e-commerce, contributing to understanding exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities.

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

### [7] [Are Large Language Models Good Temporal Graph Learners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05393)
*Shenyang Huang,Ali Parviz,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Zifeng Ding,Michael Bronstein,Reihaneh Rabbany,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TGTalker is a new framework for applying LLMs to dynamic graphs, showing competitive link prediction and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The application of LLMs to real-world dynamic graphs is underexplored, unlike synthetic temporal graphs.

Method: TGTalker uses recency bias and temporal neighbors, converting graph info to natural language for LLMs.

Result: TGTalker matches or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal graph models in link prediction across five real-world networks.

Conclusion: TGTalker advances LLM use in dynamic graphs, offering explainable predictions and new research directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

### [8] [Auto Review: Second Stage Error Detection for Highly Accurate Information Extraction from Phone Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05400)
*Ayesha Qamar,Arushi Raghuvanshi,Conal Sathi,Youngseo Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Auto Review automates post-call verification in healthcare, reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy. A second-stage pipeline improves transcript quality by leveraging multiple ASR alternatives and pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual verification of noisy call transcripts is labor-intensive. Automating this process can save time and improve patient care.

Method: A two-stage system with Auto Review and a postprocessing pipeline using multiple ASR alternatives and pseudo-labeling.

Result: Improved accuracy in transcript correction, enhancing Auto Review's efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline significantly reduces manual effort and maintains high accuracy in healthcare benefit verification.

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

### [9] [Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410)
*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AsymKV, a training-free compression framework for KV caches in LLMs, addressing the asymmetry between keys and values to improve long-context modeling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in LLMs limits efficient long-context modeling, and existing KV cache compression methods overlook the asymmetry between keys and values.

Method: Proposes AsymKV, combining homogeneity-based key merging with lossless value compression, leveraging the observed asymmetry in KV caches.

Result: AsymKV outperforms existing methods, achieving an average score of 43.95 on LongBench with LLaMA3.1-8B, surpassing H$_2$O (38.89).

Conclusion: The asymmetry in KV caches is critical for compression; AsymKV provides an effective, training-free solution for long-context modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

Motivation: Address the challenge of activation outliers in 4-bit quantization of LLMs to enhance quantization accuracy.

Method: Integrates channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations to transform outliers into quantization-friendly activations.

Result: Reduces performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by 10-30% on tasks like language generation and zero-shot reasoning, with no added latency.

Conclusion: SmoothRot effectively improves 4-bit quantization in LLMs, maintaining accuracy without compromising speed.

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively

TL;DR: The paper explores predicting amusing Wordle games using Reddit reactions, GPT-3.5 for classification, and feature extraction to identify amusement signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To computationally predict which Wordle games Reddit users find amusing, leveraging user reactions and game features.

Method: Scraped 80k Reddit reactions, classified amusement using GPT-3.5, and extracted predictive features from Wordle games.

Result: Features provided a weak but measurable signal for predicting amusement, showing predictability in user reactions.

Conclusion: User amusement in Wordle games is computationally predictable, revealing a measurable aspect of creativity and humor in the game.

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

### [12] [MLLM-CL: Continual Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05453)
*Hongbo Zhao,Fei Zhu,Rundong Wang,Gaofeng Meng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CL introduces a benchmark for continual learning in multimodal large language models, addressing domain and ability adaptation with parameter isolation and routing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with dynamic real-world scenarios requiring continuous learning, and existing benchmarks/methods for continual learning are limited.

Method: Proposes parameter isolation to prevent catastrophic interference and an MLLM-based routing mechanism for integrating new knowledge.

Result: The approach successfully integrates domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MLLM-CL provides an effective solution for continual learning in MLLMs, addressing key limitations in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

### [13] [Multidimensional Analysis of Specific Language Impairment Using Unsupervised Learning Through PCA and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05498)
*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses unsupervised machine learning to analyze language development in children with and without SLI, identifying two primary clusters and supporting a continuum model of language abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early identification and targeted interventions for SLI by uncovering natural language development trajectories.

Method: Analyzed narrative samples from 1,163 children using PCA and clustering on 64 linguistic features.

Result: Two clusters emerged: high production/low SLI and limited production/high syntactic complexity/high SLI. Findings suggest SLI is linked to reduced production, not syntactic deficits.

Conclusion: The study challenges categorical SLI diagnosis and advocates for unsupervised learning in refining diagnostic and intervention approaches.

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

### [14] [Improving LLMs with a knowledge from databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05560)
*Petr Máša*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using enhanced association rules to improve LLM answers via RAG, showing significant improvement over ChatGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of control and safety in LLM-generated commands while improving answer accuracy using structured data.

Method: Generates rulesets from knowledge patterns, converts rules to text, and integrates them into LLM via RAG.

Result: Significant improvement in dataset-based question answering compared to ChatGPT, even with agents.

Conclusion: The method is promising and offers future enhancements like incorporating more patterns or using rule mining as an agent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

Conclusion: Connecting with local organizations and leveraging cultural insights can effectively combat misinformation in the Arab region.

Abstract: Misinformation and disinformation pose significant risks globally, with the
Arab region facing unique vulnerabilities due to geopolitical instabilities,
linguistic diversity, and cultural nuances. We explore these challenges through
the key facets of combating misinformation: detection, tracking, mitigation and
community-engagement. We shed light on how connecting with grass-roots
fact-checking organizations, understanding cultural norms, promoting social
correction, and creating strong collaborative information networks can create
opportunities for a more resilient information ecosystem in the Arab world.

*Sara Shields-Menard,Zach Reimers,Joshua Gardner,David Perry,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-step system using large language models for clinical question answering from EHRs, focusing on sentence relevance and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of answering clinical questions using EHRs by leveraging large language models.

Method: Uses few-shot prompting, self-consistency, and thresholding for sentence classification, followed by response generation. Compares performance of 8B and 70B models.

Result: The 8B model outperforms the 70B model in identifying relevant information. Accurate sentence selection is key for high-quality responses.

Conclusion: Self-consistency with thresholding enhances reliability in sentence selection, improving overall system performance.

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

Result: 4.4% accuracy improvement on Chatbot Arena; top performance on PersonalRewardBench.

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe effectively enhances personalized reward modeling without needing extra identity data.

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPERA, a dataset for evaluating LLMs' ability to simulate user web actions by capturing personas, observations, actions, and rationales from real users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets for evaluating LLMs' simulation of real user behaviors, especially in web interactions.

Method: Developed OPERA dataset using an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to collect user personas, observations, actions, and rationales.

Result: Established the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' prediction of user actions and rationales.

Conclusion: OPERA enables future research into LLM agents as personalized digital twins for humans.

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

*Zhecheng Sheng,Xiruo Ding,Brian Hur,Changye Li,Trevor Cohen,Serguei Pakhomov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores gender confounding in dementia detection using transformer models, proposing two methods to mitigate bias and evaluating their impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked effects of speaker gender in Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening using pre-trained language models, aiming to reduce bias in dementia detection.

Method: Proposes the Extended Confounding Filter and Dual Filter to isolate and remove gender-related weights in transformer models, evaluated on dementia datasets.

Result: Transformer models overfit to training data; disrupting gender-related weights reduces bias but slightly lowers dementia detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Gender deconfounding improves fairness in dementia detection, though with a minor trade-off in performance.

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

TL;DR: Proposes ID-SPAM, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using input-dependent soft prompts with self-attention, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the computational expense and technical challenges of fine-tuning large language models for domain-specific tasks.

Method: Introduces ID-SPAM, which generates soft prompts based on input tokens and uses self-attention to vary token importance.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and improved zero-shot domain transfer compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ID-SPAM is a simple, efficient solution for fine-tuning with minimal trainable parameters.

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream
tasks by learning a small set of parameters. We propose a novel Input Dependent
Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach
compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved
zero shot domain transfer capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current language models struggle with detecting extremist cryptolects, but domain adaptation and specialized prompting improve performance. Novel datasets are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of language technologies in detecting and interpreting extremist cryptolects, aiding automated moderation.

Method: Evaluated eight models across six tasks, using domain adaptation and specialized prompting techniques.

Result: General-purpose LLMs fail consistently, but performance improves with domain-specific adjustments.

Conclusion: Specialized techniques and datasets are crucial for effective automated moderation of extremist content.

Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as
cryptolects, to exclude or mislead outsiders. We investigate the ability of
current language technologies to detect and interpret the cryptolects of two
online extremist platforms. Evaluating eight models across six tasks, our
results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode
extremist language. However, performance can be significantly improved by
domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide
important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated
moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and
unlabelled datasets, including 19.4M posts from extremist platforms and
lexicons validated by human experts.

*John Kirchenbauer,Janny Mongkolsupawan,Yuxin Wen,Tom Goldstein,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset to study how language models memorize facts versus verbatim sequences, showing its effectiveness in distinguishing these memorization types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how language models memorize facts and verbatim sequences from training data, which is currently less understood.

Method: Proposes a synthetic dataset of fictional events and question-answer pairs, conducting training experiments to analyze memorization.

Result: Demonstrates the dataset's effectiveness in differentiating fact memorization from verbatim memorization.

Conclusion: Synthetic data about fictional events is useful for studying memorization in language models, though creating realistic synthetic data poses challenges.

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CulturalPersonas is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' culturally appropriate personality expression, improving alignment with human norms across diverse countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked interplay between culture and personality in LLMs, aiming for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive models.

Method: Introduces CulturalPersonas, a dataset with 3,000 scenario-based questions across six countries, evaluated using multiple-choice and open-ended formats.

Result: Shows improved alignment with human personality distributions (20% reduction in Wasserstein distance) and more expressive, culturally coherent outputs.

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas bridges personality and culture, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global behavioral norms.

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

*Zefan Zeng,Xingchen Hu,Qing Cheng,Weiping Ding,Wentao Li,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEFA is a zero-shot framework for Event Causality Identification (ECI) using Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation to reduce causal hallucination and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECI models rely on supervised methods needing large annotated data, while LLMs in zero-shot ECI suffer from spurious causal links.

Method: Decomposes causality into tasks, uses prompts for LLM responses, and aggregates evidence via fuzzy logic for scoring.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 6.2% F1-score and 9.3% precision, reducing hallucination errors.

Conclusion: MEFA's task decomposition and fuzzy aggregation effectively improve zero-shot ECI performance.

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate and unify the representational principles of PSG, DG, and CG for better syntactic analysis and computational efficiency.

Method: Introduces the correspondence principle and demonstrates its application using a discontinuous subordinate clause from Turkish.

Result: Achieves a unified representation that simplifies computational complexity and enhances syntactic analysis.

Conclusion: The unified approach integrates PSG, DG, and CG, offering theoretical and computational benefits for natural language processing.

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show GraphRAG underperforms vanilla RAG, prompting the need to assess its real-world effectiveness and ideal use cases.

Method: GraphRAG-Bench includes a dataset with varied difficulty tasks and evaluates the entire GraphRAG pipeline.

Result: The benchmark identifies scenarios where GraphRAG outperforms traditional RAG and explains its success.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench provides guidelines for practical GraphRAG application and shares resources for community use.

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

### [27] [Being Strong Progressively! Enhancing Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models through a Curriculum Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05695)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel curriculum learning framework (POCL) improves knowledge distillation for LLMs by progressively introducing training samples from easy to hard, enhancing stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for LLMs suffer from distribution shifts, leading to issues like catastrophic forgetting and training-inference mismatch.

Method: POCL includes a difficulty measurer to rank samples and a training scheduler to introduce them progressively with rising loss temperatures.

Result: POCL consistently improves student model performance across various KD methods and model families.

Conclusion: Sorted training samples enhance KD stability and performance, demonstrating the value of structured training data in LLM distillation.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

TL;DR: Rel-LLM introduces a GNN-based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs, preserving database structures and outperforming text-based methods in RDL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based serialization of relational data for LLMs ignores critical structures and faces redundancy and context length issues.

Method: Uses a GNN encoder to extract local subgraphs, creating structured relational prompts for LLMs within a RAG framework.

Result: Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on RDL tasks, offering scalable integration of LLMs with structured data.

Conclusion: Rel-LLM effectively bridges the gap between LLMs and relational data, enhancing reasoning over complex relationships.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating knowledge unlearning in LLMs using knowledge graphs and LLM judges to address implicit dependencies and overestimation in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning approaches focus on explicit fact removal, ignoring latent dependencies and non-deterministic knowledge, leading to incomplete unlearning.

Method: Proposes a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework using knowledge graphs and LLM judges with calibrated prompts for accurate assessment.

Result: The framework provides a more realistic evaluation, revealing current methods overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a rigorous and realistic way to assess unlearning, highlighting flaws in existing evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prompting methods for LLMs struggle with temporal tabular QA due to memorization, table size sensitivity, and poor performance on complex queries.

Method: The approach uses a synthetic dataset (TempTabQA-C) and symbolic intermediate representation (database schemas) with adaptive few-shot prompting for SQL query generation and execution.

Result: The method enhances generalization, mitigates biases, and achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance.

Conclusion: TempTabQA-C sets a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning in LLMs, addressing key challenges effectively.

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and

TL;DR: Writing-RL is an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that improves long-form writing beyond supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by addressing data saturation and limited learning capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT approaches for LLMs suffer from data saturation and restricted learning capacity, limiting long-form writing performance.

Method: The framework includes Margin-aware Data Selection, Pairwise Comparison Reward, and Dynamic Reference Scheduling to adaptively adjust task difficulty.

Result: Experiments on 7B-scale models show significant improvements in long-form writing over SFT baselines, with surprising generalization to long-input reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Writing-RL offers a promising direction for advancing long-context training and rethinking long-form capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

TL;DR: BioMol-MQA introduces a multimodal QA dataset for polypharmacy, combining text and molecular structures in a KG, highlighting LLMs' struggles without strong RAG frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG-based LLMs focus on single-modality (text) retrieval, but real-world problems like healthcare require multimodal (KG, text, molecular structures) retrieval and reasoning.

Method: Developed BioMol-MQA, a QA dataset with a multimodal KG (text and molecular structures) and challenging questions to test LLMs' retrieval and reasoning over multimodal data.

Result: Benchmarks show LLMs struggle without proper background data, emphasizing the need for robust RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: BioMol-MQA addresses the gap in multimodal retrieval for LLMs, underscoring the importance of advanced RAG frameworks for complex domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

Method: Uses a MoE architecture with 14B active parameters out of 142B total, trained on 11.2T high-quality tokens via a meticulous data pipeline, avoiding synthetic data.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-72B, with reduced costs, and open-sources intermediate checkpoints for research insights.

Conclusion: dots.llm1 demonstrates efficient scaling of language models via MoE, offering cost-effective performance and open resources for further study.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for
scaling language models efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters
for each input token. In this report, we present dots.llm1, a large-scale MoE
model that activates 14B parameters out of a total of 142B parameters,
delivering performance on par with state-of-the-art models while reducing
training and inference costs. Leveraging our meticulously crafted and efficient
data processing pipeline, dots.llm1 achieves performance comparable to
Qwen2.5-72B after pretraining on 11.2T high-quality tokens and post-training to
fully unlock its capabilities. Notably, no synthetic data is used during
pretraining. To foster further research, we open-source intermediate training
checkpoints at every one trillion tokens, providing valuable insights into the
learning dynamics of large language models.

*Minghan Wang,Ye Bai,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Shareghi,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show awareness of time passage, adapting responses under time pressure, validated through experiments like dialogue duration judgment and BombRush.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs perceive time passage and adapt decision-making, given their success in temporal reasoning tasks.

Method: Three experiments: Token-Time Hypothesis validation, response length adaptation under urgency, and BombRush for time-pressure behavior.

Result: LLMs exhibit time awareness, linking tokens to physical time, varying by model size and reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs can perceive time, enabling time-sensitive applications, with potential for further enhancement.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

*Ye Bai,Minghan Wang,Thuy-Trang Vu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPLE is a multi-agent framework for table-based QA, mimicking human problem-solving with adaptive planning and long-term memory, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex reasoning in table-based QA, lacking error detection and experience reuse, unlike humans.

Method: MAPLE uses 4 components: Solver (ReAct), Checker, Reflector, and Archiver, working in a feedback loop for adaptive planning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on WiKiTQ and TabFact across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MAPLE effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by emulating human-like problem-solving with multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

TL;DR: FinanceReasoning is a benchmark for evaluating large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical reasoning, offering credibility, comprehensiveness, and challenge improvements over existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of credible, comprehensive, and challenging benchmarks for evaluating LRMs in financial numerical reasoning.

Method: Updated 15.6% of questions from public datasets, annotated 908 new questions with Python solutions, and constructed 3,133 Python-formatted functions. Introduced 238 Hard problems requiring multiple financial formulas.

Result: Improved LRM performance (e.g., GPT-4o accuracy rose from 83.2% to 91.6%). Best model (OpenAI o1 with PoT) achieved 89.1% accuracy. Combining Reasoner and Programmer models further enhanced performance (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 from 83.2% to 87.8%).

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning advances LRM evaluation and improvement in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks, highlighting challenges in numerical precision.

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

*Cheonbok Park,Jeonghoon Kim,Joosung Lee,Sanghwan Bae,Jaegul Choo,Kangmin Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies Cross-lingual Collapse in multilingual language models, where reasoning reverts to the dominant pre-training language. Fine-tuning with GRPO reveals imbalances and irreversible language erosion, highlighting unequal training for reasoning across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs) and address the drift toward dominant pre-training languages.

Method: Fine-tune multilingual LRMs with GRPO on translated datasets (GSM8K, SimpleRL-Zoo) in Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian, monitoring task accuracy and language consistency.

Result: GRPO amplifies language imbalances, causing irreversible erosion of low-resource languages. Language consistency reward mitigates drift but reduces accuracy by 5-10 pp.

Conclusion: Not all languages are trained equally for reasoning; reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors play critical roles in multilingual reasoning.

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

*Chenyang Shao,Xinyang Liu,Yutang Lin,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2-Reasoner is a framework for collaborative reasoning across LLMs and SLMs, reducing costs by 86.85% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid approaches for efficient multi-step reasoning in LLMs are needed to balance cost and performance.

Method: Uses a Reinforced Model Router for task decomposition and subtask allocation, trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Reduces API costs by 86.85% without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner enables cost-effective, adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: MisMitiFact is an efficient framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses to misinformation, using lightweight critique models to refine LLM outputs, achieving high throughput and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fact-checking is costly and lacks scalability, while LLMs risk hallucinating non-factual information. Existing methods relying on LLM self-feedback are computationally expensive.

Method: MisMitiFact generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, using lightweight, fine-grained critique models trained on fact-checking data to correct errors in key elements.

Result: MisMitiFact produces counter-responses of comparable quality to LLM self-feedback while achieving a ~5x increase in feedback generation throughput.

Conclusion: MisMitiFact is highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale misinformation mitigation, with code and templates available.

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a heterogeneous Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA) approach to improve parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in LLMs, addressing issues like representation collapse and expert load imbalance in homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing homogeneous MoE-LoRA architectures suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance, limiting LLM performance.

Method: Proposes heterogeneous MoA with two variants: Soft MoA (weighted fusion of expert outputs) and Sparse MoA (sparse expert activation).

Result: MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA in performance and parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The heterogeneous MoA approach enhances knowledge transfer in LLMs and is more efficient than existing methods.

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

TL;DR: DynamicMind introduces a tri-mode thinking system (Fast, Normal, Slow) for LLMs to adapt reasoning depth dynamically, improving zero-shot QA performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' inability to dynamically adjust reasoning depth for varying task complexities, leading to inefficiency or suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes a tri-mode thinking system, Thinking Density metric, and Mind Router for optimal mode selection in zero-shot QA tasks.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and computational efficiency across diverse QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: DynamicMind effectively balances performance and efficiency in zero-shot QA tasks.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IntentionESC framework and ICECoT mechanism to improve emotional support conversations by clarifying supporter intentions and enhancing LLM responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear intentions in emotional support conversations can lead to inappropriate strategies, necessitating a structured approach to guide supporters.

Method: Proposes IntentionESC for defining intentions and ICECoT to enable LLMs to infer intentions and select strategies. Uses automated annotation for training and a comprehensive evaluation scheme.

Result: Validates the framework through experiments, showing improved emotional support responses.

Conclusion: The IntentionESC and ICECoT framework enhances emotional support by aligning intentions with strategies, leveraging LLMs effectively.

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based system for generating Math Word Problems (MWPs) without requiring additional inputs, addressing the inefficiency of manual creation and limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High failure rates in math exams due to perceived complexity and the time-consuming nature of manually creating MWPs. Existing methods require extra inputs, which limits their practicality.

Method: The system uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate MWPs, requiring only the number of problems, grade, and question type as input. Experiments tested various LLMs, prompting strategies, and techniques to enhance diversity and performance.

Result: Generated MWPs were high in quality with minimal grammar/spelling issues, but LLMs struggled with adhering to grade and question type specifications.

Conclusion: The LLM-based system effectively generates MWPs but needs improvement in aligning with specific grade and question type requirements.

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, a new inference-time method to enhance Theory of Mind (ToM) in LLMs, applicable to broader scenarios without world-state changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM methods in LLMs are limited to specific contexts, and fine-tuning degrades generalization. SoO prefixing aims to address these limitations.

Method: SoO prefixing involves starting LLM outputs with "Let's put ourselves in A's shoes," where A is the target character, to improve ToM performance.

Result: SoO prefixing consistently improves ToM across five mental state categories in conversational and narrative benchmarks.

Conclusion: SoO prefixing effectively enhances ToM in LLMs by eliciting faithful thoughts, making it versatile for broader scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

TL;DR: Tau-Eval is an open-source framework for benchmarking text anonymization methods, balancing privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text anonymization involves a trade-off between privacy and utility, but lacks a universal benchmark for evaluation.

Method: Developed Tau-Eval, a Python-based framework, to assess anonymization techniques via privacy and utility task sensitivity.

Result: Tau-Eval provides tools (library, code, docs, tutorials) for benchmarking anonymization methods.

Conclusion: Tau-Eval addresses the gap in evaluating anonymization techniques, offering a practical solution for researchers.

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.

### [50] [A Culturally-Rich Romanian NLP Dataset from "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05991)
*Alexandru-Gabriel Ganea,Antonia-Adelina Popovici,Adrian-Marius Dumitran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM performance across languages and cultures using a Romanian game show dataset, revealing disparities in accuracy between international and culturally-specific questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how cultural context and language affect LLM performance and improve multilingual NLP systems.

Method: Collected a multilingual dataset from a Romanian game show using OCR, text extraction, and manual verification, then benchmarked LLMs on it.

Result: LLMs performed better on international questions (80-95%) than Romanian-specific ones (50-75%). Translation and cross-lingual tests further highlighted cultural impact.

Conclusion: Cultural context significantly influences LLM performance, emphasizing the need for culturally-aware NLP systems, especially in education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

### [51] [Token Signature: Predicting Chain-of-Thought Gains with Token Decoding Feature in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06008)
*Peijie Liu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, proposing indicators based on token probability distributions to assess CoT gains and introducing Dynamic CoT for efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand inconsistent CoT performance gains and improve efficiency by dynamically selecting between CoT and direct answers.

Method: Proposes token probability-based indicators, combines them with logistic regression for Dynamic CoT, and extends the method to closed-source models.

Result: Indicators achieve 89.2% accuracy; Dynamic CoT reduces token use by 35% while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides insights into CoT mechanisms and a framework for efficient deployment, balancing performance and resource use.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

*Haoke Zhang,Xiaobo Liang,Cunxiang Wang,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AvR (Alignment via Refinement) enhances LLMs' recursive reasoning via long-form CoT, outperforming preference optimization methods with a 20% win rate boost on AlpacaEval 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack recursive thinking capabilities without expert-curated data. AvR aims to unlock this potential.

Method: AvR integrates criticism and improvement actions with differentiable learning to optimize refinement-aware rewards, organizing multi-round data as long refinement thoughts.

Result: AvR outperforms conventional methods, boosting LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct's win rate by over 20% with just 3k synthetic samples.

Conclusion: AvR effectively enhances LLM reasoning, demonstrating significant performance gains with minimal data.

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

*Yu Li,Lehui Li,Zhihao Wu,Qingmin Liao,Jianye Hao,Kun Shao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve LLM agent design by addressing workflow optimization, evaluation costs, and search efficiency, achieving 8.34% better performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent search methods underuse human-designed components, incur high evaluation costs, and struggle with large search spaces.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical search space, a predictive value model for performance estimation, and a hierarchical MCTS strategy for efficient search.

Result: Achieves an average 8.34% performance gain over baselines across seven benchmarks, with faster search progress.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses key challenges in LLM agent design, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

TL;DR: SR-DCR is a lightweight framework using self-confidence and multi-agent debate to resolve conflicts between parametric knowledge and contextual input, improving reliability without heavy computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address factual inconsistencies or hallucinations in large language models when parametric knowledge clashes with contextual input.

Method: Integrates token-level self-confidence with asymmetric multi-agent debate (critic, defender, judge) to evaluate context reliability and select answers.

Result: Outperforms classical debate and confidence-only baselines on ClashEval, enhancing robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: SR-DCR effectively balances reliability and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for contextual conflicts in language models.

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at

TL;DR: FEEDER is a pre-selection framework for ICL that reduces computational costs by identifying a representative subset of demonstrations, maintaining performance while improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL methods are computationally expensive due to repeated retrieval from large datasets. FEEDER aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: FEEDER uses 'sufficiency' and 'necessity' metrics and a tree-based algorithm to pre-select a representative subset of demonstrations. It also employs a bi-level optimization method for fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: Experiments show FEEDER reduces training data size by over 20% without performance loss, working with various downstream strategies.

Conclusion: FEEDER efficiently replaces full training data in ICL, improving computational efficiency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

*Zhitao He,Zongwei Lyu,Dazhong Chen,Dadi Guo,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATP-BENCH, a multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs as automated theorem provers, highlighting their current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of MLLMs as multimodal automated theorem provers, given their success in solving mathematical problems.

Method: Developed MATP-BENCH, a benchmark with 1056 multimodal theorems from various math levels, formalized in Lean 4, Coq, and Isabelle.

Result: Existing MLLMs solve only a limited number of MATP-BENCH problems, indicating a significant challenge.

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH presents an open challenge for advancing automated theorem proving research.

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CatShift is a label-only framework for detecting unauthorized dataset usage in LLMs by leveraging catastrophic forgetting, without needing internal model logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting unauthorized dataset usage in LLMs, especially when log probabilities are unavailable.

Method: Uses catastrophic forgetting: fine-tuning on suspicious data triggers output shifts, compared to non-member validation sets.

Result: Effective in logit-inaccessible settings, validated on open-source and API-based LLMs.

Conclusion: Provides a robust solution for protecting proprietary data in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

*Yingqi Hu,Zhuo Zhang,Jingyuan Zhang,Lizhen Qu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces extraction attack algorithms for FedLLMs, operating under a realistic threat model, and evaluates their effectiveness in extracting PII, highlighting vulnerabilities and the need for defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the risk of data extraction in FedLLMs due to their memorization ability, focusing on a realistic threat model where attackers access only one client's data.

Method: Develops extraction attack algorithms leveraging contextual prefixes and evaluates them using coverage rate and efficiency metrics on a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations.

Result: The method extracts up to 56.57% of victim-exclusive PII, with 'Address,' 'Birthday,' and 'Name' being most vulnerable.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for robust defense strategies and provide a benchmark for future privacy-preserving federated learning research.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot method (ATC) for detecting LLM-generated code by leveraging task-level conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting LLM-generated code for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.

Method: Uses conditional probability distributions, focusing on task-level differences, and approximates the original task (ATC) for detection without needing the generator LLM or original prompts.

Result: ATC outperforms existing methods, generalizing across programming languages (Python, CPP, Java).

Conclusion: Task-level conditioning is crucial for detecting LLM-generated code, and ATC offers a practical, effective solution.

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRIAD introduces a curated corpus of medical QA pairs to improve LLM accuracy and reduce hallucinations in healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate inaccurate medical content, and existing RAG pipelines use noisy, unstructured text, lacking systematic organization.

Method: MIRIAD creates 5.8M QA pairs from peer-reviewed literature via a semi-automated pipeline (LLM generation, filtering, grounding, human annotation).

Result: MIRIAD improves LLM accuracy by 6.7% and hallucination detection by 22.5-37% (F1 score) over unstructured RAG baselines.

Conclusion: MIRIAD enables reliable LLM applications in healthcare through targeted retrieval and interactive exploration via MIRIAD-Atlas.

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

*Atharv Kulkarni,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution-based feedback to improve SQL query generation from natural language, achieving significant accuracy gains without supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if a large language model (LLM) can be tuned for SQL generation by interacting with a database engine, avoiding the need for supervised fine-tuning with text-code pairs.

Method: Framed as an RL problem, the model receives scalar rewards from database execution feedback (penalizing failures, rewarding correct answers) and uses the GRPO framework. Evaluated on a tabular reasoning benchmark.

Result: RL-tuning improved SQL generation accuracy from 31.49 to 49.83 and reduced errors from 25.43% to 14.71%, nearly matching the performance of the larger SQLCoder-70B model.

Conclusion: Execution-based feedback can effectively enhance LLMs' symbolic reasoning, demonstrating a viable alternative to supervised fine-tuning for code generation tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs can capture multiple perspectives in subjective tasks like hate speech detection, but few-shot setups struggle with human disagreement. Prompt design and demonstration selection impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can reflect annotator disagreement and capture multiple perspectives in subjective NLP tasks.

Method: Used in-context learning (ICL) in zero-shot and few-shot settings with four open-source LLMs, evaluating three label modeling strategies and various demonstration selection methods.

Result: Multi-perspective generation works in zero-shot, but few-shot often fails to capture human judgments fully. Prompt design and demonstration selection affect performance.

Conclusion: Modeling subjectivity with LLMs is challenging; more perspective-aware models are needed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A phonetic correction system improves ASR accuracy for underrepresented movie titles by generating phonetic alternatives and rescoring them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality ASR training data is costly, and recent or infrequent movie titles may be poorly recognized due to insufficient representation in training data.

Method: The system includes (a) phonetic search for generating alternatives and (b) a rescorer to combine and select the best output.

Result: Improves word error rate by 4.4-7.6% relative on movie title benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed phonetic correction system effectively enhances ASR performance for underrepresented terms.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CONFER, a dataset to evaluate NLI models' handling of pragmatic inferences in conditional sentences, finding they struggle with presuppositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore NLI models' underexplored ability to handle fine-grained pragmatic inferences, especially presupposition in conditionals.

Method: Introduces CONFER dataset; evaluates four NLI models and LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, DeepSeek-R1) in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Result: NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning; fine-tuning on existing datasets doesn't improve performance.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations of NLI models in conditional reasoning and suggests need for better approaches.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

### [65] [semantic-features: A User-Friendly Tool for Studying Contextual Word Embeddings in Interpretable Semantic Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06169)
*Jwalanthi Ranganathan,Rohan Jha,Kanishka Misra,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'semantic-features,' a library for analyzing contextualized word embeddings, and applies it to study the semantic effects of dative constructions in sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an easy-to-use tool for studying contextualized word embeddings and explore how dative constructions influence semantic interpretations in language models.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 450 sentence pairs with ambiguous recipients and used the 'semantic-features' library to analyze embeddings from three masked language models.

Result: The embeddings showed expected sensitivities, indicating that dative constructions affect semantic interpretations (e.g., animacy of 'London').

Conclusion: The tool is promising for studying contextualized embeddings and their semantic implications.

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

### [66] [Does It Run and Is That Enough? Revisiting Text-to-Chart Generation with a Multi-Agent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06175)
*James Ford,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent pipeline using GPT-4o-mini reduces execution errors in chart-generation code from 15% to 4.5%, but issues like hallucinations and accessibility remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if persistent errors in chart-generation code stem from model limitations or single-prompt design.

Method: Proposes a lightweight multi-agent pipeline (drafting, execution, repair, judgment) using GPT-4o-mini.

Result: Error rates drop to 4.5% (Text2Chart31) and 4.6% (ChartX), outperforming baselines. Manual review reveals hallucinations and poor accessibility.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and accessibility rather than execution reliability.

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

*Ju Yong Sim,Seong Hwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning Llama3 with VP evaluation criteria in prompts outperforms CoT for VP detection, matching GPT-4 performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address voice phishing (VP) detection by leveraging small LMs like Llama3, and explore the impact of human expert knowledge (via prompts) vs. CoT techniques.

Method: Fine-tune Llama3 with VP evaluation criteria in prompts, apply CoT, and test on adversarial datasets. Compare performance with and without criteria/CoT.

Result: Llama3-8B with VP criteria in prompts performs best among small LMs, comparable to GPT-4. Human expert knowledge in prompts is more effective than CoT.

Conclusion: Incorporating human expert knowledge into prompts is superior to CoT for small LMs in VP detection, achieving GPT-4-level performance.

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PuzzleWorld is a benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems to test open-ended, multimodal reasoning in models, revealing poor performance (1-14% accuracy) and highlighting the need for better reasoning and sketching capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve foundation models' ability in open-ended, creative reasoning, mirroring real-world problem-solving like scientific discovery or data analysis.

Method: Introduces PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark with annotated solutions, reasoning traces, and skill labels, and evaluates state-of-the-art models on it.

Result: Most models perform poorly (1-2% accuracy), with the best at 14%. Fine-tuning on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning (4% to 11%), while final answers alone degrade performance.

Conclusion: Current models struggle with open-ended reasoning, lacking multimodal and sketching skills. PuzzleWorld aims to advance general, creative reasoning systems.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for accelerating physics research but lack physical intuition and reliable reasoning. Future specialized LLMs could handle multimodal data and propose hypotheses, but challenges like physical consistency must be addressed. Collaboration between physics and AI is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in advancing theoretical, computational, and applied physics by addressing current limitations and envisioning future capabilities.

Method: Analyzes current LLM capabilities in physics (e.g., mathematical reasoning, code generation) and identifies gaps (e.g., physical intuition, constraint satisfaction). Proposes future physics-specialized LLMs with multimodal data handling and hypothesis generation.

Result: Identifies critical gaps in LLMs for physics applications and outlines a vision for future specialized models.

Conclusion: Collaboration between physics and AI communities is essential to overcome challenges (e.g., physical consistency) and realize the potential of LLMs in advancing physics research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains,
yet their application in theoretical physics research is not yet mature. This
position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate
theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with
domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics
-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps
in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We
envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts
between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in
physics.

### [71] [Explaining Matters: Leveraging Definitions and Semantic Expansion for Sexism Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06238)
*Sahrish Khan,Arshad Jhumka,Gabriele Pergola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting sexism online, proposing two prompt-based data augmentation techniques and an ensemble strategy to improve model performance on the EDOS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sexism detection in online content is difficult due to data sparsity, nuanced language, and class imbalance. Existing systems struggle with generalization and annotator disagreement.

Method: The authors propose Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA) and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE) for data augmentation, and an ensemble strategy for fine-grained classification.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EDOS dataset, with macro F1 improvements of 1.5 points for binary classification and 4.1 points for fine-grained classification.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively address data sparsity and nuanced language challenges, enhancing sexism detection performance.

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

*Yi Sui,Chaozhuo Li,Chen Zhang,Dawei song,Qiuchi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSSP-RAG improves RAG by resolving conflicts between external and parametric knowledge in LLMs using mixed-attention and unsupervised hallucination detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods degrade due to unresolved knowledge conflicts in LLMs.

Method: Proposes DSSP-RAG with mixed-attention for shared-private semantic synergy, hallucination detection, and EQ-based noise reduction.

Result: Outperforms baselines by resolving conflicts and enhancing knowledge complementarity.

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG effectively integrates and refines knowledge for better performance and stability.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

*Sabri Eyuboglu,Ryan Ehrlich,Simran Arora,Neel Guha,Dylan Zinsley,Emily Liu,Will Tennien,Atri Rudra,James Zou,Azalia Mirhoseini,Christopher Re*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Cartridge,' a smaller KV cache trained offline on a corpus, to reduce memory costs and improve efficiency compared to in-context learning (ICL). Self-study, a synthetic conversation-based training method, enhances Cartridge performance, matching ICL while being cheaper and more scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models using ICL for corpus-based queries are costly due to high memory consumption. The goal is to find a more efficient alternative.

Method: Train a smaller KV cache (Cartridge) offline using self-study, a method involving synthetic conversations and context-distillation, instead of naive next-token prediction.

Result: Cartridges with self-study match ICL performance, use 38.6x less memory, enable 26.4x higher throughput, and extend effective context length.

Conclusion: Self-study-trained Cartridges offer a cost-effective, scalable alternative to ICL, with additional benefits like context length extension and composability.

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdvSumm is a training framework to reduce bias in LLM-based text summarization using adversarial perturbations, improving robustness without losing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit biases from pre-training data, leading to unfair outputs in summarization tasks.

Method: AdvSumm introduces a Perturber component for gradient-guided embedding-level perturbations in Seq2Seq models.

Result: AdvSumm effectively reduces name-nationality and political framing biases while maintaining summarization quality.

Conclusion: AdvSumm outperforms standard transformers and data augmentation in bias mitigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvidenceOutcomes, a large annotated corpus for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from biomedical literature, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks often neglect or oversimplify Outcomes in PICO elements, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: Developed annotation guidelines with experts, annotated 500 PubMed abstracts, and fine-tuned PubMedBERT for outcome extraction.

Result: Achieved high inter-rater agreement (0.76) and PubMedBERT F1-scores (0.69 entity, 0.76 token).

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes provides a robust benchmark for future machine learning algorithms in outcome extraction.

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs equipped with retrieval-augmented generation and self-correction outperform encoder-decoder models in SRL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between generative LLMs and encoder-decoder models in semantic role labeling (SRL).

Method: Introduces retrieval-augmented generation (leveraging external linguistic knowledge) and self-correction (identifying and fixing inconsistent outputs) for LLMs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012 benchmarks in Chinese and English.

Conclusion: First successful application of LLMs surpassing encoder-decoder models in SRL.

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

TL;DR: R2AG, a reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation, outperforms baselines by retrieving reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph and using group-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods struggle with long-form note generation from limited patient data.

Method: R2AG uses reinforcement learning to retrieve reasoning paths and Group-Based Retriever Optimization (GRO) to improve retrieval quality.

Result: R2AG outperforms baselines in clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics, filling semantic gaps and avoiding misinterpretation.

Conclusion: R2AG effectively generates long-form clinical notes by leveraging retrieved reasoning paths and explicit semantic guidance.

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decoding methods like top-k and nucleus sampling fail to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation, prompting the need for an improved approach.

Method: ASTS enhances Locally Typical Sampling (LTS) with dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments.

Result: ASTS outperforms existing methods in benchmarks like story generation and summarization, reducing repetition and improving semantic alignment and fluency.

Conclusion: ASTS is a superior decoding strategy for LLMs, offering better performance in generating coherent and diverse text efficiently.

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited German-language corpora hinder NLP and CSS research, especially on societal issues like gender bias.

Method: A scalable, structured analysis pipeline is used to study gender representation, actor mentions, sentiment, and framing in the corpus.

Result: Men are consistently overrepresented, but coverage is becoming more balanced. The corpus enables diverse applications in NLP and media studies.

Conclusion: taz2024full fosters inclusive, reproducible research in German NLP and CSS, supporting studies on linguistic trends and societal biases.

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

*Shenyang Huang,Ali Parviz,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Zifeng Ding,Michael Bronstein,Reihaneh Rabbany,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TGTalker is a novel LLM-based framework for temporal graph learning, excelling in link prediction and offering explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' application on real-world dynamic graphs, addressing the gap in existing research.

Method: TGTalker leverages recency bias and temporal neighbors, converting graph data to natural language for LLMs.

Result: Competes with state-of-the-art TGNNs, outperforming TGN and HTGN, and provides textual explanations.

Conclusion: TGTalker advances temporal graph learning with LLMs, enhancing performance and explainability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Auto Review automates post-call verification in healthcare, reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy. A second-stage pipeline improves transcript quality by leveraging multiple ASR alternatives and pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual verification of noisy call transcripts is labor-intensive. Automating this process can save time and improve patient care.

Method: A two-stage system: Auto Review for initial automation and a second-stage pipeline using multiple ASR alternatives and pseudo-labeling to enhance transcript accuracy.

Result: Experiments show improved transcript quality, enhancing Auto Review's efficiency without needing manually corrected transcripts.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline significantly reduces manual effort and improves accuracy in healthcare benefit verification calls.

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AsymKV, a training-free compression framework for KV caches in LLMs, leveraging key-value asymmetry to improve long-context modeling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in LLMs limits efficient long-context modeling, and existing KV cache compression methods overlook key-value asymmetry.

Method: Proposes AsymKV, combining homogeneity-based key merging with lossless value compression, addressing the asymmetry in KV caches.

Result: AsymKV outperforms SOTA methods, achieving 43.95 on LongBench with LLaMA3.1-8B, surpassing H$_2$O (38.89).

Conclusion: AsymKV effectively addresses the limitations of uniform KV cache compression, offering superior performance for long-context tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To computationally predict which Wordle games users find amusing, leveraging Reddit reactions.

Method: Scraped 80k Reddit reactions, classified amusement using GPT-3.5, and extracted predictive game features.

Result: Features weakly predict amusement, showing measurable creativity in Wordle games.

Conclusion: User amusement in Wordle is predictable, revealing aspects of humor-infused creativity.

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with dynamic real-world scenarios requiring continuous learning; existing CL benchmarks and methods are limited.

Method: Proposes parameter isolation and an MLLM-based routing mechanism to prevent catastrophic interference.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by integrating new knowledge and skills with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: MLLM-CL effectively addresses continual learning in MLLMs, offering a robust solution for dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses unsupervised machine learning to analyze language development in children with and without SLI, revealing distinct clusters and challenging traditional diagnostic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early identification and intervention for SLI by uncovering natural language development trajectories beyond standardized assessments.

Method: Analyzed narrative samples from 1,163 children using PCA and clustering on 64 linguistic features.

Result: Identified two clusters: high production/low SLI and limited production/high syntactic complexity/high SLI, supporting a continuum model.

Conclusion: SLI is linked to reduced production capacity, not syntactic deficits, advocating for refined diagnostic and intervention approaches.

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

### [88] [Improving LLMs with a knowledge from databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05560)
*Petr Máša*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method using enhanced association rules improves LLM answers via RAG, outperforming ChatGPT and offering future enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of control and safety in LLM-generated commands while improving answer accuracy for dataset-based questions.

Method: Generates a ruleset from knowledge patterns, converts rules to text, and integrates them into LLM via RAG.

Result: Significant improvement in answering dataset-based questions compared to ChatGPT, even with agents.

Conclusion: The method is promising, with potential for further enhancements like rule mining as an agent or incorporating additional patterns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system using large language models for clinical question answering from EHRs, focusing on sentence relevance and response generation, with improved performance using few-shot prompting and self-consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of answering clinical questions from EHRs by leveraging large language models for sentence selection and response generation.

Method: Uses two-step approach: 1) identifying relevant EHR sentences using few-shot prompting, self-consistency, and thresholding; 2) generating citation-supported responses. Compares model sizes (8B vs. 70B).

Result: Smaller 8B model outperforms larger 70B model for sentence selection. Accurate sentence selection is key for high-quality responses, and self-consistency with thresholding improves reliability.

Conclusion: Effective clinical QA requires precise sentence selection, achievable with smaller models and techniques like self-consistency and thresholding.

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

TL;DR: SynthesizeMe introduces a method to create synthetic user personas from interactions for personalized reward modeling, improving LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the reliance on additional identity information in personalized reward models by leveraging user interactions.

Method: Generates and verifies reasoning for user preferences, induces synthetic personas, and filters interactions to build personalized prompts.

Result: Improves personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% and achieves top performance on PersonalRewardBench.

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe effectively enhances personalized reward modeling without needing predefined user categories.

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing LLMs' capability to mimic real user behaviors is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets.

Method: Developed OPERA dataset using an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to collect real user data.

Result: OPERA provides the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' prediction of user actions and rationales.

Conclusion: OPERA enables future research on LLM agents as personalized digital twins for humans.

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

TL;DR: The paper explores gender confounding in dementia detection using transformer models, proposing two methods to mitigate bias, with trade-offs in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored effects of speaker gender in Alzheimer's disease detection using pre-trained language models.

Method: Proposes the Extended Confounding Filter and Dual Filter to isolate and ablate gender-related weights in transformer models.

Result: Transformer models overfit to training data; disrupting gender-related weights deconfounds the classifier but slightly reduces detection performance.

Conclusion: Gender confounding can be mitigated in dementia detection, though with a minor trade-off in accuracy.

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models is costly and complex; parameter-efficient methods like soft prompting are needed.

Method: ID-SPAM generates soft prompts based on input tokens and uses self-attention to vary token importance, keeping trainable parameters minimal.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances zero-shot domain transfer.

Conclusion: ID-SPAM is an efficient, effective solution for domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream
tasks by learning a small set of parameters. We propose a novel Input Dependent
Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of language technologies in detecting and interpreting extremist in-group language (cryptolects).

Method: Evaluated eight models across six tasks, focusing on detection and decoding of extremist language. Used domain adaptation and specialized prompting techniques.

Result: General-purpose LLMs fail consistently, but performance improves with domain-specific adjustments.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for tailored approaches in automated moderation and provides new datasets for future research.

Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as
cryptolects, to exclude or mislead outsiders. We investigate the ability of
current language technologies to detect and interpret the cryptolects of two
online extremist platforms. Evaluating eight models across six tasks, our
results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode
extremist language. However, performance can be significantly improved by
domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide
important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated
moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and
unlabelled datasets, including 19.4M posts from extremist platforms and
lexicons validated by human experts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new dataset is proposed to study fact memorization and verbatim sequence memorization in language models, using synthetic, fictional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how language models memorize facts and verbatim sequences from training data is not well explored.

Method: A synthetic dataset of fictional events and question-answer pairs is created and used in training experiments.

Result: The synthetic data helps distinguish between different forms of memorization, though creating realistic fictional data is challenging.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset aids in studying memorization processes, highlighting challenges in synthetic data realism.

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CulturalPersonas is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally rich contexts, improving alignment with human norms across six countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked interplay between culture and personality in LLMs, crucial for applications like tutoring and mental health.

Method: Introduce CulturalPersonas, a dataset of 3,000 scenario-based questions across six countries, evaluated using multiple-choice and open-ended formats.

Result: LLMs show improved alignment with human personality distributions (20% reduction in Wasserstein distance) and more culturally coherent outputs.

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas bridges personality and culture, paving the way for globally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

TL;DR: MEFA is a zero-shot framework for Event Causality Identification (ECI) that uses Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation to reduce causal hallucination in LLMs, outperforming baselines by 6.2% in F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECI models rely on supervised methods needing large annotated data, and LLMs in zero-shot ECI suffer from causal hallucination.

Method: MEFA decomposes causality into tasks, uses prompts for LLM responses, and aggregates evidence via fuzzy logic for scoring.

Result: MEFA outperforms baselines by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, reducing hallucination errors.

Conclusion: Task decomposition and fuzzy aggregation in MEFA effectively improve zero-shot ECI performance.

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified representation for Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency Grammar (DG), and Categorial Grammar (CG) using a correspondence principle, simplifying syntactic and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate and unify the representational principles of PSG, DG, and CG, addressing discontinuity in natural language and simplifying computational complexity.

Method: Introduces the correspondence principle and demonstrates its application using a discontinuous subordinate clause from Turkish.

Result: Achieves a unified representation that simplifies syntactic analysis and computational complexity for continuous and discontinuous sentences.

Conclusion: The unified approach integrates PSG, DG, and CG, offering theoretical and computational benefits for syntactic analysis.

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

TL;DR: GraphRAG-Bench evaluates GraphRAG's effectiveness, comparing it to vanilla RAG, and identifies scenarios where graph structures enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show GraphRAG underperforms vanilla RAG, raising questions about its effectiveness and optimal use cases.

Method: Proposes GraphRAG-Bench, a benchmark with diverse tasks and systematic evaluation of GraphRAG's pipeline.

Result: Identifies conditions where GraphRAG outperforms traditional RAG and provides practical guidelines.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench offers a tool to understand and apply GraphRAG effectively, with resources available for the community.

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

### [101] [Being Strong Progressively! Enhancing Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models through a Curriculum Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05695)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel curriculum learning framework (POCL) improves knowledge distillation for LLMs by progressively introducing training samples from easy to hard, enhancing stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for LLMs suffer from distribution shifts, causing issues like catastrophic forgetting and training-inference mismatch.

Method: POCL uses a difficulty measurer to rank samples and a training scheduler to introduce them progressively with rising loss temperatures.

Result: POCL consistently improves student model performance across various KD methods and model families.

Conclusion: Structured training data in KD enhances stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

### [103] [Large Language Models are Good Relational Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05725)
*Fang Wu,Vijay Prakash Dwivedi,Jure Leskovec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rel-LLM introduces a GNN-based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs, preserving database structures and improving performance in relational deep learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods serialize relational data into text, losing structure and causing redundancy, which limits LLM effectiveness in relational tasks.

Method: Uses a GNN encoder to extract local subgraphs, creating feature representations with relational and temporal dependencies, then transforms these into structured prompts for LLMs.

Result: Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on relational deep learning tasks, offering scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Rel-LLM provides a novel, effective way to integrate LLMs with structured data, preserving relational integrity and enhancing reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is
available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating machine unlearning in LLMs using knowledge graphs and LLM judges to assess implicit knowledge retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods focus on explicit fact removal, ignoring latent dependencies and non-deterministic knowledge in LLMs, leading to potential implicit retention.

Method: Proposes a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework using knowledge graphs and confidence scores, with LLM judges for inference-based evaluation.

Result: The framework provides a more realistic assessment, revealing current strategies overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a rigorous and accurate evaluation of unlearning performance, highlighting gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prompting methods for LLMs struggle with temporal tabular QA due to memorization, table size sensitivity, and poor performance on complex queries.

Method: Introduces TempTabQA-C dataset and a symbolic intermediate representation to convert tables into database schemas, enabling SQL query generation and execution. Uses adaptive few-shot prompting with tailored examples.

Result: Achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance, setting a new benchmark for temporal reasoning with LLMs.

Conclusion: The structured approach enhances generalization and mitigates biases, improving LLMs' performance on temporal tabular QA tasks.

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Writing-RL is an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that improves long-form writing beyond supervised fine-tuning, using margin-aware data selection, pairwise comparison rewards, and dynamic reference scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning approaches for LLMs suffer from data saturation and limited learning capacity, prompting the need for a more advanced framework.

Method: The framework includes margin-aware data selection, pairwise comparison rewards, and dynamic reference scheduling to adaptively adjust task difficulty.

Result: Experiments on 7B-scale models show significant improvement in long-form writing performance and unexpected generalization to long-input reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Writing-RL offers a promising approach for advancing long-form writing and rethinking long-context training in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioMol-MQA introduces a multimodal QA dataset for polypharmacy, combining text and molecular structures in a KG, highlighting LLMs' struggles without strong RAG frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG-based LLMs focus on single-modality (text) retrieval, but real-world problems like healthcare require multimodal (KG, text, molecular structures) retrieval and reasoning.

Method: Developed BioMol-MQA, a QA dataset with a multimodal KG (text and molecular structures) and challenging questions to test LLMs' retrieval and reasoning.

Result: Benchmarks show LLMs struggle without proper background data, emphasizing the need for robust RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: BioMol-MQA addresses the gap in multimodal retrieval and reasoning, underscoring the importance of advanced RAG frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for
scaling language models efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show awareness of time passage, adapting behavior based on token-time mapping, response urgency, and dynamic time pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs perceive and adapt to the passage of time, bridging linguistic tokens and physical time.

Method: Three experiments: Token-Time Hypothesis validation, urgency-based response adaptation, and BombRush navigation under time pressure.

Result: LLMs exhibit time awareness, varying by model size and reasoning ability, enabling temporal adaptation.

Conclusion: LLMs can perceive time, laying groundwork for enhancing temporal awareness in time-sensitive applications.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: MAPLE is a multi-agent framework for table-based QA, mimicking human problem-solving with adaptive planning and long-term memory, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex reasoning in table-based QA, lacking error detection and experience reuse, unlike human problem-solving.

Method: MAPLE uses 4 components: Solver (ReAct reasoning), Checker (answer verification), Reflector (error correction), and Archiver (long-term memory).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on WiKiTQ and TabFact datasets across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MAPLE's feedback-driven, multi-agent approach effectively addresses limitations of single-pass inference and enhances reasoning in table-based QA.

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accurate and comprehensive benchmarks for assessing LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Updated 15.6% of questions from public datasets, annotated 908 new questions with Python solutions, and constructed 3,133 Python-formatted functions. Introduced 238 Hard problems requiring multiple financial formulas.

Result: Improved LRM performance (e.g., GPT-4o accuracy rose from 83.2% to 91.6%). Best model (OpenAI o1 with PoT) achieved 89.1% accuracy, but numerical precision remains a challenge. Combining Reasoner and Programmer models further enhanced performance (e.g., 83.2% to 87.8% for DeepSeek-R1).

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning advances the evaluation and improvement of LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies Cross-lingual Collapse in multilingual language models, where reasoning reverts to the dominant pre-training language. It explores this using GRPO on translated datasets, revealing language imbalance amplification, trade-offs with accuracy, and irreversible damage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs) and investigate the drift toward dominant pre-training languages.

Method: Fine-tuned multilingual LRMs with GRPO on translated GSM8K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian, monitoring task accuracy and language consistency.

Result: GRPO amplifies language imbalances, language consistency reward mitigates drift but reduces accuracy, and the collapse is irreversible.

Conclusion: Not all languages are trained equally for reasoning; the study highlights the roles of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors.

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

*Chenyang Shao,Xinyang Liu,Yutang Lin,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2-Reasoner is a framework for collaborative reasoning across LLMs and SLMs, reducing costs by 86.85% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid approaches leveraging both LLMs and SLMs can improve efficiency, but require accurate task decomposition and allocation.

Method: Uses a Reinforced Model Router with a task decomposer and subtask allocator, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Reduces API costs by 86.85% while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner enables cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

*Xiaofei Xu,Xiuzhen Zhang,Ke Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MisMitiFact is an efficient framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses to misinformation, using lightweight critique models to refine LLM outputs, achieving high throughput and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fact-checking is costly and lacks scalability; LLMs can automate counter-response generation but suffer from hallucination. Existing methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes MisMitiFact, which uses fine-grained critique models trained on fact-checking data to refine LLM outputs, ensuring factual grounding.

Result: Generates counter-responses comparable to LLM self-feedback but with ~5x higher throughput and smaller models.

Conclusion: MisMitiFact is a cost-effective, scalable solution for misinformation mitigation, balancing quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a heterogeneous Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA) method to address issues in homogeneous MoE-LoRA architectures, enhancing performance and parameter efficiency in LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance, limiting LLM potential.

Method: MoA dynamically integrates diverse PEFT adapter experts, offering Soft MoA (weighted fusion) and Sparse MoA (sparse activation) variants.

Result: MoA outperforms homogeneous methods in performance and parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The heterogeneous MoA approach effectively transfers pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks, improving LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynamicMind introduces a tri-mode thinking system (Fast, Normal, Slow) for LLMs to adapt reasoning depth dynamically, improving zero-shot question answering performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with adapting reasoning depth to task complexity, leading to inefficiency or suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes a tri-mode thinking system, Thinking Density metric, and Mind Router for optimal mode selection.

Result: Superior zero-shot QA performance and balanced computational efficiency across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DynamicMind effectively balances performance and efficiency in LLMs for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

*Xinjie Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntentionESC and ICECoT to improve emotional support by clarifying supporter intentions and enhancing LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear intentions in emotional support can lead to inappropriate strategies, necessitating a framework to guide intentions and improve support.

Method: Proposes IntentionESC for intention definition and ICECoT for LLM reasoning, with automated annotation and evaluation.

Result: Validated framework improves emotional support responses by aligning intentions with strategies.

Conclusion: The IntentionESC and ICECoT framework enhances emotional support by clarifying intentions and leveraging expert knowledge.

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system using LLMs to generate Math Word Problems (MWPs) without additional inputs, improving efficiency and quality, though challenges remain in grade and question type adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-consuming nature of manually creating MWPs and the limitations of existing Deep Learning techniques requiring additional inputs.

Method: Developed an LLM-based MWP generation system requiring only the number of MWPs, grade, and question type. Explored various LLMs, prompting strategies, diversity techniques, and human feedback.

Result: Generated MWPs were high in quality with minimal language issues, but struggled with grade and question type adherence.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a promising solution for MWP generation but need further refinement to meet specific educational requirements.

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, a new inference-time method to enhance Theory of Mind (ToM) in LLMs, applicable to broader scenarios without degrading generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM methods for LLMs are limited to specific contexts (world state changes) and fine-tuning harms generalization. SoO prefixing aims to address these limitations.

Method: SoO prefixing involves prefacing LLM outputs with "Let's put ourselves in A's shoes." to improve ToM without context-specific assumptions.

Result: SoO prefixing improves ToM performance across five mental state categories in conversational and narrative benchmarks.

Conclusion: SoO prefixing is a simple, effective method for enhancing ToM in LLMs, eliciting faithful thoughts and broadening applicability.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of providing relevant document segments as context for classification with masked language models, especially for models with limited context windows.

Method: Uses entity-oriented heuristics for context selection and the XLM-RoBERTa language model.

Result: The approach performs on par with or better than supervised fine-tuning with larger generative language models.

Conclusion: Entity-oriented context selection is effective for classification tasks with limited context models.

Abstract: Our contribution to the SemEval 2025 shared task 10, subtask 1 on entity
framing, tackles the challenge of providing the necessary segments from longer
documents as context for classification with a masked language model. We show
that a simple entity-oriented heuristics for context selection can enable text

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tau-Eval is an open-source framework for benchmarking text anonymization methods, balancing privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text anonymization faces a trade-off between privacy and utility, lacking a universal benchmark.

Method: Developed Tau-Eval, a Python-based framework for evaluating anonymization techniques.

Result: Provides tools (library, code, docs) to assess anonymization methods.

Conclusion: Tau-Eval addresses the gap in benchmarking text anonymization for diverse contexts.

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM performance across languages using a Romanian game show dataset, revealing cultural biases and performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how cultural context and language affect LLM performance, especially in educational applications.

Method: Collected a multilingual dataset from a Romanian game show using OCR, text extraction, and manual verification, then benchmarked LLMs.

Result: LLMs performed better on international questions (80-95%) than Romanian-specific ones (50-75%), highlighting cultural bias.

Conclusion: Cultural context significantly impacts LLM performance, emphasizing the need for culturally-aware NLP systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: The paper explores the correlation between token probability monotonicity and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning effectiveness, proposing indicators to assess CoT performance and introducing Dynamic CoT for efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why CoT reasoning performance varies across tasks and improve its efficiency.

Method: Proposes token probability-based indicators, combines them with logistic regression for Dynamic CoT, and extends the method to closed-source models.

Result: Indicators achieve 89.2% accuracy; Dynamic CoT reduces token use by 35% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into CoT mechanisms and a framework for efficient CoT deployment.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

TL;DR: AvR (Alignment via Refinement) enhances LLMs' recursive reasoning via long-form CoT, outperforming traditional methods with a 20% win rate boost on AlpacaEval 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack recursive reasoning without expert-curated data. AvR aims to unlock this potential.

Method: AvR integrates criticism and improvement actions via differentiable learning, optimizing refinement-aware rewards.

Result: AvR boosts LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct's performance by 20% with just 3k synthetic samples.

Conclusion: AvR is a promising method for enhancing LLMs' recursive reasoning and performance.

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for improving LLM agent design by combining hierarchical search, predictive modeling, and MCTS, achieving 8.34% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing agent search methods, such as under-utilizing human-designed components, high evaluation costs, and inefficient search.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical search space, predictive value model, and hierarchical MCTS for efficient agent design.

Result: Achieves 8.34% average performance gain over baselines across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances agentic system design efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

TL;DR: SR-DCR is a lightweight framework using self-reflective debate to resolve conflicts between parametric knowledge and contextual input, improving reliability without significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address factual inconsistencies or hallucinations in large language models when parametric knowledge conflicts with contextual input.

Method: Integrates token-level self-confidence with asymmetric multi-agent debate (critic, defender, judge) to evaluate context reliability and select answers.

Result: Outperforms classical debate and confidence-only baselines on ClashEval, enhancing robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: SR-DCR effectively improves contextual reliability in language models with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at

TL;DR: FEEDER is a pre-selection framework for ICL that reduces computational costs by identifying a representative subset of demonstrations, improving efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL methods are computationally expensive due to repeated retrieval from large datasets. FEEDER aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: FEEDER uses "sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics and a tree-based algorithm to pre-select a representative subset of demonstrations. It also employs a bi-level optimization method for fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: Experiments show FEEDER reduces training data size by over 20% while maintaining performance across LLMs of varying sizes.

Conclusion: FEEDER efficiently pre-selects demonstrations, enhancing ICL and fine-tuning efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

### [130] [MATP-BENCH: Can MLLM Be a Good Automated Theorem Prover for Multimodal Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06034)
*Zhitao He,Zongwei Lyu,Dazhong Chen,Dadi Guo,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATP-BENCH, a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) in multimodal settings, highlighting their current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of MLLMs as multimodal ATPs and address the gap in evaluating their theorem-proving capabilities.

Method: Developed MATP-BENCH, a benchmark with 1056 multimodal theorems from various educational levels, formalized in Lean 4, Coq, and Isabelle.

Result: Existing MLLMs solve only a limited number of MATP-BENCH problems, indicating a significant challenge.

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH presents an open challenge for advancing research in multimodal automated theorem proving.

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

*Chen Xiong,Zihao Wang,Rui Zhu,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Jingwei Xiong,Haixu Tang,Lucila Ohno-Machado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CatShift is a label-only dataset-inference framework that detects unauthorized training data in LLMs by leveraging catastrophic forgetting, without needing internal model logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of LLMs on proprietary datasets risks copyright infringement, but existing methods depend on log probabilities, which are often unavailable.

Method: CatShift uses catastrophic forgetting: fine-tuning on suspicious data triggers output shifts, compared to non-member validation sets, to infer dataset membership.

Result: Experiments show CatShift effectively identifies training data in logit-inaccessible settings, providing a practical solution for data protection.

Conclusion: CatShift offers a robust, label-only approach to safeguard proprietary data in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

*Yingqi Hu,Zhuo Zhang,Jingyuan Zhang,Lizhen Qu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces extraction attack algorithms for Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models (FedLLMs), highlighting privacy risks and proposing metrics to evaluate attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of FedLLMs to data extraction attacks, especially under realistic threat models where attackers access limited client data.

Method: Develops extraction attack algorithms leveraging contextual prefixes and evaluates them using coverage rate and efficiency metrics on a real-world legal dataset.

Result: The method extracts up to 56.57% of victim-exclusive PII, with 'Address,' 'Birthday,' and 'Name' being most vulnerable.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for robust defenses and provide a benchmark for future privacy-preserving federated learning research.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

*Maor Ashkenazi,Ofir Brenner,Tal Furman Shohet,Eran Treister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot detection method for LLM-generated code by leveraging task-level conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art results without needing the generator LLM or original prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting LLM-generated code for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.

Method: Uses conditional probability distributions, focusing on token-level entropy under approximated task conditioning (ATC).

Result: ATC outperforms benchmarks, generalizes across languages (Python, CPP, Java), and is practical for real-world use.

Conclusion: Task-level conditioning is crucial for detecting LLM-generated code; ATC is a novel, effective solution.

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

*Qinyue Zheng,Salman Abdullah,Sam Rawal,Cyril Zakka,Sophie Ostmeier,Maximilian Purk,Eduardo Reis,Eric J. Topol,Jure Leskovec,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRIAD introduces a curated corpus of medical QA pairs to improve LLM accuracy and reduce hallucinations in healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate inaccurate medical content, and existing RAG pipelines use noisy, unstructured text, lacking systematic organization.

Method: MIRIAD creates 5.8M QA pairs from peer-reviewed literature via LLM generation, filtering, grounding, and human annotation.

Result: MIRIAD improves LLM accuracy by 6.7% and hallucination detection by 22.5-37% (F1 score) over unstructured RAG baselines.

Conclusion: MIRIAD enables reliable LLM applications in healthcare through structured, retrievable medical knowledge.

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

### [135] [Reinforcing Code Generation: Improving Text-to-SQL with Execution-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06093)
*Atharv Kulkarni,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution-based feedback to improve SQL query generation from natural language, achieving significant accuracy gains without supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if a large language model (LLM) can be tuned for SQL generation by interacting with a database engine, avoiding reliance on text-code pairs.

Method: Frames the problem as RL, using execution-based feedback (scalar rewards) and the GRPO framework. Evaluated on a tabular reasoning benchmark.

Result: RL-tuning improved SQL accuracy from 31.49 to 49.83 and reduced errors from 25.43% to 14.71%, nearly matching a larger model's performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates execution-based feedback's potential to enhance LLMs' symbolic reasoning, offering an alternative to supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

*Benedetta Muscato,Yue Li,Gizem Gezici,Zhixue Zhao,Fosca Giannotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can capture multiple perspectives in subjective NLP tasks like hate speech detection, but few-shot setups struggle to reflect full human disagreement. Prompt design and demonstration selection are key, while example ordering has little impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can model human disagreement and multiple perspectives in subjective tasks, addressing the limitations of aggregated labels.

Method: Uses in-context learning (ICL) in zero-shot and few-shot settings with four open-source LLMs, testing three label modeling strategies and various demonstration selection methods.

Result: Multi-perspective generation works in zero-shot, but few-shot setups often miss the full range of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection significantly influence performance.

Conclusion: Modeling subjectivity with LLMs is challenging, emphasizing the need for perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a phonetic correction system to improve ASR accuracy for underrepresented movie titles, achieving a 4.4-7.6% relative reduction in word error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality ASR training data is costly, and underrepresented movie titles suffer poor recognition.

Method: Uses phonetic search to generate alternatives and a rescorer to select the best output.

Result: Improves word error rate by 4.4-7.6% relative to baselines.

Conclusion: The phonetic correction system effectively enhances ASR performance for underrepresented terms.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CONFER, a dataset to evaluate NLI models' handling of conditional sentences, revealing their struggles with presuppositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore NLI models' ability to handle fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals, which remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces CONFER dataset and evaluates four NLI models and LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, DeepSeek-R1) in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Result: NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in conditionals; fine-tuning on existing datasets doesn't improve performance.

Conclusion: Current NLI models lack robustness in handling conditional presuppositions, highlighting a gap for future research.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A library called semantic-features is introduced to study contextualized word embeddings by projecting them into interpretable spaces. It's tested on dative constructions, showing models' sensitivity to semantic interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an easy-to-use tool for analyzing contextualized word embeddings and explore how dative constructions influence semantic interpretations in language models.

Method: The semantic-features library is applied to a dataset of 450 sentence pairs with ambiguous recipients, testing models' interpretations of animate vs. inanimate referents.

Result: Three masked language models demonstrated expected sensitivities to the semantic interpretations of dative constructions.

Conclusion: The tool is effective and promising for studying contextualized embeddings and their semantic implications.

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

### [140] [Does It Run and Is That Enough? Revisiting Text-to-Chart Generation with a Multi-Agent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06175)
*James Ford,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent pipeline reduces execution errors in chart-generating code from 15% to 4.5%, but issues like hallucinations and accessibility remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent execution errors in chart-generation tasks, despite fine-tuning, suggest a need for alternative approaches.

Method: Proposed a lightweight multi-agent pipeline (drafting, execution, repair, judgment) using GPT-4o-mini.

Result: Reduced errors to 4.5% on Text2Chart31 and 4.6% on ChartX, but identified hallucinations and poor accessibility.

Conclusion: Future work should prioritize chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and accessibility over execution reliability.

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning Llama3 with VP evaluation criteria in prompts outperforms CoT technique, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4 in VP detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve voice phishing (VP) detection using small LMs by incorporating expert knowledge and evaluating robustness under adversarial conditions.

Method: Fine-tuned Llama3 with VP evaluation criteria in prompts, applied CoT, and tested on an adversarial dataset. Also created VP transcripts for training.

Result: Llama3-8B with VP criteria in prompts performed best among small LMs, matching GPT-4's VP detection.

Conclusion: Expert knowledge in prompts is more effective than CoT for small LMs in VP detection.

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

TL;DR: PuzzleWorld is a benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems to test open-ended, multimodal reasoning in models, revealing current models' poor performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve foundation models' ability in open-ended, creative reasoning, mirroring real-world problem-solving like scientific discovery.

Method: Introduces PuzzleWorld, a benchmark with annotated puzzles (solutions, reasoning traces, skill labels) for holistic evaluation and fine-tuning analysis.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly (1-14% accuracy), but fine-tuning on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%.

Conclusion: Current models struggle with open-ended reasoning; PuzzleWorld provides a tool for advancing general, creative reasoning systems.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Result: Identifies gaps in physical intuition and reliability, proposing future LLMs for physics with enhanced capabilities.

Conclusion: Collaboration between physics and AI communities is needed to address challenges and advance scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains,

position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate
theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with

-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps
in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We
envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting sexism online, proposing two prompt-based data augmentation techniques and an ensemble strategy to improve model performance on the EDOS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sexism detection in online content is difficult due to data sparsity, class imbalance, and nuanced language. Existing systems struggle with generalization and annotator disagreement.

Method: Proposes Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA) and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE) for data augmentation, and an ensemble strategy for fine-grained classification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EDOS dataset, with macro F1 improvements of 1.5 points for binary classification and 4.1 points for fine-grained classification.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively address data sparsity and nuanced language challenges, enhancing sexism detection performance.

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

*Yi Sui,Chaozhuo Li,Chen Zhang,Dawei song,Qiuchi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSSP-RAG is a dual-stream framework that improves RAG by resolving conflicts between external and parametric knowledge in LLMs, using mixed-attention and unsupervised hallucination detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle with knowledge conflicts in LLMs, leading to degraded performance.

Method: Proposes DSSP-RAG with mixed-attention for shared-private semantic synergy, unsupervised hallucination detection, and EQ-based noise reduction.

Result: DSSP-RAG outperforms baselines by effectively resolving conflicts and enhancing knowledge complementarity.

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG improves RAG performance by better integrating and resolving conflicts between internal and external knowledge.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

### [147] [Cartridges: Lightweight and general-purpose long context representations via self-study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06266)
*Sabri Eyuboglu,Ryan Ehrlich,Simran Arora,Neel Guha,Dylan Zinsley,Emily Liu,Will Tennien,Atri Rudra,James Zou,Azalia Mirhoseini,Christopher Re*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Cartridge,' a smaller KV cache trained offline on a corpus, to replace costly in-context learning (ICL) for large language models. Self-study, a training method using synthetic conversations, improves performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for grounding queries in large corpora using ICL are memory-intensive and costly. The goal is to reduce memory consumption and improve efficiency while maintaining performance.

Method: Train a smaller KV cache (Cartridge) offline using self-study, a method involving synthetic conversations and context-distillation. Compare performance and efficiency with ICL.

Result: Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. They also extend effective context length and allow composition without retraining.

Conclusion: Self-study-trained Cartridges offer a cost-effective, efficient alternative to ICL, maintaining performance and enabling new capabilities like context extension and composition.

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

*Mukur Gupta,Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Nicholas Deas,Melanie Subbiah,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdvSumm is a training framework to reduce bias in text summarization by using adversarial perturbations, improving robustness without losing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often inherit biases from pre-training data, leading to unfair outputs in summarization tasks.

Method: AdvSumm introduces a Perturber component for gradient-guided embedding perturbations in Seq2Seq models.

Result: AdvSumm reduces name-nationality and political framing biases better than standard transformers and data augmentation.

Conclusion: AdvSumm effectively mitigates bias in summarization while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

### [149] [Can ChatGPT Perform Image Splicing Detection? A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05358)
*Souradip Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4V demonstrates strong zero-shot performance (85% accuracy) in detecting image splicing, with Chain-of-Thought prompting being most effective. It leverages both visual artifacts and contextual knowledge, though it falls short of specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GPT-4V's out-of-the-box capabilities in image forensics, specifically for detecting image splicing manipulations, without task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4V using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting on a subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy in zero-shot settings, with CoT prompting providing the best balance. The model uses visual and contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: GPT-4V shows promise as a flexible tool in image forensics due to its generalizability and interpretability, despite not matching specialized models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CO$_2$ emissions are critical for environmental and industrial monitoring, especially in livestock management. Existing methods lack robustness for diverse applications, prompting the need for an advanced framework.

Method: The approach combines a multi-scale context aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components. Two datasets (CCR and RTA) are introduced for evaluation. A lightweight variant, CarboFormer, is also proposed.

Conclusion: The framework advances CO$_2$ emission analysis, offering robust tools for environmental sensing and precision livestock management, with potential for real-time applications on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STFlow, a flow matching generative model, improves spatial transcriptomics prediction by modeling cell-cell interactions and addressing memory constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of low throughput and specialized facilities in spatial transcriptomics by predicting ST from histology images, while addressing issues of independent spot prediction and memory constraints.

Method: Proposes STFlow, a flow matching generative model that models joint gene expression distribution and uses an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention.

Result: STFlow achieves over 18% relative improvement on HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: STFlow effectively addresses key limitations in spatial transcriptomics prediction, offering a scalable and accurate solution.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a seed selection method for diffusion-based scalable image coding to improve quality without extra bitrate, using intermediate outputs for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either require extra bitrate for scalability or use a single random seed, leading to suboptimal image quality.

Method: Selects the optimal seed from multiple candidates based on early reverse diffusion outputs to enhance quality and reduce computational cost.

Result: Outperforms the baseline in multiple metrics without increasing bitrate.

Conclusion: The proposed seed selection method effectively improves image quality in scalable coding for humans and machines.

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based method for generating stereo images from text prompts, leveraging Stable Diffusion and fine-tuning with stereo datasets and reward functions for improved consistency and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo image datasets with large baselines are scarce, making training a diffusion model from scratch impractical.

Method: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on stereo datasets, enhance with prompt alignment and stereo consistency reward functions.

Result: Generates high-quality stereo images, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts diffusion models for stereo image generation, achieving superior results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Result: The proposed method effectively detects forged content, aiding forensic efforts in identifying criminal activities.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical solution for detecting counterfeit media, supporting forensic and misinformation mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the

Conclusion: Computer vision enables UAV autonomy, improving efficiency in critical applications.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense

Motivation: Ensuring fairness and generalization in face authentication across diverse demographic groups is a challenge.

Method: Combined pre-trained ViT and ResNet features, trained on custom datasets, and tested with a few-shot prototype network on demographic-specific datasets.

Result: Microsoft Swin Transformer outperformed other ViT models; performance improved with larger support sets.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for fair face authentication, with code and data made available for further research.

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and

Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches treat quality scoring and reasoning as separate tasks, creating a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. The goal is to unify these tasks for mutual reinforcement.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) cold-start stage with expert-designed prompts and cross-entropy loss, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for joint optimization.

Result: Q-Ponder achieves 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets and outperforms description-based SOTA models in accuracy and reasonableness.

Conclusion: The unified framework enhances both scoring accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating generalization potential across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

*Mert Can Cakmak,Nitin Agarwal,Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriPSS is a tri-modal framework for keyframe extraction, combining color, structural, and semantic cues via PCA and HDBSCAN clustering, achieving state-of-the-art results on TVSum20 and SumMe datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient keyframe extraction is challenging due to the complexity of video content, necessitating a multi-modal approach.

Method: TriPSS integrates CIELAB color features, ResNet-50 embeddings, and Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct captions, fused via PCA and clustered with HDBSCAN, followed by refinement.

Result: TriPSS outperforms traditional unimodal and prior multi-modal methods on TVSum20 and SumMe datasets.

Conclusion: TriPSS sets a new benchmark for video content understanding by effectively capturing nuanced visual and semantic information.

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

*Luka Vetoshkin,Dmitry Yudin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2SAM integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of complex objects, outperforming SAM-HQ with significant IoU improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, leading to poor quality for complex objects.

Method: Uses CLIP-based embeddings from text prompts, projected into DINO feature space, to enhance SAM-HQ's segmentation.

Result: Achieves up to +5.9% IoU and +8.3% boundary IoU improvements on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Natural language guidance is effective for precise segmentation, especially where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based

attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency and computational overhead in VLMs hinder real-time autonomous driving applications, especially due to over-inference.

Method: Proposes AD-EE, an Early Exit framework using domain-specific characteristics and causal inference to identify optimal exit layers.

Result: Tested on Waymo, CODA, and a real vehicle, AD-EE reduces latency by up to 57.58% and boosts detection accuracy by up to 44%.

Conclusion: AD-EE effectively addresses inefficiency in VLMs, enhancing real-time performance and accuracy in autonomous driving.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a VLM-based visual reasoning approach for anomaly detection in robot scientific labs, showing improved accuracy with more contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual anomaly detection is crucial for stability and safety in scientific workflows, prompting the need for an adaptable solution.

Method: A VLM-based visual reasoning approach with four progressively informative prompt configurations is introduced and tested on a tailored benchmark.

Result: Detection accuracy improves with more contextual information, and real-world validations confirm effectiveness in identifying process-level anomalies.

Conclusion: The work provides a data-driven foundation and evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific workflows.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment

### [167] [Object-level Self-Distillation for Vision Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05409)
*Çağlar Hızlı,Çağatay Yıldız,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS improves vision pretraining by shifting self-distillation from images to individual objects, enhancing representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining assumes single-object images, limiting scalability to complex scenes. ODIS addresses this by focusing on object-level learning.

Method: ODIS uses object-aware cropping and masked attention to isolate objects, simplifying scene-level tasks into object-level sub-tasks.

Result: Achieves 82.6% k-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large, demonstrating improved visual representations.

Conclusion: ODIS effectively enhances pretraining by leveraging object-level granularity, outperforming image-level methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

*Zory Zhang,Pinyuan Feng,Bingyang Wang,Tianwei Zhao,Suyang Yu,Qingying Gao,Hokin Deng,Ziqiao Ma,Yijiang Li,Dezhi Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Most VLMs perform poorly at gaze-referential inference, unlike humans, but top-tier VLMs show some capability, suggesting potential for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer gaze-referential information, a key component of human-AI interaction.

Method: Controlled study with 111 VLMs and 65 humans, using manipulated photos and mixed-effects models for analysis.

Result: 94 VLMs failed to outperform random guessing, while humans excelled. Top-tier VLMs showed declining performance with difficulty but robustness to perceptual variations.

Conclusion: VLMs lack natural gaze inference capability, but top-tier models hint at potential for future development.

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench is the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with spatial audio, and SAVVY is a training-free pipeline to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AV-LLMs and benchmarks focus on static or 2D scenes, leaving 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic environments unexplored.

Method: SAVVY uses a two-stage pipeline: Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation and Dynamic Global Map Construction.

Result: SAVVY improves state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard for dynamic 3D spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench and SAVVY advance the field by addressing dynamic 3D spatial reasoning, enhancing AV-LLM capabilities.

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open HDF5-based format for CAD B-rep data, replacing STEP to enable broader use in learning pipelines without costly licenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD datasets use STEP format, requiring expensive CAD kernels, limiting scalability and deployment in learning pipelines.

Method: Proposed an HDF5-based format and open-source library for processing CAD data, with standard functionalities like sampling and curvature.

Result: Converted Fusion 360 and ABC datasets, validated data integrity via four use cases (normal estimation, denoising, etc.).

Conclusion: The HDF5 format and tools enable scalable, cost-effective use of CAD data in machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

TL;DR: SPD improves vision-based RL by extracting task-relevant features from images with distractions, using weak and strong augmentations to predict transitions, outperforming prior methods in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of task-irrelevant distractions (e.g., shadows, clouds) in vision-based RL, especially when unseen during training.

Method: Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) uses weak and strong augmentations to predict inverse and forward transitions, learning robust representations.

Result: SPD outperforms previous methods in MuJoCo and CARLA tasks, showing strong generalization to unseen observations.

Conclusion: SPD effectively extracts task-relevant features, enhancing robustness and generalization in vision-based RL.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure of MBRL algorithms in handling visual distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows) in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Dr. G with dual contrastive learning for feature extraction and a recurrent state inverse dynamics model for temporal understanding.

Result: Achieves 117% and 14% performance improvements in the DeepMind Control suite and Robosuite, respectively.

Conclusion: Dr. G enhances MBRL robustness against visual distractions, demonstrating strong generalization in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

TL;DR: A lightweight one-stage MPPE model using raw RF signals with sub-grouping and multi-head attention outperforms previous methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy. A new SSL method further enhances performance in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RF-based MPPE methods are either computationally intensive or lack accuracy. The paper aims to address these limitations by proposing a simpler yet more effective approach.

Method: Sub-groups RF signals, processes them with a shared single-layer CNN and multi-head attention, and introduces a self-supervised learning method for masked data prediction.

Result: Improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15% (PCKh@0.5) and shows better generalization in new locations or obstructed scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed model and SSL method offer a more efficient and accurate solution for RF-based MPPE, with open-source code and dataset available.

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

TL;DR: SIV-Bench is a new video benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on social interaction tasks, revealing strengths in Social Scene Understanding but weaknesses in Social State Reasoning and Social Dynamics Prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating AI in understanding complex human social interactions, which involve multimodal cues, mental states, and dynamic behaviors.

Method: Introduces SIV-Bench with 2,792 video clips and 8,792 QA pairs from TikTok/YouTube, covering diverse genres and cultural backgrounds. Tests MLLMs on SSU, SSR, and SDP, analyzing textual cues' impact.

Result: MLLMs excel in SSU but struggle with SSR and SDP, especially Relation Inference. Transcribed dialogue aids comprehension.

Conclusion: SIV-Bench highlights MLLMs' limitations and strengths, guiding future AI development for social intelligence.

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

TL;DR: A surrogate model generates joint adversarial perturbations for vision-language models, outperforming existing attacks and compromising state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models lack robustness against perturbations in both vision and language modalities, necessitating evaluation of their inter-modal dependencies.

Method: Train a surrogate model to generate joint adversarial perturbations for images and text, evaluated on visual question answering and reasoning datasets.

Result: The proposed strategy outperforms multi-modal and single-modality attacks, effectively compromising models like instruct-BLIP and ViLT.

Conclusion: The surrogate model demonstrates superior adversarial performance, highlighting vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning method is proposed to evaluate video classification robustness by targeting sensitive spatial and temporal regions with minimal perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video classification models are more complex and costly than image-based ones, requiring minimal perturbations for effective robustness evaluation.

Method: Uses spatial and temporal multi-agent reinforcement learning to generate fine, coherent perturbations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on Lp metric and average queries, with custom distortion types for relevance.

Conclusion: The method effectively evaluates robustness on popular video action recognition models and datasets (HMDB-51, UCF-101).

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

*Sho Takishita,Jay Gala,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Kentaro Inui,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-based VLMs compensate for weak visual features with strong language backbones, enabling dynamic division of labor between vision and language components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language backbones in VLMs compensate for limitations in CLIP-based vision encoders.

Method: Controlled self-attention ablations on three CLIP-based VLMs using a probing task.

Result: CLIP visual representations provide semantic info, but language decoders can compensate for weak visuals, recovering performance.

Conclusion: Future VLMs could offload more visual processing to language decoders, leveraging their compensatory capabilities.

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

*Ludovic Arnould,Salim Khazem,Hugues Ali Mehenni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation method for Visual Language Models (VLMs) using synthetic images to systematically test and analyze their perception capabilities, addressing limitations of current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks are costly, prone to information leakage, and lack clarity on failure causes (perception, reasoning, or knowledge). The authors aim to provide a more controlled and interpretable assessment.

Method: The proposed method uses procedurally generated synthetic images with controlled variations (e.g., object counts) to isolate and test specific VLM capabilities, enabling fine-grained failure analysis.

Result: The approach allows systematic stress testing and targeted assessment of VLMs, revealing precise perception failures and shifting focus from coarse benchmarks to interpretable evaluations.

Conclusion: The synthetic image-based diagnostic method offers a more efficient and insightful way to evaluate VLMs, addressing key limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

*Hao Jiang,Chuan Hu,Yukang Shi,Yuan He,Ke Wang,Xi Zhang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NuScenes-S, a structured benchmark dataset, and FastDrive, a compact VLM for autonomous driving, improving accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging gaps between VLMs and real-world autonomous driving by addressing dataset redundancy and computational inefficiency.

Method: Developed NuScenes-S (structured dataset) and FastDrive (0.9B-parameter VLM) for efficient, machine-friendly autonomous driving.

Result: FastDrive improves decision-making accuracy by 20% and achieves 10x speedup over larger VLMs.

Conclusion: Structured datasets and compact VLMs enhance autonomous driving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: Mode normalization improves convergence speed and stability in SAR image segmentation for U-Net and SegNet models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for SAR image segmentation face challenges in convergence and stability due to complex data distributions.

Method: Integration of mode normalization into U-Net and SegNet to reduce convergence time while maintaining performance.

Result: Mode normalization accelerates convergence and increases model stability across different zones.

Conclusion: Normalization enhances computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to classify and restore degraded images into four categories, improving visual quality through targeted restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image degradation affects visual quality and downstream tasks, necessitating an automated solution for classification and restoration.

Method: The VLM classifies images into four degradation types (A-D), followed by targeted restoration using dedicated models for each type.

Result: The approach accurately classifies degradations and enhances image quality using specialized restoration models.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, automated solution for image enhancement by combining VLMs with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR is a novel method for detecting and localizing image manipulations, especially those made by diffusion models, using multimodal features and contrastive loss. It outperforms existing methods and is evaluated on a new benchmark, BBC-PAIR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of high-quality image manipulation tools, especially diffusion models, necessitates reliable methods to detect and localize such edits to combat misuse.

Method: RADAR leverages foundation models, combines features from different image modalities, and uses an auxiliary contrastive loss to isolate manipulated patches.

Result: RADAR significantly improves accuracy and generalizes well across 28 diffusion models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RADAR is an effective solution for detecting and localizing image edits, with potential for broad application due to its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,
data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2GO introduces a query-based 3D representation for occupancy prediction, outperforming dense methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense 3D representations are slow and inflexible for dynamic driving scenes, prompting a need for efficient alternatives.

Method: Uses compact 3D queries propagated over time, decoded into semantic Gaussians, and employs a denoising rendering objective.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and KITTI, with 1.5 IoU improvement and 5.9x faster inference.

Conclusion: Query-based representations like S2GO offer superior efficiency and accuracy for 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale benchmark dataset for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR), featuring 5,300 pixel-aligned image pairs, and validates its utility by training a U-Net model with five evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reflection removal methods lack large-scale, high-quality datasets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: A U-Net-based model is trained on the new dataset, evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE metrics.

Result: The dataset and model are validated, showing practical performance improvements in reflection removal.

Conclusion: The dataset and code will be publicly released to support future research in reflection removal.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how top-down information influences visual processing and to bridge human cognition with computer vision.

Method: A dual-network model: one for basic tasks, the other for contextual guidance via attention.

Result: The model's attention patterns resemble human spatial and feature-based attention.

Conclusion: Neural networks can effectively model human visual attention, offering insights into cognition.

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

*Mary Aiyetigbo,Wanqi Yuan,Feng Luo,Nianyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VR-INR is a video restoration method using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that generalizes to unseen super-resolution scales and performs zero-shot denoising, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video restoration methods lack flexibility for arbitrary scales or degradations beyond their training. VR-INR aims to address this limitation.

Method: VR-INR uses a hierarchical spatial-temporal-texture encoding with multi-resolution implicit hash encoding to adaptively decode high-resolution frames from low-resolution inputs.

Result: VR-INR maintains high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in sharpness, detail preservation, and denoising.

Conclusion: VR-INR demonstrates superior generalization and performance in video restoration, even for untrained scales and noise conditions.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces F2T2-HiT, a Transformer-based architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR), combining FFT and Hierarchical Transformers to handle varied reflections effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflections degrade image quality, and existing methods struggle with their complexity and variability in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes a U-shaped F2T2-HiT architecture integrating FFT Transformer blocks for global frequency domain analysis and Hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

Conclusion: The F2T2-HiT architecture effectively addresses SIRR challenges, demonstrating superior performance in reflection removal.

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: FocusDiff improves fine-grained text-image alignment by focusing on subtle differences in paired prompts, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive and diffusion models struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment, limiting precise control over visual tokens.

Method: Proposes FocusDiff, using a new dataset of paired texts/images and a reinforcement learning algorithm to emphasize fine-grained semantic differences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on the PairComp benchmark.

Conclusion: FocusDiff effectively addresses fine-grained alignment issues, enabling more precise control in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

TL;DR: MORSE-500 is a new video benchmark addressing gaps in current multimodal reasoning benchmarks by focusing on temporal complexity, diverse reasoning skills, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack temporal dynamics, diverse reasoning skills, and scalability, limiting progress in multimodal intelligence.

Method: MORSE-500 includes 500 scripted video clips with embedded questions across six reasoning categories, generated using Python scripts, generative models, and real footage.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps, especially in abstract and planning tasks.

Conclusion: MORSE-500 provides a scalable, evolving benchmark for stress-testing and advancing multimodal reasoning research.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

TL;DR: YoursProtoP introduces an interactive strategy to personalize prototypical parts in neural networks, improving concept consistency and user alignment without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept-based interpretable models suffer from concept inconsistency and lack user feedback mechanisms, misaligning model reasoning with human understanding.

Method: YoursProtoP adapts and splits visual concepts via user supervision, aligning them with user preferences.

Result: Experiments on FunnyBirds, CUB, CARS, and PETS datasets show YoursProtoP achieves concept consistency while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: YoursProtoP effectively bridges the gap between model explanations and user understanding through personalized concepts.

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

TL;DR: FRAME is a self-supervised video frame encoder designed for dense video understanding, outperforming image encoders and existing video models on dense prediction tasks while maintaining a compact architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches (e.g., DINO, CLIP, VideoMAE) lack temporal awareness or underperform on dense prediction tasks, creating a need for a specialized video encoder.

Method: FRAME predicts current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, ensuring spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. It also aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space for language-driven tasks.

Result: FRAME outperforms image encoders and self-supervised video models across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets.

Conclusion: FRAME bridges the gap in dense video understanding, offering superior performance and versatility for downstream applications.

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

TL;DR: The paper explores improving 3D dynamic segmentation by fusing 2D motion predictions into layered radiance fields, addressing challenges with test-time refinement to outperform 2D baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D techniques often fail for dynamic phenomena, despite their success in static scenes. The paper aims to enhance 3D dynamic segmentation by leveraging 2D motion cues.

Method: Proposes Layered Motion Fusion to integrate 2D motion segmentation into 3D layered radiance fields, using test-time refinement to manage complexity.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms 2D baselines, showing 3D techniques can enhance dynamic scene analysis.

Conclusion: 3D methods can effectively improve 2D analysis even for dynamic scenes, demonstrated through motion fusion and refinement.

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

### [193] [When Semantics Mislead Vision: Mitigating Large Multimodal Models Hallucinations in Scene Text Spotting and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05551)
*Yan Shu,Hangui Lin,Yexin Liu,Yan Zhang,Gangyan Zeng,Yan Li,Yu Zhou,Ser-Nam Lim,Harry Yang,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic hallucination in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when handling ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, proposing a training-free framework to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, often producing incorrect but plausible answers (semantic hallucination).

Method: Proposes ZoomText for text region identification and Grounded Layer Correction to guide decoding using less hallucination-prone layers.

Result: The method effectively reduces semantic hallucination and performs well on scene text benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework mitigates hallucinations without training and maintains semantic accuracy for meaningful text.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

*Tao Hu,Haoyang Peng,Xiao Liu,Yuewen Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EX-4D introduces a Depth Watertight Mesh representation and simulated masking to generate high-quality, camera-controllable videos from monocular input, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in extreme viewpoints, degrading visual quality.

Method: EX-4D uses a Depth Watertight Mesh for geometric consistency and a simulated masking strategy for training data. A LoRA-based video diffusion adapter synthesizes high-quality videos.

Result: EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in physical consistency and extreme-view quality.

Conclusion: EX-4D enables practical 4D video generation with improved geometric and visual quality.

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

*Andreas Meuleman,Ishaan Shah,Alexandre Lanvin,Bernhard Kerbl,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast on-the-fly method for camera pose estimation and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) training, handling large scenes and wide baselines efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the slow computation of pose estimation and 3DGS optimization, and the limitations of SLAM methods with wide baselines and large scenes.

Method: Fast initial pose estimation with learned features and GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment, direct sampling of Gaussian primitives, and scalable radiance field construction with clustering.

Result: On-the-fly processing of diverse capture scenarios and scene sizes, competitive in speed and image quality.

Conclusion: The method efficiently handles large-scale scenes and wide baselines, providing immediate results post-capture.

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

TL;DR: VoxelSplat is a novel regularization framework for camera-based occupancy prediction, enhancing 3D semantics and scene flow learning through 2D projection and self-supervised motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like occlusions and unbalanced dynamic environments in 3D semantics and scene flow prediction.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for enhanced semantics supervision via 2D projection and self-supervised scene flow learning.

Result: Improves accuracy of semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation without increasing inference time.

Conclusion: VoxelSplat effectively integrates into existing models, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCrafter is a 3D generative model that synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful 3D meshes from a single RGB image using a unified, compositional architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either produce monolithic shapes or rely on segmented inputs, limiting flexibility and realism. PartCrafter aims to enable part-aware generation without pre-segmentation.

Method: It uses a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) with two innovations: a compositional latent space for disentangled part representation and a hierarchical attention mechanism for structured generation.

Result: PartCrafter outperforms existing methods in generating decomposable 3D meshes, even for parts not visible in input images.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding and synthesis, with code and data to be released.

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniRes, a diffusion-based framework, addresses complex image degradations by combining specialized models, achieving strong performance on in-the-wild data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image restoration faces challenges due to diverse degradations, and existing methods struggle with generalization to in-the-wild data.

Method: Proposes UniRes, a flexible diffusion-based framework that integrates specialized models during diffusion sampling for end-to-end restoration of complex degradations.

Result: Outperforms on complex and single-degradation datasets, showing consistent gains, especially for complex degradations.

Conclusion: UniRes effectively handles complex degradations with flexibility and strong performance, requiring only isolated training data.

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

*Shuchen Lin,Mingtao Feng,Weisheng Dong,Fangfang Wu,Jianqiao Luo,Yaonan Wang,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve Real-SR by addressing task imbalance in multi-task learning, introducing a novel task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-SR is challenging due to complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images, and existing methods lack balance in handling diverse degradation patterns.

Method: The approach frames Real-SR as a multi-task learning problem, segments the degradation space, uses a focal loss for imbalance quantification, and employs adaptive data rebalancing.

Result: The method achieves consistent superiority across all degradation tasks in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm effectively balances degradation tasks in Real-SR, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative visual grounding framework using LLMs for open-world visual relationship detection, outperforming baselines on unseen predicates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of fixed predicate sets in VRD models by leveraging LLMs for generalization to novel interactions.

Method: An EM-inspired framework alternating between LLM-generated scene graphs and visual model training for alignment.

Result: Achieves mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on seen, unseen, and mixed predicate sets, respectively.

Conclusion: Grounded LLM priors show promise for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

TL;DR: ADR-MVS improves 3D urban reconstruction from aerial images by integrating monocular geometric cues and adaptive depth range prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS methods fail to address key differences in aerial vs. close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges and poor feature-matching in low-detailed images.

Method: ADR-MVS uses a depth range predictor with cross-attention discrepancy learning, adaptive range maps, and normal-guided cost aggregation for precise depth regression.

Result: ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and München datasets with superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: ADR-MVS effectively addresses aerial image challenges, enhancing depth estimation accuracy and computational performance.

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracranial tissues in brain MRI are underutilized for health characterization, lacking validated tools for diverse populations and pathologies.

Method: TissUnet was trained on 155 MRI-CT pairs and validated across nine datasets, including healthy and tumor cases, using Dice coefficients and expert annotations.

Result: TissUnet achieved median Dice coefficients of 0.79-0.83, outperforming prior methods, with 89% acceptance in adjudication and excellent performance in blinded reviews.

Conclusion: TissUnet provides fast, accurate extracranial tissue segmentation, enabling large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology and health risks using standard MRI.

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial

Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and human-aligned evaluation, limiting VLA model development.

Method: DriveAction introduces 16,185 QA pairs from 2,610 driving scenarios, using real-world data and an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework.

Result: VLMs need both vision and language inputs for accurate action prediction; accuracy drops significantly without either.

Conclusion: DriveAction provides a rigorous foundation for improving human-like decisions in autonomous driving by identifying model bottlenecks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Motivation: Effectively representing 3D scenes for MLLMs is challenging, as existing methods rely on 2D features and varied tokenization.

Method: The work compares video-based and point-based 3D token structures, introducing a novel approach with 3D point cloud features from a pretrained encoder.

Result: Merging 3D features improves performance, and point-based structures can rival video-based ones with clever sampling. State-of-the-art results are achieved on 3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: The analysis of token structures and transparent reporting of results are key contributions, vital for robust progress in 3D understanding.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

TL;DR: MoralCLIP extends vision-language models with moral reasoning using Moral Foundations Theory, improving moral content understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models lack moral reasoning, a key aspect of human cognition.

Method: MoralCLIP integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, using a moral data augmentation strategy and a dataset of 15,000 image-text pairs.

Result: Explicit moral supervision enhances unimodal and multimodal moral understanding.

Conclusion: MoralCLIP lays groundwork for morally-aware AI systems aligned with human values.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a many-to-many Token Transforming framework for compressing vision transformers, unifying existing token reduction methods and minimizing information loss without post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token reduction methods (pruning or merging) cause significant information loss and require post-training, motivating a more efficient and training-free approach.

Method: The authors introduce a token matrix transformation framework, generalizing existing methods, and propose a many-to-many Token Transforming approach to preserve information.

Result: Experiments show 40% FLOP reduction, 1.5x speedup for DeiT-S with only 0.1% accuracy drop, and consistent improvements in dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The framework offers superior computation-performance trade-offs, budget reduction, and inference acceleration across various vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

Method: YOEO uses a unified network for instance segmentation and NPCS representation, combining semantic labels, centroid offsets, and clustering for pose recovery.

Result: Experiments on GAPart dataset and real-world deployment show YOEO's effectiveness, achieving real-time feedback at 200Hz.

Conclusion: YOEO offers a practical, efficient solution for real-time robotic manipulation tasks with articulated objects.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

### [208] [Investigating the Relationship between Weighted Figure of Merit and Rosin's Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05749)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the relationship between weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure for polygonal approximation, concluding they are independent and not substitutable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if weighted figure of merit can replace Rosin's measure for comparing sub-optimal polygonal approximation schemes.

Method: Theoretical analysis, experimental investigation, and statistical analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient) using public datasets.

Result: The two measures are theoretically independent, experimentally uncorrelated, and cannot substitute each other.

Conclusion: Weighted figure of merit cannot replace Rosin's measure for evaluating sub-optimal schemes.

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets, generalizing to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The method is effective for 3D trajectory estimation, even when trained on simulated data, with broad applications.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking
sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an
LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is
independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of
intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection
consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets
and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite
training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art

### [210] [Do Large Vision-Language Models Distinguish between the Actual and Apparent Features of Illusions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05765)
*Taiga Shinozaki,Tomoki Doi,Satoshi Nishida,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large vision language models (LVLMs) can distinguish genuine from fake visual illusions using a new VQA dataset. Results suggest LVLMs rely on prior knowledge, not genuine visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguities in assessing machine cognition of visual illusions by distinguishing actual and apparent features.

Method: Introduces a VQA dataset with genuine and fake illusions, evaluates LVLMs' performance on distinguishing them.

Result: LVLMs predict similar answers for both genuine and fake illusions, indicating reliance on prior knowledge.

Conclusion: LVLMs lack genuine visual understanding of illusions, relying instead on learned patterns.

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

*Meng Fan,Yifan Zuo,Patrick Blaes,Harley Montgomery,Subhasis Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel, model-agnostic approach addresses sensor staleness in autonomous vehicles by using timestamp offsets and data augmentation, improving performance under stale conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor staleness in autonomous vehicles causes temporal misalignment, degrading trajectory predictions critical for safety.

Method: Uses per-point timestamp offsets for LiDAR/radar relative to cameras and data augmentation to simulate realistic staleness patterns. Integrated into a perspective-view detection model.

Result: Conventional models regress under stale conditions, while the proposed method maintains consistent performance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates sensor staleness, enhancing robustness in perception systems.

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Conclusion: GazeNLQ effectively utilizes gaze data to enhance video retrieval performance, with code publicly available.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)
Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's
perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that
reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and
cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which
leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves
R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is

TL;DR: A novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework using diffusion models addresses computational demands for real-time interactive avatars, achieving high FPS and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are expressive but computationally heavy, limiting real-time avatar applications. The paper aims to overcome this for interactive use.

Method: Proposes variable-length video generation, consistency model training, quantization, pipeline parallelism, and a new inference strategy for stability. Uses class labels for state transitions and fine-grained facial control.

Result: Achieves 78 FPS at 384x384 and 45 FPS at 512x512, with latencies of 140 ms and 215 ms, enabling real-time, high-fidelity output.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances real-time performance and quality, enhancing interactive avatar applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeformCL introduces a continuous representation for 3D blood vessel extraction using deformable centerlines, improving connectivity, noise robustness, and interaction over discrete methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete representations in 3D medical imaging often lead to fractures or fragments, limiting accuracy in blood vessel extraction.

Method: DeformCL uses deformable centerlines with connected nodes and edges, trained via a cascaded pipeline.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on four 3D vessel segmentation datasets, validated by clinical imaging.

Conclusion: DeformCL offers superior performance and clinical utility, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-scale feature fusion method for UNet-based medical image segmentation, addressing limitations in skip connections by treating them as discrete nodes and using an adaptive ODE method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip connections in UNet lack effective multi-scale feature interaction and rely on inefficient operations, limiting performance despite encoder/decoder improvements.

Method: The method reimagines UNet decoding as solving an initial value problem, using an adaptive ODE approach for multi-scale feature fusion, independent of encoder/decoder design.

Result: Experiments on medical datasets (ACDC, KiTS2023, etc.) show improved feature use, fewer parameters, and maintained high performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances UNet skip connections, offering adaptable and efficient multi-scale feature fusion for medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes a hardware architecture (DIF filter) for noise reduction in event vision, achieving high throughput and performance comparable to state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noise in event vision data streams, which varies with illumination and sensor temperature.

Method: Develops a Distance-based Interpolation with Frequency Weights (DIF) filter, implemented on an FPGA chip, and evaluates it using a new high-resolution event dataset.

Result: Achieves throughputs of 403.39 MEPS (1280x720) and 428.45 MEPS (640x480), with AUROC scores of 0.844-0.999.

Conclusion: The DIF filter offers high throughput and robust performance across noise levels, comparable to existing solutions.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

*Myungkyu Koo,Subin Kim,Sangkyung Kwak,Jaehyun Nam,Seojin Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FontAdapter enables fast, high-quality visual text generation in unseen fonts using a two-stage curriculum learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adapting unseen fonts are slow and impractical for real-time use. FontAdapter addresses this by enabling rapid customization without fine-tuning.

Method: A two-stage curriculum learning approach: first extracts font attributes from glyphs, then integrates styles into natural backgrounds using synthetic datasets.

Result: FontAdapter achieves robust font customization for unseen fonts, supports text editing, style blending, and cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: FontAdapter is a versatile framework for efficient and high-quality font customization tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object

TL;DR: ChronoTailor is a diffusion-based framework for video virtual try-on, ensuring temporal consistency and garment detail preservation using spatio-temporal attention and multi-scale features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video virtual try-on methods struggle with continuity and detail reproduction, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: ChronoTailor employs region-aware spatial guidance, temporal feature fusion, multi-scale garment features, and garment-pose alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms previous methods in maintaining spatio-temporal continuity and preserving garment details.

Conclusion: ChronoTailor advances video virtual try-on by addressing key challenges and introduces the StyleDress dataset for future research.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve consistency and accuracy in diagnosing inhalant allergies by leveraging multiple images under distinct lighting conditions.

Method: A two-part approach: neural network segmentation of wheals, followed by an algorithmic method for detection and delineation, using manually annotated data from 868 patients.

Result: The method, tested on 217 patients, shows higher accuracy with 32 SPAT images compared to a single conventional image.

Conclusion: Utilizing multiple lighting conditions significantly enhances wheal detection accuracy, validating the SPAT device's effectiveness.

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32

wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

### [223] [CryoFastAR: Fast Cryo-EM Ab Initio Reconstruction Made Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05864)
*Jiakai Zhang,Shouchen Zhou,Haizhao Dai,Xinhang Liu,Peihao Wang,Zhiwen Fan,Yuan Pei,Jingyi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CryoFastAR is a geometric foundation model for fast pose estimation in cryo-EM, outperforming traditional iterative methods in speed while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation in cryo-EM is slow due to iterative optimization and challenges like low SNR and CTF distortions. CryoFastAR aims to address this.

Method: Integrates multi-view features and uses progressive training on simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations.

Result: Achieves comparable quality to traditional methods while significantly speeding up inference.

Conclusion: CryoFastAR offers a faster, robust alternative for pose estimation in cryo-EM.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

*Yu Li,Xingyu Qiu,Yuqian Fu,Jie Chen,Tianwen Qian,Xu Zheng,Danda Pani Paudel,Yanwei Fu,Xuanjing Huang,Luc Van Gool,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain-RAG is a training-free framework for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) that uses retrieval-guided compositional image generation to create domain-aligned samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like copy-paste and text-to-image generation struggle with visual realism and domain alignment in CD-FSOD.

Method: Domain-RAG decomposes images into foreground/background, retrieves similar images for guidance, generates domain-aligned backgrounds, and composes them with preserved foregrounds.

Result: Domain-RAG achieves high-quality, domain-consistent samples and outperforms baselines in CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD.

Conclusion: Domain-RAG is effective for CD-FSOD without additional training, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM) is a driving framework with a fast-slow architecture, achieving high performance in the Waymo E2E Driving Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve autonomous driving by combining fast low-level control with slow high-level planning using vision-language models.

Method: Uses selective five-view prompting, multi-stage chain-of-thought prompting, and spline-based trajectory post-processing.

Result: Achieved a Rater Feedback Score of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025 Waymo Challenge, surpassing the baseline by 2.77%.

Conclusion: HMVLM demonstrates effective integration of vision-language models for autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public
baseline by 2.77%.

### [226] [Unleashing the Potential of Consistency Learning for Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05890)
*Yiheng Li,Yang Yang,Zichang Tan,Huan Liu,Weihua Chen,Xu Zhou,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSCL, a method for detecting multi-modal media manipulation by enhancing fine-grained perception of forgery through contextual-semantic consistency learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained consistency analysis, leading to unreliable forgery detection.

Method: CSCL uses two branches (image and text) with CCD and SCD decoders to capture within-modality contextual and across-modality semantic consistency.

Result: CSCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on DGM4 datasets, especially for grounding manipulated content.

Conclusion: CSCL effectively improves forgery detection by leveraging fine-grained consistency learning.

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

*Xin Zhang,Dongdong Meng,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based medical segmentation model using Mask2Former with deformable attention and offset adjustment strategies to improve performance on mid-sized and small organs, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation is challenging, especially for mid-sized and small organs, due to resource demands and unsatisfactory results with existing transformer models.

Method: Combines Mask2Former with deformable attention, offset adjustment strategies, a 4th feature map for organ location, and an FCN-based auxiliary head trained with Dice loss.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on HaNSeg and SegRap2023 datasets, particularly for mid-sized and small organs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of transformer-based models in medical segmentation, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS) to evaluate semi-supervised semantic segmentation models holistically, addressing gaps in current protocols that overlook reliability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for semi-supervised segmentation focus only on accuracy, ignoring reliability and robustness, which are crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose RSS, a novel metric combining accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality via harmonic mean, penalizing deficiencies in any component.

Result: Evaluations show semi-supervised methods often sacrifice reliability for accuracy, with UniMatchV2 demonstrating robustness but still facing reliability issues.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised segmentation research with real-world deployment needs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

*Yixuan Zhu,Haolin Wang,Shilin Ma,Wenliang Zhao,Yansong Tang,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FADE introduces a training-free video editing method using frequency-aware factorization and spectrum-guided modulation to improve temporal coherence and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with efficient editing due to computational demands, and conventional image diffusion models fail to handle video dynamics.

Method: Analyzes attention patterns in pre-trained video diffusion models, proposes factorization for component optimization, and uses spectrum-guided modulation for refined sampling.

Result: Achieves high-quality, realistic, and temporally coherent video edits, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: FADE effectively leverages video priors for efficient and versatile editing without additional training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOGO is an autoregressive framework for real-time 3D motion generation, combining MoSA-VQ for compact motion representation and RQHC-Transformer for efficient token generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving high fidelity, real-time responsiveness, and scalability in transformer-based text-to-motion generation.

Method: Proposes MOGO with MoSA-VQ for hierarchical motion discretization and RQHC-Transformer for single-pass token generation, plus a text condition alignment mechanism.

Result: Achieves competitive/superior generation quality on benchmarks (HumanML3D, KIT-ML, CMP) with improved real-time performance and zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: MOGO successfully balances quality and efficiency, advancing real-time motion generation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dy3DGS-SLAM is a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input, outperforming existing RGB-D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRF or 3DGS-based SLAM methods struggle with dynamic environments, especially with pure RGB input.

Method: Fuses optical flow and depth masks via a probabilistic model, introduces motion loss for pose estimation, and uses rendering loss for mapping.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic scenes, matching or surpassing RGB-D methods.

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM effectively addresses dynamic scene challenges with monocular RGB input, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in agricultural imagery hinder model generalization. DA can bridge these gaps, improving tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection across regions and seasons.

Method: Systematic review of DA methods, categorized into shallow/deep learning and supervised/semi-supervised/unsupervised approaches, with focus on adversarial learning.

Result: DA improves performance in agricultural tasks, especially in dynamic environments. Adversarial learning shows promise, and public datasets are valuable but have limitations.

Conclusion: The review offers a framework for advancing DA in agriculture, identifying research gaps and supporting future improvements in cross-domain image analysis.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCA-Bench, a unified benchmarking suite for evaluating CAPTCHA security across diverse modalities, revealing vulnerabilities and proposing design principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a standardized, large-scale benchmark for assessing CAPTCHA security robustness across different modalities.

Method: MCA-Bench integrates various CAPTCHA types into a single protocol, using a shared vision-language model to fine-tune specialized cracking agents for cross-modal evaluation.

Result: MCA-Bench identifies vulnerabilities in modern CAPTCHAs and provides the first quantitative analysis of challenge complexity, interaction depth, and solvability relationships.

Conclusion: The paper proposes actionable design principles and open challenges to improve CAPTCHA security, benchmarking, and community collaboration.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning vision-and-language models for dynamics models is easier than for world models. Dynamics models can bootstrap world models via synthetic data and inference-time verification, improving action-centric image editing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the capabilities of vision-and-language models in forming realistic world and dynamics models, especially when actions are language-based.

Method: Fine-tune models for dynamics models, then use them to bootstrap world models through synthetic data annotation and inference-time verification with rewards.

Result: The best model outperforms state-of-the-art image editing models by 15% on real-world subsets and achieves top human evaluation scores.

Conclusion: Dynamics models can effectively guide the development of world models, enhancing performance in tasks like action-centric image editing.

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

TL;DR: A hybrid ML and DL approach improves Orthopoxvirus classification from medical images, offering efficiency, scalability, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diagnostic methods are slow and require expertise; limited and biased datasets necessitate automated solutions.

Method: Combines ML models with pretrained DL models for deep feature extraction without data augmentation.

Result: Achieves high classification performance with efficient training and inference, demonstrating generalization across settings.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable and interpretable, suitable for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

TL;DR: A new pipeline for stereo video generation and enhancement, outperforming existing methods on low-resolution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on high-quality monocular videos, neglecting low-quality inputs. The paper aims to address this gap by enhancing and generating stereo videos consistently.

Method: Fine-tuning on degraded data for restoration and conditioning on warped masks for consistent stereo generation.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates and enhances stereo videos, even from low-quality inputs, using a single model.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

treating it as a mask matching task. Our method consists of: (1) A Mask-Context
Encoder that pools dense DINOv2 semantic features to obtain discriminative
object-level representations from FastSAM mask candidates, (2) an
Ego$\leftrightarrow$Exo Cross-Attention that fuses multi-perspective
observations, (3) a Mask Matching contrastive loss that aligns cross-view
features in a shared latent space, and (4) a Hard Negative Adjacent Mining
strategy to encourage the model to better differentiate between nearby objects.

### [238] [Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027)
*Yuhao Sun,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Chaowei Xiao,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI), a framework that adaptively adjusts noise levels in Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods for better accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DBP methods use a constant noise level for all samples, but the optimal noise level varies per sample. Cleaner samples need less noise, while noisier ones need more.

Method: SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate deviations from clean data (score norms) and adjusts noise levels adaptively per sample.

Result: SSNI improves accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K compared to constant noise level methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive noise injection per sample is crucial for DBP methods, and SSNI effectively implements this.

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR, a novel method using two adapters (AutoKL and CLIP) with Versatile Diffusion, effectively reconstructs complex visual stimuli from fMRI by combining topological and semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately reconstructing highly complex visual stimuli from fMRI due to their density, diversity, and multifaceted semantics.

Method: HAVIR employs two adapters: AutoKL for topological structures and CLIP for semantic information, fused by Versatile Diffusion. CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions and synthesized images.

Result: HAVIR outperforms existing models in reconstructing structural and semantic features of complex visual stimuli.

Conclusion: HAVIR successfully bridges neuroscience and computer vision by improving the reconstruction of complex visual information from brain activity.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

### [240] [Tensor-to-Tensor Models with Fast Iterated Sum Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06041)
*Joscha Diehl,Rasheed Ibraheem,Leonard Schmitz,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel tensor-to-tensor layer (FIS) with linear cost is proposed for processing high-dimensional data, achieving competitive performance in classification and anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data (e.g., images) requires efficient subquadratic processing layers, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Method: Utilizes 'corner trees' and a multiparameter generalization of iterated integrals to create the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer, integrating seamlessly with other layers.

Result: Achieves similar accuracy to larger ResNet models with fewer parameters and operations, and 97.3% AUROC in anomaly detection on MVTec AD.

Conclusion: The FIS layer is a scalable, efficient solution for high-dimensional data processing, validated in practical tasks.

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

*Taoran Yue,Xiaojin Lu,Jiaxi Cai,Yuanping Chen,Shibing Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDS-Net, a dual-branch CNN for infrared small target detection, addressing feature heterogeneity and inefficient fusion to improve accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IRSTD methods inefficiently handle shallow-deep feature collaboration and lack systematic fusion, limiting performance and increasing costs.

Method: SDS-Net uses a dual-branch architecture for structural and semantic features, with adaptive fusion for cross-layer correlations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on three datasets, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SDS-Net achieves superior IRSTD performance with low complexity, offering broad application potential.

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

### [242] [Full Conformal Adaptation of Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06076)
*Julio Silva-Rodríguez,Leo Fillioux,Paul-Henry Cournède,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Ismail Ben Ayed,Jose Dolz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the reliability of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical image analysis under split conformal prediction (SCP), proposing full conformal adaptation and SS-Text to improve efficiency and maintain coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite VLMs' discriminative potential in medical image analysis, their reliability under SCP remains unexplored, especially with few-shot transfer learning pipelines that don't align with SCP's assumptions.

Method: The authors introduce full conformal adaptation, a transductive approach for adapting and conformalizing VLMs, and SS-Text, a training-free linear probe solver to reduce computational costs.

Result: Experiments with 3 medical VLMs and 9 tasks show up to 27% improvement in set efficiency while maintaining coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances VLM reliability in medical applications without additional data, offering significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

### [243] [WisWheat: A Three-Tiered Vision-Language Dataset for Wheat Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06084)
*Bowen Yuan,Selena Song,Javier Fernandez,Yadan Luo,Mahsa Baktashmotlagh,Zijian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WisWheat dataset enhances VLMs for wheat management, improving accuracy in stress and growth stage tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wheat management is labor-intensive and subjective; VLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for effective application.

Method: Proposed WisWheat dataset with three layers: pretraining, quantitative traits, and instruction fine-tuning for stress and growth stages.

Result: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5 VL 7B outperforms GPT-4o by 11.9% and 34.6% in stress and growth stage tasks.

Conclusion: WisWheat significantly improves VLM performance for wheat management, offering scalable, data-driven solutions.

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

*Koulischer Felix,Handke Florian,Deleu Johannes,Demeester Thomas,Ambrogioni Luca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeedBack Guidance (FBG) improves conditional diffusion models by dynamically adjusting guidance based on sample needs, outperforming Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and competing with Limited Interval Guidance (LIG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG's constant guidance can harm diversity and induce memorization, prompting the need for a self-regulating approach.

Method: FBG uses a state-dependent coefficient to adapt guidance dynamically, derived from a linear corruption assumption of the conditional distribution.

Result: FBG outperforms CFG on ImageNet512x512 and adapts guidance scales effectively for complex prompts in Text-To-Image generation.

Conclusion: FBG offers a mathematically grounded, adaptable alternative to fixed guidance schemes like CFG and LIG.

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

### [245] [CLaMR: Contextualized Late-Interaction for Multimodal Content Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06144)
*David Wan,Han Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Jaemin Cho,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLaMR is a multimodal retriever that dynamically selects relevant modalities for video content retrieval, outperforming single- and multi-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval systems treat video modalities independently, leading to noisy results. A dynamic, joint approach is needed.

Method: CLaMR jointly indexes 4 modalities (video frames, speech, text, metadata) using a unified backbone and trains with a modality-aware loss on synthetic data (MultiVENT 2.0++).

Result: CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over single-modality and 35.4 over multi-modality retrievers, and boosts performance in downstream tasks like long-video QA.

Conclusion: CLaMR demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic modality selection and joint training for multimodal video retrieval.

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoChat-A1 is a novel agent paradigm for long video understanding, using chain-of-shot reasoning to mimic human thinking, outperforming baselines and competing with GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long videos due to redundant or noisy temporal context, lacking deep understanding of relevant shots.

Method: VideoChat-A1 employs a chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm, progressively selecting and analyzing relevant shots in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (77.0 on VideoMME, 70.1 on EgoSchema), outperforming baselines by up to 10.8% and 6.2%.

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1 effectively addresses long video understanding by mimicking human reasoning, offering competitive accuracy with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

*Zhanwen Liu,Huanna Song,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shangyu Xie,Yisheng An,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement using event cameras, addressing global noise and local structural issues, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras struggle with detail loss and motion blur in extreme low-light. Event-based methods ignore global noise and local discontinuities.

Method: BiLIE uses a frequency high-pass filtering module (EFE) for noise suppression and a Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) for smoother representations.

Result: BiLIE achieves 0.96dB higher PSNR and 0.03 better LPIPS than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BiLIE effectively enhances low-light images by addressing noise and structural issues, supported by a new high-quality dataset (RELIE).

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

TL;DR: CCLSTM, a lightweight convolutional LSTM model, achieves top performance in occupancy flow prediction without relying on vectorized inputs or transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting dynamic agents' states in autonomous driving rely on high-quality vectorized inputs and computationally intensive transformers, which are impractical.

Method: Proposes CCLSTM, an end-to-end trainable architecture using convolutional operations to capture temporal dynamics and spatial correlations without self-attention.

Result: CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance and ranks 1st in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge.

Conclusion: CCLSTM offers a practical, efficient solution for occupancy flow prediction, outperforming complex transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy

### [249] [A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155)

TL;DR: The paper introduces H2Crop, a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset, and a dual-stream Transformer for fine-grained crop classification, combining hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 data for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained crop classification is essential for precision agriculture and food security but faces challenges due to limited hyperspectral data and high annotation costs.

Method: A dual-stream Transformer architecture processes hyperspectral EnMAP data (spectral-spatial Transformer) and Sentinel-2 time series (temporal Swin Transformer), with hierarchical fusion for multi-level classification.

Result: Adding hyperspectral data improves F1-scores by 4.2% on average (peaking at 6.3%), outperforming existing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The H2Crop dataset and dual-stream Transformer provide a robust benchmark and method for fine-grained crop classification, demonstrating the value of hyperspectral data.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MF$^2$, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to comprehend and recall key narrative details from full-length movies, highlighting their shortcomings compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for VLMs focus on superficial details or use semi-automated questions, failing to assess deep comprehension of long-form video content.

Method: MF$^2$ includes 50+ full-length movies with manually constructed claim pairs (true/false) targeting core narrative elements, evaluated via binary claim identification.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly worse than humans, revealing their inability to retain and reason over critical narrative information.

Conclusion: The MF$^2$ benchmark exposes VLMs' limitations in holistic video understanding, emphasizing the gap between human and model capabilities.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over

*Constantin Patsch,Marsil Zakour,Yuankai Wu,Eckehard Steinbach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online mistake detection framework for real-time video analysis, addressing both procedural and execution errors, and uses an LLM for feedback. It ranks second on the HoloAssist benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time mistake detection is crucial in domains like industrial automation and education, but existing methods focus only on procedural errors, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The proposed framework detects procedural and execution errors (e.g., motor slips) and employs an LLM to generate explanatory feedback upon error detection.

Result: The framework was tested on the HoloAssist benchmark, achieving second place in mistake detection.

Conclusion: The approach effectively broadens error detection beyond procedural mistakes and demonstrates practical viability.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large
language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the
HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

*Zhenyu Yu,Mohd. Yamani Idna Idris,Pei Wang,Yuelong Xia,Fei Ma,Rizwan Qureshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatelliteFormula is a symbolic regression framework for deriving interpretable expressions from multi-spectral remote sensing imagery, combining Vision Transformers with physics-guided constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression methods struggle with high-dimensional multi-spectral data, and black-box models lack interpretability. SatelliteFormula aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a Vision Transformer-based encoder for feature extraction and integrates it with a symbolic optimizer under physics-guided constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, stability, and generalization on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula provides interpretable modeling of environmental variables, combining data-driven learning with physical understanding.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and
physical understanding.

*Christian Fruhwirth-Reisinger,Dušan Malić,Wei Lin,David Schinagl,Samuel Schulter,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STSBench is a framework for benchmarking vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving, focusing on spatio-temporal reasoning. It includes STSnu, a benchmark derived from NuScenes, evaluating VLMs on complex traffic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VLMs lack evaluation of spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving, a critical capability for real-world applications.

Method: STSBench mines traffic scenarios from datasets, provides a UI for human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions. STSnu evaluates VLMs on 43 scenarios with 971 questions.

Result: Evaluation reveals VLMs' shortcomings in reasoning about traffic dynamics, emphasizing the need for improved spatio-temporal modeling.

Conclusion: STSBench fills a gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, aiding the development of robust VLMs for autonomous driving.

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

### [254] [GenIR: Generative Visual Feedback for Mental Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06220)
*Diji Yang,Minghao Liu,Chung-Hsiang Lo,Yi Zhang,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), a multi-round interactive task for refining image searches based on mental images. It proposes GenIR, a generative method using diffusion models for clear feedback, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image retrieval lacks realism as human searches are multi-round and guided by mental images. The gap between benchmarks and real-world applications motivates the study of MIR.

Method: GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm, uses diffusion-based image generation to provide explicit visual feedback, aiding query refinement. A pipeline for dataset generation is also introduced.

Result: GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work establishes MIR as a new task, provides a dataset, and introduces GenIR, laying a foundation for future research in interactive image retrieval.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs show promise for basic surgical tasks but struggle with medical knowledge; specialized medical VLMs underperform generalist models, indicating a need for further optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in endoscopic tasks, particularly laparoscopic surgery, and compare specialized medical VLMs with generalist models.

Method: Evaluated multiple state-of-the-art VLMs using diverse surgical datasets and human annotations to address three key research questions about perception and scene understanding.

Result: VLMs perform well on basic tasks like object counting but falter with medical knowledge; specialized medical VLMs underperform generalist models.

Conclusion: Specialized medical VLMs need optimization for surgical environments, highlighting areas for improvement in next-generation endoscopic AI systems.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Optimized GeoTIFF loading for deep learning on petabyte-scale Earth observation data, achieving 20x remote and 4x local throughput improvements, matching local training accuracy with better GPU utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PyTorch data loaders underutilize GPUs when streaming GeoTIFF files from cloud storage, necessitating optimized configurations for efficient training.

Method: Benchmarked GeoTIFF loading throughput from cloud and local storage, tested loader configurations (tile-aligned reads, worker pools), and used Bayesian optimization for optimal settings.

Result: 20x remote and 4x local throughput gains, matching local training accuracy, 6-15% validation IoU improvement, and 85-95% GPU utilization.

Conclusion: Optimized configurations enable efficient deep learning on large-scale EO data, improving performance and resource utilization.

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

*Zahra Babaiee,Peyman M. Kiasari,Daniela Rus,Radu Grosu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Visual Graph Arena (VGA) to evaluate AI's ability for visual abstraction, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of 'conceptualization'—AI's ability to recognize and reason about concepts despite visual variations—a key human reasoning skill.

Method: VGA uses six graph-based tasks with diverse layouts to test representation-invariant reasoning, evaluating state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs.

Result: Humans achieved near-perfect accuracy, while AI models failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks, indicating pseudo-intelligent pattern matching.

Conclusion: VGA highlights fundamental AI limitations in visual understanding and provides a framework to advance human-like conceptualization in AI models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Motivation: To explore the synergistic potential of combining egocentric and exocentric perspectives for richer video understanding, mimicking human cognition.

Method: Systematic review of three research directions: leveraging egocentric data for exocentric understanding, using exocentric data for egocentric analysis, and joint learning frameworks.

Result: Identifies key tasks, benchmarks, and advancements, while highlighting current limitations and future opportunities.

Conclusion: Aims to inspire progress in AI by integrating dual perspectives for human-like video understanding.

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

TL;DR: BecomingLit introduces a method for creating relightable, high-resolution head avatars using a low-cost light stage setup, a new dataset, and a hybrid neural shading approach. It outperforms existing methods in relighting and reenactment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a cost-effective and efficient way to reconstruct relightable, high-resolution head avatars for interactive rendering from novel viewpoints.

Method: The method involves a low-cost light stage setup for capturing faces, a dataset of multi-view sequences, a relightable avatar representation using 3D Gaussian primitives, and a hybrid neural shading approach combining neural diffuse BRDF with analytical specular terms.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in relighting and reenactment, validated through extensive experiments on the new dataset.

Conclusion: BecomingLit successfully achieves high-quality, relightable head avatars with efficient animation and control from monocular videos, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

TL;DR: STARFlow is a scalable generative model using normalizing flows and Transformers for high-resolution image synthesis, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of normalizing flows and Autoregressive Transformers for scalable, high-quality image generation.

Method: Introduces Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow) with deep-shallow design, latent space modeling, and a novel guidance algorithm for scalability and quality.

Result: Competes with state-of-the-art diffusion models in class- and text-conditional image generation tasks.

Conclusion: STARFlow is the first successful large-scale normalizing flow model for high-resolution image synthesis.

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Motivation: To advance VLMs' ability to understand nuanced, expert-level human skills in physical and procedural domains.

Method: ExAct includes 3,521 expert-curated video Q&A pairs across 11 activities in 6 domains, with 5 candidate options per question.

Result: GPT-4o achieves 44.70% accuracy, significantly below human experts' 82.02%.

Conclusion: ExAct is a valuable benchmark for developing VLMs with precise skill understanding.

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level
understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains
3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only

TL;DR: CoMemo introduces a dual-path architecture and RoPE-DHR positional encoding to improve multimodal processing in LVLMs, addressing attention neglect and 2D structural loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs inherit suboptimal LLM designs, causing attention neglect and poor 2D spatial awareness in visual processing.

Method: CoMemo uses a dual-path (Context and Memory paths) for visual processing and RoPE-DHR for 2D positional encoding.

Result: Outperforms conventional LVLMs in benchmarks for long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual QA.

Conclusion: CoMemo effectively mitigates visual neglect and preserves spatial relationships, enhancing LVLM performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for Earth observation lack scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity in training data, limiting their global transferability.

Method: TerraFM uses globally distributed Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, modality-specific patch embeddings, adaptive cross-attention fusion, and a dual-centering mechanism with class-frequency-aware regularization.

Result: TerraFM achieves strong generalization on classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench.

Conclusion: TerraFM demonstrates the effectiveness of scalable self-supervised learning with enriched spatial and semantic coverage for Earth observation tasks.

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GPT-4V's capabilities in image forensics, specifically for detecting image splicing, without task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4V using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting on a subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy in zero-shot settings, with CoT prompting providing balanced performance. The model uses visual and contextual cues.

Conclusion: GPT-4V shows promise as a flexible tool in image forensics due to its generalizability and interpretability, though it lags behind specialized models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Motivation: To address the need for accurate and real-time CO₂ emission detection, particularly in livestock management and environmental sensing.

Method: Integrates a multi-scale context aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components, tested on novel datasets (CCR and RTA).

Result: Achieves 88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with 60.95 FPS. A lightweight variant, CarboFormer, offers 84.68 FPS and competitive performance.

Conclusion: CarboNeXT and CarboFormer provide robust tools for CO₂ emission analysis, advancing environmental sensing and precision livestock management.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock

Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context

model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in

lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our

*Tinglin Huang,Tianyu Liu,Mehrtash Babadi,Wengong Jin,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STFlow, a flow matching generative model, improves spatial transcriptomics prediction by modeling cell-cell interactions and addressing memory constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting spatial transcriptomics (ST) from histology images lack explicit modeling of cell-cell interactions and face memory limitations due to large datasets.

Method: STFlow uses a flow matching generative model to jointly model gene expression across an entire slide and employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention.

Result: STFlow achieves over 18% relative improvement on benchmarks (HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: STFlow effectively addresses key limitations in ST prediction, offering a scalable and accurate solution.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a seed selection method for diffusion-based image coding to improve quality without extra bitrate, using intermediate outputs for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either require extra bitrate for scalability or use a single random seed, leading to suboptimal image quality.

Method: Selects the optimal seed from multiple candidates using intermediate outputs from early reverse diffusion steps to reduce computational cost.

Result: Outperforms the baseline in multiple metrics without increasing bitrate.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances image quality efficiently.

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based method for generating stereo images from text prompts, leveraging Stable Diffusion and fine-tuning for improved stereo consistency and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo image datasets with large baselines are scarce, making training a diffusion model from scratch impractical.

Method: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on stereo datasets, enhance with prompt alignment and stereo consistency reward functions.

Result: Generates high-quality stereo images, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts diffusion models for stereo image generation, achieving superior results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its

historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of easily manipulated images and videos spreads false information, necessitating advanced detection tools to combat evolving counterfeiting methods.

Method: An independent discriminant network, leveraging InceptionResNetV2, is developed to identify GAN-generated content, with a proposed platform for user detection.

Result: The discriminant network effectively detects counterfeit images and videos, supporting forensic identification of criminal activities.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a practical solution to combat misinformation by detecting forged content, benefiting forensic investigations.

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence
towards the identification of criminal activities.

Method: Review of existing approaches using computer vision algorithms for object detection and tracking in UAVs.

Result: Identifies potential solutions for UAV autonomy through real-time processing and robust algorithms.

Conclusion: Computer vision can significantly improve UAV autonomy, enabling diverse applications like disaster management and surveillance.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet for fair biometric face authentication across demographic groups, testing performance with few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness and generalization challenges in biometric face authentication across diverse demographic groups.

Method: Combined pre-trained ViT and ResNet features, trained on custom datasets, and tested with a few-shot prototype network on demographic-specific datasets.

Result: Microsoft Swin Transformer outperformed other ViT models; performance improved with larger support sets.

Conclusion: ViT and ResNet can enhance fairness in face authentication, with the Swin Transformer being particularly effective.

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified two-stage training framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to jointly optimize visual quality scoring and reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs treat quality scoring and reasoning as separate tasks, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This limits their potential in visual quality assessment.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) cold-start stage with data distillation and cross-entropy loss, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize scoring and reasoning.

Result: Q-Ponder achieves SOTA performance (6.5% higher SRCC) and outperforms description-based models in accuracy and reasonableness.

Conclusion: The unified framework enhances both scoring accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating generalization potential across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient keyframe extraction is challenging; existing methods often fail to fully capture video content richness.

Method: Integrates CIELAB color features, ResNet-50 embeddings, and Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct captions, fused via PCA and clustered with HDBSCAN, followed by refinement.

Result: Outperforms traditional unimodal and prior multi-modal methods on TVSum20 and SumMe datasets.

Conclusion: TriPSS sets a new benchmark for video content understanding by effectively capturing nuanced visual and semantic information.

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

TL;DR: Talk2SAM improves segmentation of complex objects by integrating textual guidance into SAM-HQ, enhancing accuracy and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models like SAM and SAM-HQ struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, leading to poor segmentation quality.

Method: Talk2SAM uses CLIP-based embeddings from text prompts, projects them into DINO feature space, and integrates them into SAM-HQ for better focus on target objects.

Result: Outperforms SAM-HQ by up to +5.9% IoU and +8.3% boundary IoU on benchmarks (BIG, ThinObject5K, DIS5K).

Conclusion: Natural language guidance offers a flexible and effective solution for precise segmentation, especially where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Motivation: High latency and computational overhead in VLMs hinder real-time application in autonomous driving, especially due to over-inference.

Method: Proposes AD-EE, leveraging domain characteristics and causal inference to identify optimal exit layers for early termination.

Result: Tested on Waymo, CODA, and Autoware Universe, AD-EE achieves significant latency reduction and accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: AD-EE effectively addresses inefficiencies in VLMs for autonomous driving, enhancing real-time performance and accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Motivation: To ensure stability and safety in scientific workflows by detecting visual anomalies timely.

Result: Detection accuracy improves with more contextual information, and real-world validations confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach provides a data-driven foundation and evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific workflows.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual

proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify

### [282] [Object-level Self-Distillation for Vision Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05409)
*Çağlar Hızlı,Çağatay Yıldız,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS introduces object-level self-distillation for vision pretraining, improving representations by focusing on individual objects rather than whole images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining assumes single-object images, limiting scalability to complex scenes. ODIS addresses this by isolating object-specific regions.

Method: ODIS uses object-aware cropping and masked attention to guide transformers toward meaningful content, simplifying scene-level tasks into object-level ones.

Result: ODIS achieves 82.6% k-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large, demonstrating improved visual representations.

Conclusion: ODIS enhances pretraining by shifting focus to object-level granularity, improving performance on complex datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: Most Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform poorly at gaze-referential inference, unlike humans, but top-tier VLMs show some capability, hinting at potential for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of VLMs to infer gaze-referential information, a critical skill for natural human-AI interaction.

Method: Evaluated 111 VLMs and 65 humans using manipulated photos, analyzing performance with mixed-effects models.

Result: 94 VLMs performed no better than random guessing, while humans excelled. Top-tier VLMs showed task-dependent performance but robustness to perceptual variations.

Conclusion: VLMs lack robust gaze inference but exhibit potential for future development in human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench is the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized audio, and SAVVY is a novel training-free pipeline to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AV-LLMs and benchmarks focus on static or 2D scenes, leaving dynamic 3D spatial reasoning unexplored.

Method: SAVVY uses a two-stage pipeline: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction.

Result: SAVVY improves state-of-the-art AV-LLMs' performance in dynamic 3D spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: SAVVY sets a new standard for dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

*Nafiseh Izadyar,Sai Chandra Madduri,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an HDF5-based alternative to STEP format for CAD B-rep data, enabling broader usage in learning pipelines without costly CAD kernel licenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The STEP format's reliance on CAD kernels limits its use in large-scale learning due to licensing costs.

Method: The authors propose an HDF5-based format, provide a Python library for processing, and convert existing datasets (Fusion 360, ABC).

Result: The new format was validated through four use cases (normal estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, segmentation), showing compliance with original STEP files.

Conclusion: The HDF5-based format offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for CAD data in learning pipelines.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

TL;DR: SPD method improves vision-based RL by extracting task-relevant features from images with distractions, outperforming prior methods in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of task-irrelevant distractions (e.g., shadows, clouds) in vision-based RL, especially when unseen during training.

Method: Uses Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) with weak and strong augmentations to predict inverse and forward transitions for feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in MuJoCo and CARLA tasks, improving generalization for unseen observations.

Conclusion: SPD effectively handles distractions and enhances generalization in vision-based RL.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

TL;DR: Dr. G is a self-supervised MBRL method using dual contrastive learning and recurrent state inverse dynamics to improve robustness against visual distractions, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure of MBRL algorithms in handling visual distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows) in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Dr. G with dual contrastive learning for task-relevant feature capture and a recurrent state inverse dynamics model for temporal understanding.

Result: Achieves 117% and 14% performance improvements over prior works in tested environments.

Conclusion: Dr. G enhances MBRL robustness against distractions, demonstrating strong generalization in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

*Seunghwan Shin,Yusung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight one-stage MPPE model using raw RF signals with sub-grouping and multi-head attention, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RF-based MPPE methods are either computationally intensive or lack accuracy. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: Sub-group RF signals, embed using a shared single-layer CNN and multi-head attention, and introduce a self-supervised learning method for masked data prediction.

Result: Improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15% in PCKh@0.5 and enhances performance in new locations or with obstacles.

Conclusion: The proposed model is efficient, accurate, and generalizable, with open-sourced code and dataset.

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIV-Bench is a video benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in social scene understanding, reasoning, and dynamics prediction, revealing strengths in scene understanding but struggles in reasoning and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of human social interaction complexity for AI by creating a benchmark to evaluate MLLMs.

Method: Developed SIV-Bench with 2,792 video clips and 8,792 QA pairs from TikTok/YouTube, testing MLLMs on SSU, SSR, and SDP.

Result: MLLMs excel in SSU but struggle with SSR and SDP, with Relation Inference as a key bottleneck. Transcribed dialogue aids comprehension.

Conclusion: SIV-Bench identifies MLLMs' limitations and strengths, guiding future AI development for social intelligence.

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

TL;DR: The paper introduces a surrogate model to generate adversarial perturbations for vision-language models, demonstrating superior performance in compromising their robustness compared to existing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models lack robustness against perturbations, necessitating evaluation and improvement of their inter-modal dependencies.

Method: A surrogate model is trained to generate joint representations and adversarial perturbations for both image and text modalities, evaluated on visual question answering and reasoning datasets.

Result: The proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal and single-modality attacks, effectively compromising state-of-the-art models like instruct-BLIP and ViLT.

Conclusion: The work highlights vulnerabilities in vision-language models and presents a coordinated attack strategy to assess and improve their robustness.

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is proposed to evaluate video classification robustness by targeting sensitive spatial and temporal regions with minimal perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video classification models are more complex and costly to evaluate for robustness compared to image-based models, requiring minimal perturbations for misclassification.

Method: Uses multi-agent reinforcement learning (spatial and temporal) to cooperatively identify and perturb sensitive regions while maintaining temporal coherence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on Lp metric and average queries, with custom distortion types for relevance. Evaluated on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective and visually imperceptible attack for robustness evaluation, applicable to popular video action recognition models.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-based VLMs compensate for weak visual features with strong language backbones, enabling performance recovery in reduced contextualization scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if the language backbone in VLMs compensates for weak visual features from CLIP-based encoders.

Method: Controlled self-attention ablations on three CLIP-based VLMs using a probing task.

Result: CLIP visual representations provide semantic info, but language decoders can compensate for visual deficiencies.

Conclusion: VLMs dynamically balance visual and language processing, suggesting future architectures can offload more visual processing to language decoders.

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation method for Visual Language Models (VLMs) using synthetic images to systematically test and analyze perception failures, addressing limitations of current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks are costly, prone to leakage, and lack clarity on failure causes (perception, reasoning, or knowledge).

Method: Procedural generation of synthetic images with controlled variations to isolate and test visual perception in VLMs.

Result: Enables fine-grained failure analysis and targeted assessment of VLM capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method shifts focus from coarse benchmarking to interpretable evaluation, improving VLM assessment.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces NuScenes-S, a structured benchmark dataset, and FastDrive, a compact Vision-Language Model (VLM) for autonomous driving, addressing redundancy and computational inefficiencies in existing VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs for autonomous driving suffer from loosely formatted datasets and high computational costs, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: Developed NuScenes-S, a structured dataset, and FastDrive, a 0.9B-parameter VLM, to improve efficiency and performance.

Result: FastDrive achieves 20% higher accuracy in decision-making and 10x faster inference than larger VLMs.

Conclusion: Structured datasets and compact VLMs like FastDrive enhance autonomous driving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Motivation: Deep learning models for SAR image segmentation struggle with convergence and stability due to complex data distributions.

Method: Evaluate mode normalization's impact on U-Net and SegNet by integrating it to reduce convergence time while maintaining performance.

Result: Mode normalization accelerates convergence and enhances model stability across different zones.

Conclusion: Normalization boosts computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing image degradation issues that affect visual quality and downstream tasks in real-world applications.

Method: Employing a VLM to classify images into degradation types (A-D) and using dedicated restoration models for each type.

Result: Effective classification and restoration, enhancing image quality with specialized models.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, automated solution for image enhancement using VLMs and advanced restoration techniques.

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

TL;DR: RADAR is a novel method for detecting and localizing image manipulations, especially inpainted areas, using foundation models and multimodal features. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is tested on a new benchmark, BBC-PAIR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of advanced diffusion models for image manipulation necessitates reliable tools to detect such edits, as misuse becomes a growing concern.

Method: RADAR combines features from different image modalities and uses an auxiliary contrastive loss to isolate manipulated patches. It leverages foundation models for robustness.

Result: RADAR achieves superior accuracy and generalization across 28 diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in detecting and localizing edits.

Conclusion: RADAR is a highly effective solution for identifying image manipulations, with potential for broad application due to its robustness and performance.

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2GO introduces a query-based 3D representation for occupancy prediction, outperforming dense methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense 3D representations are slow and inflexible for dynamic driving scenes, prompting a need for a more efficient approach.

Method: Summarizes scenes into 3D queries, propagates them temporally, and decodes into semantic Gaussians with a denoising rendering objective.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and KITTI benchmarks, with 1.5 IoU improvement and 5.9x faster inference than GaussianWorld.

Conclusion: S2GO's query-based approach is efficient and effective for 3D occupancy prediction in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,

### [299] [OpenRR-5k: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Reflection Removal in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05482)
*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Ling Ouyang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark and dataset for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) is introduced, featuring 5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, with 5,000 for training, 300 for validation, and 100 real-world test images. A U-Net model is trained and evaluated using five metrics, and the dataset and code will be publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reflection removal methods lack large-scale, diverse datasets, limiting their effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive dataset.

Method: A U-Net-based model is trained on the new dataset, which includes 5,300 pixel-aligned image pairs (5,000 training, 300 validation, 100 test). Evaluation uses PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE metrics.

Result: The dataset and model are validated, with the dataset covering diverse real-world scenarios and the model evaluated using multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The benchmark and dataset will support future research in reflection removal, with the dataset and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate
future research in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural network model mimicking human visual attention was developed, showing emergent patterns similar to human spatial and feature-based attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how top-down information influences visual processing and to bridge insights between human cognition and computer vision.

Method: A dual-network model: one for basic tasks, the other for contextual guidance via attention.

Result: The model's learned attention patterns resembled human spatial and feature-based attention.

Conclusion: Neural network models can effectively simulate human visual attention, offering a tool for cognitive studies.

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

### [301] [Implicit Neural Representation for Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05488)
*Mary Aiyetigbo,Wanqi Yuan,Feng Luo,Nianyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VR-INR is a video restoration method using Implicit Neural Representations, trained for a single upscaling factor but generalizing to arbitrary scales and zero-shot denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VR methods lack flexibility for unseen scales or degradations, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: VR-INR uses hierarchical spatial-temporal-texture encoding and multi-resolution implicit hash encoding for adaptive decoding.

Result: VR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling unseen scales and noise, achieving high-quality reconstructions.

Conclusion: VR-INR offers a flexible and effective solution for video restoration, generalizing beyond training conditions.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces F2T2-HiT, a Transformer-based architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR), combining FFT and Hierarchical Transformers in a UNet framework to handle complex reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflections degrade image quality, and existing methods struggle with their variability in intensity, shape, and size.

Method: Proposes F2T2-HiT, integrating FFT Transformer blocks for global frequency analysis and Hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale feature extraction in a UNet.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT effectively addresses the challenges of SIRR, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusDiff improves fine-grained text-image alignment by focusing on subtle differences in similar text-image pairs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment, failing precise control over visual tokens, as revealed by the PairComp benchmark.

Method: Proposes FocusDiff, using a new dataset of paired texts/images with similar expressions but distinct local semantics, and a reinforcement learning algorithm to emphasize fine-grained differences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Conclusion: FocusDiff effectively addresses fine-grained alignment challenges, enabling more precise control in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORSE-500 is a new video benchmark addressing limitations of current multimodal reasoning benchmarks by focusing on temporal complexity, diverse reasoning skills, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack temporal dynamics, narrow focus on math, and saturate quickly, limiting progress measurement and failure diagnosis.

Method: MORSE-500 includes 500 scripted video clips with questions across six reasoning categories, generated using Python scripts, generative models, and real footage.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps, especially in abstract and planning tasks.

Conclusion: MORSE-500 offers a scalable, evolving benchmark for robust multimodal reasoning research, with released resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YoursProtoP introduces an interactive strategy to personalize prototypical parts in concept-based interpretable neural networks, addressing concept inconsistency and user feedback limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept-based explanations suffer from concept inconsistency and lack user feedback mechanisms, misaligning model reasoning with human understanding.

Method: YoursProtoP adapts and splits visual concepts using user supervision to align with user preferences and understanding.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show YoursProtoP achieves concept consistency without sacrificing model accuracy.

Conclusion: YoursProtoP effectively bridges the gap between model explanations and user comprehension by incorporating personalized feedback.

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

TL;DR: FRAME is a self-supervised video frame encoder designed for dense video understanding, outperforming image encoders and existing video models on dense prediction tasks while maintaining a compact architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image encoders lack temporal awareness, and video models underperform on dense prediction tasks, creating a gap FRAME aims to address.

Method: FRAME predicts current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, ensuring spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. It also aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space for language-driven tasks.

Result: FRAME consistently outperforms image encoders and self-supervised video models across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets.

Conclusion: FRAME bridges the gap between image and video encoders, excelling in dense video understanding while remaining versatile and compact for downstream applications.

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

*Vadim Tschernezki,Diane Larlus,Andrea Vedaldi,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improving dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing 2D motion predictions into layered radiance fields, addressing challenges with test-time refinement to outperform 2D baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D techniques struggle with dynamic phenomena, especially in segmenting moving objects. The paper aims to bridge this gap by enhancing 3D methods for dynamic scenes.

Method: Proposes Layered Motion Fusion to integrate 2D motion segmentation into 3D layered radiance fields, using test-time refinement to manage data complexity.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms 2D baselines, demonstrating 3D techniques can enhance dynamic scene analysis.

Conclusion: 3D methods can effectively improve 2D analysis for dynamic scenes, even in challenging settings.

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic hallucination in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when handling ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, proposing a training-free framework (ZoomText and Grounded Layer Correction) to mitigate it, validated on a new benchmark (TextHalu-Bench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, often producing incorrect answers (semantic hallucination). The work aims to understand and mitigate this issue.

Method: Proposes a framework with ZoomText (coarse-to-fine text region identification) and Grounded Layer Correction (using less hallucination-prone layers to guide decoding).

Result: The method effectively reduces semantic hallucination and performs well on scene text benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates semantic hallucination in LMMs without additional training, validated by a comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

TL;DR: EX-4D is a framework for generating high-quality, camera-controllable videos from monocular input using a Depth Watertight Mesh representation and a LoRA-based video diffusion adapter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in extreme viewpoints, degrading visual quality.

Method: EX-4D uses a Depth Watertight Mesh for geometric consistency and a simulated masking strategy for training data. A LoRA-based video diffusion adapter synthesizes high-quality videos.

Result: EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in physical consistency and extreme-view quality.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical 4D video generation with improved geometric and visual quality.

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

*Andreas Meuleman,Ishaan Shah,Alexandre Lanvin,Bernhard Kerbl,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast on-the-fly method for camera pose estimation and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) training, handling wide baselines and large scenes efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for pose estimation and 3DGS optimization are slow or struggle with wide baselines and large scenes.

Method: Uses fast initial pose estimation with learned features and GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment, plus direct sampling of Gaussian primitives for incremental training.

Result: Enables real-time processing of dense, wide-baseline captures and large scenes, competitive in speed and quality.

Conclusion: The method efficiently combines pose estimation and 3DGS training, scalable for large scenes and diverse capture scenarios.

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

TL;DR: VoxelSplat is a novel regularization framework for camera-based occupancy prediction, improving 3D semantics and scene flow estimation using 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like occlusions and unbalanced dynamic environments in 3D semantics and scene flow prediction.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for enhanced semantics supervision via 2D projection and self-supervised scene flow learning.

Result: Improves accuracy of semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation without increasing inference time.

Conclusion: VoxelSplat effectively enhances performance in occupancy prediction tasks and is adaptable to existing models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

TL;DR: PartCrafter is a 3D generative model that synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct 3D meshes from a single RGB image, using a unified, compositional architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either produce monolithic 3D shapes or require pre-segmented inputs. PartCrafter aims to enable end-to-end part-aware generation without relying on segmentation.

Method: PartCrafter uses a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) and introduces a compositional latent space and hierarchical attention mechanism for structured generation.

Result: The model outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D meshes, including parts not visible in input images.

Conclusion: PartCrafter demonstrates the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding and synthesis, with plans to release code and training data.

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

TL;DR: UniRes, a diffusion-based framework, addresses complex image degradations by combining specialized models, showing strong performance on in-the-wild data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with generalization to real-world degradations, which are often complex mixtures of multiple types.

Method: Proposes UniRes, a flexible diffusion-based framework that integrates specialized models during sampling, leveraging isolated training data.

Result: Outperforms on complex and single-degradation datasets, with notable gains for complex cases.

Conclusion: UniRes effectively handles complex degradations, offering flexibility and improved performance for real-world image restoration.

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

*Shuchen Lin,Mingtao Feng,Weisheng Dong,Fangfang Wu,Jianqiao Luo,Yaonan Wang,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach for Real-SR, addressing task imbalance through task segmentation, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-SR is challenging due to complex degradation patterns; existing methods lack balance in handling diverse degradations within a fixed space.

Method: Frames Real-SR as multi-task learning, introduces task segmentation, focal loss-based imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.

Result: Demonstrates consistent superiority across all degradation tasks in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm effectively balances degradation handling in Real-SR, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

*Shanmukha Vellamcheti,Sanjoy Kundu,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative visual grounding framework using LLMs for open-world visual relationship detection, outperforming baselines on unseen predicates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VRD models rely on fixed predicate sets, limiting generalization to novel interactions. This work aims to ground semantically plausible but unannotated relationships using LLMs.

Method: An EM-inspired framework alternates between generating candidate scene graphs with LLMs and training a visual model to align hypotheses with perceptual evidence.

Result: The model achieves mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on seen, unseen, and mixed predicate sets, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Grounded LLM priors show promise for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

*Yimei Liu,Yakun Ju,Yuan Rao,Hao Fan,Junyu Dong,Feng Gao,Qian Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADR-MVS improves 3D urban reconstruction from aerial images by integrating monocular geometric cues and adaptive depth range prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS methods fail to address key differences in aerial settings, like varying depth ranges and low-detailed images, leading to inaccurate depth estimation.

Method: ADR-MVS uses a depth range predictor with cross-attention discrepancy learning, adaptive range maps, and normal-guided cost aggregation for precise depth regression.

Result: ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and München datasets with superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: ADR-MVS effectively addresses aerial-specific challenges, enhancing depth estimation accuracy and computational performance in 3D urban reconstruction.

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TissUnet, a deep learning model, segments extracranial tissues from brain MRI scans accurately and efficiently, validated across diverse datasets including healthy and pathological cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracranial tissues in brain MRIs are underutilized for health characterization. Current tools lack validation, especially for developing brains or pathology.

Method: TissUnet was trained on 155 MRI-CT pairs and validated across nine datasets, including healthy and tumor cases, using Dice coefficients and expert annotations.

Result: TissUnet achieved median Dice coefficients of 0.79-0.83, outperforming prior methods, with 89% acceptance in testing and excellent performance in blinded reviews.

Conclusion: TissUnet provides fast, accurate, and reproducible extracranial tissue segmentation, enabling large-scale studies on health conditions using standard brain MRI.

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveAction is a new benchmark for VLA models in autonomous driving, featuring diverse scenarios, real-world action labels, and a structured evaluation framework. It shows VLMs need both vision and language inputs for accurate action prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and human-aligned evaluation protocols, limiting VLA model development.

Method: DriveAction uses 16,185 QA pairs from 2,610 driving scenarios, with real-world data and action labels. It employs an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework.

Result: VLMs perform worse without vision (3.3% drop) or language (4.1% drop) inputs, and significantly worse (8.0% drop) without both.

Conclusion: DriveAction provides a rigorous foundation for improving human-like decisions in autonomous driving by identifying model bottlenecks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies 3D token structures for MLLMs, comparing video-based and point-based representations. It introduces a method using 3D point cloud features, showing improved performance and competitive results with video-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective 3D scene representation for MLLMs is challenging, with existing methods relying on 2D features. This work aims to explore and improve 3D tokenization.

Method: The study compares video-based and point-based 3D representations, using a Point Transformer V3 encoder for point cloud features. It merges explicit 3D features into visual tokens.

Result: Incorporating 3D features boosts performance, and point-based structures can rival video-based ones with clever sampling. State-of-the-art results are achieved on 3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: The analysis of token structures is a key contribution, and transparent reporting of results is emphasized for robust progress in the field.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoralCLIP extends vision-language models to incorporate moral reasoning using Moral Foundations Theory, improving moral content understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models lack moral reasoning, a key aspect of human cognition. MoralCLIP addresses this gap.

Method: MoralCLIP integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, using a moral data augmentation strategy and a dataset of 15,000 image-text pairs.

Result: Explicit moral supervision enhances unimodal and multimodal moral content understanding.

Conclusion: MoralCLIP lays the groundwork for morally-aware AI systems aligned with human values.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a many-to-many Token Transforming framework for compressing vision transformers, unifying existing methods and minimizing information loss without post-training. It achieves significant FLOP reduction and speedup with minimal accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token compression methods in vision transformers cause information loss and require post-training. The paper aims to unify and generalize these methods while preserving information.

Method: The authors introduce a many-to-many Token Transforming framework, treating token reduction as a matrix transformation. This framework generalizes existing methods and enables training-free acceleration.

Result: Experiments show a 40% FLOP reduction and 1.5x speedup for DeiT-S with only a 0.1% accuracy drop. The method also performs well in dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a better computation-performance trade-off, significant budget reduction, and inference acceleration across various tasks.

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

TL;DR: YOEO is a single-stage method for category-level pose estimation of articulated objects, improving efficiency and performance over multi-stage pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational costs and low performance of existing multi-stage pipelines in real-time robotic tasks.

Method: A unified network outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations, using centroid voting and clustering for part distinction, followed by alignment for pose recovery.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on the GAPart dataset and real-world deployment with a Kinova robot at 200Hz.

Conclusion: YOEO offers a practical, efficient solution for real-time robotic manipulation of articulated objects.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the relationship between weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure for polygonal approximation, concluding they are independent and not interchangeable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if weighted figure of merit can substitute Rosin's measure for comparing sub-optimal polygonal approximation schemes.

Method: Theoretical analysis, experimental investigation using public datasets, and statistical analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient).

Result: The two measures are theoretically independent, experimentally uncorrelated, and cannot be used interchangeably.

Conclusion: Weighted figure of merit cannot replace Rosin's measure for comparing sub-optimal schemes.

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking

consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether large vision language models (LVLMs) are susceptible to visual illusions like humans, using a new VQA dataset to distinguish genuine and fake illusions. Results suggest LVLMs may rely on prior knowledge rather than visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if machines exhibit human-like susceptibility to visual illusions and address ambiguities in assessing machine cognition.

Method: Introduces a VQA dataset with genuine and fake illusions, evaluating LVLMs' ability to discern actual vs. apparent features.

Result: LVLMs predict similar answers for genuine and fake illusions, indicating reliance on prior knowledge, not visual understanding.

Conclusion: LVLMs may not genuinely understand visual illusions, highlighting limitations in their visual cognition.

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method addresses sensor staleness in autonomous vehicles by using timestamp offsets and data augmentation, improving performance under stale conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor staleness causes temporal misalignment, degrading trajectory predictions critical for safety in autonomous vehicles.

Method: Uses per-point timestamp offsets and data augmentation to simulate realistic staleness patterns, integrated into a perspective-view detection model.

Result: The approach maintains consistent performance under both synchronized and stale conditions, unlike conventional models.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates sensor staleness, enhancing robustness in autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Motivation: Gaze in egocentric videos reflects visual attention and human intention, making it valuable for enhancing query-based video localization.

Method: Proposes GazeNLQ, using contrastive learning for gaze estimation from video, then augmenting video representations for better localization.

Result: Achieves R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively.

Conclusion: GazeNLQ effectively utilizes gaze to improve natural language query-based video retrieval, with code publicly available.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)
Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's
perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that
reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and
cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which
leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves
R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based framework for real-time audio-driven portrait video generation addresses computational challenges with variable-length generation, consistency training, quantization, and pipeline parallelism, achieving high FPS and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are expressive but computationally heavy, limiting real-time interactive avatar applications. The paper aims to overcome these constraints for seamless, high-fidelity video generation.

Method: Proposes variable-length video generation, consistency training for fast few-step generation, model quantization, pipeline parallelism, and a tailored inference strategy for stability. Also uses class labels for state transitions and fine-grained facial control.

Result: Achieves up to 78 FPS at 384x384 and 45 FPS at 512x512, with initial latency of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively, enabling fluid two-way communication.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances real-time performance and high-fidelity output, making it viable for interactive avatar applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

*Ziwei Zhao,Zhixing Zhang,Yuhang Liu,Zhao Zhang,Haojun Yu,Dong Wang,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeformCL introduces a continuous representation for 3D blood vessel extraction using deformable centerlines, improving connectivity, noise robustness, and interaction over traditional discrete methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete representations like masks in 3D medical imaging often lead to fractures or fragments due to per-pixel classification limitations.

Method: DeformCL uses deformable centerlines with connected nodes and edges to capture spatial relationships, trained via a cascaded pipeline.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show DeformCL's effectiveness and superiority, validated by clinical visualization.

Conclusion: DeformCL outperforms traditional methods, offering clinical significance, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

*Quansong He,Xiangde Min,Kaishen Wang,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-scale feature fusion method for UNet-based medical image segmentation, addressing limitations in skip connections by treating them as discrete nodes and using an adaptive ODE method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip connections in UNet lack effective multi-scale feature interaction and rely on inefficient operations, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale feature fusion method using an adaptive ODE approach, treating skip connections as discrete nodes in an initial value problem.

Result: Experiments show improved feature utilization, fewer parameters, and high performance on medical segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: The method enhances UNet's skip connections, is architecture-agnostic, and achieves better results without increasing complexity.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

*Marcin Kowalczyk,Tomasz Kryjak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hardware architecture (DIF filter) for noise reduction in event vision sensors, implemented on FPGA, achieving high throughput and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event vision sensors produce noisy data streams affected by illumination and temperature. Existing solutions lack efficiency in handling noise across varying conditions.

Method: Developed the DIF filter, implemented it on FPGA, and evaluated it using a new high-resolution event dataset.

Result: Achieved throughputs of 403.39 MEPS (1280x720) and 428.45 MEPS (640x480), with AUROC scores of 0.844-0.999, matching state-of-the-art performance but with higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The DIF filter offers superior throughput and noise-handling capabilities, making it a viable solution for event vision applications.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

*Myungkyu Koo,Subin Kim,Sangkyung Kwak,Jaehyun Nam,Seojin Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FontAdapter enables fast, high-quality font customization for unseen fonts using a two-stage curriculum learning approach, avoiding costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adapting unseen fonts are slow and impractical for real-time use, requiring expensive fine-tuning.

Method: FontAdapter uses a two-stage curriculum: first learning font attributes from glyphs, then integrating styles into backgrounds. Synthetic datasets support each stage.

Result: FontAdapter achieves robust font customization without additional fine-tuning, supporting text editing, style blending, and cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: FontAdapter is a versatile, efficient framework for font customization tasks, outperforming existing methods in speed and generalization.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Motivation: To address the challenge of object correspondence between ego and exo views by leveraging multimodal data and improving robustness to viewpoint changes.

Method: Proposes a multimodal condition fusion module for enhanced object localization and a cross-view object alignment module for consistency across perspectives.

Result: Ranked second on the Ego-Exo4D object correspondence benchmark.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the domain gap between ego and exo views, demonstrating strong performance in object segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChronoTailor is a diffusion-based framework for video virtual try-on, ensuring temporal consistency and fine-grained garment details through spatio-temporal attention and multi-scale feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video virtual try-on methods struggle with continuity and detail preservation. ChronoTailor addresses these challenges by improving spatio-temporal consistency and garment detail reproduction.

Method: ChronoTailor uses region-aware spatial guidance and attention-driven temporal feature fusion for local editing and artifact reduction. It integrates multi-scale garment features and garment-pose alignment for detail preservation and temporal continuity.

Result: Experiments show ChronoTailor outperforms previous methods in maintaining spatio-temporal continuity and preserving garment details during motion.

Conclusion: ChronoTailor advances video virtual try-on by combining spatio-temporal attention and multi-scale feature integration, validated by superior performance and a new dataset, StyleDress.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method (SPAT) using 32 images under distinct lighting to improve wheal detection in allergy tests, outperforming single-image baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance consistency and accuracy in diagnosing inhalant allergies by leveraging multiple images under varied lighting conditions.

Method: A two-part approach: neural network segmentation of wheals followed by algorithmic delineation, using manually annotated data from 868 patients.

Result: The method, tested on 217 patients, showed higher accuracy with 32 SPAT images compared to single-image baselines.

Conclusion: Utilizing multiple images under varied lighting significantly improves wheal detection accuracy in allergy diagnosis.

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CryoFastAR is a geometric foundation model for fast pose estimation in cryo-EM, outperforming traditional iterative methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation in cryo-EM relies on slow iterative optimization due to noise and distortions. CryoFastAR aims to address this by enabling direct pose prediction.

Method: CryoFastAR integrates multi-view features and uses progressive training on simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations.

Result: The model achieves comparable quality to traditional methods while significantly speeding up inference on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: CryoFastAR demonstrates the potential of geometric foundation models to revolutionize cryo-EM pose estimation and reconstruction.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: Domain-RAG is a retrieval-guided framework for generating domain-aligned images in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD), improving performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like copy-paste or text-to-image generation struggle with visual realism and domain alignment in CD-FSOD.

Method: Domain-RAG uses domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided generation, and foreground-background composition to create realistic, aligned images.

Result: Domain-RAG outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results in CD-FSOD and related tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-RAG is an effective, training-free solution for generating domain-consistent samples in CD-FSOD.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: To enhance autonomous driving by integrating high-level intent generation with low-level control, inspired by cognitive fast-slow architectures.

Method: Uses selective five-view prompting, multi-stage chain-of-thought reasoning, and spline-based trajectory post-processing.

Result: Achieved a Rater Feedback Score of 7.7367, ranking 2nd in the 2025 Waymo Challenge, outperforming the baseline by 2.77%.

Conclusion: HMVLM's upgrades effectively improve driving performance, balancing high-level planning with real-time control.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSCL, a method for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation by enhancing fine-grained consistency perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained consistency analysis, leading to unreliable fake news detection.

Method: CSCL uses two branches (image and text) with CCD and SCD decoders to capture contextual and semantic consistency.

Result: CSCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on DGM4 datasets, especially in grounding manipulated content.

Conclusion: CSCL improves fake news detection by leveraging fine-grained consistency learning.

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved transformer-based model (Mask2Former with deformable attention) for medical image segmentation, addressing challenges like high computational demands and poor performance on small organs. It achieves SOTA results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation is crucial for clinical applications but faces challenges like high computational costs and unsatisfactory performance on small organs. Transformer-based models, while effective globally, struggle with these issues.

Method: The authors enhance Mask2Former with deformable attention and offset adjustment strategies to better sample compact regions. They also use the 4th feature map for coarse organ location and an FCN-based auxiliary head for faster training with Dice loss.

Result: The model achieves SOTA performance on HaNSeg and SegRap2023 datasets, particularly for mid-sized and small organs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of transformer-based models in medical segmentation, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for semi-supervised segmentation focus only on accuracy, ignoring reliability and robustness, which are crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose RSS, a metric combining predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality via harmonic mean, penalizing deficiencies in any component.

Result: Evaluations show semi-supervised methods often sacrifice reliability for accuracy, with UniMatchV2 demonstrating robustness but still facing reliability issues.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised segmentation research with real-world deployment needs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

### [344] [FADE: Frequency-Aware Diffusion Model Factorization for Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05934)
*Yixuan Zhu,Haolin Wang,Shilin Ma,Wenliang Zhao,Yansong Tang,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FADE is a training-free video editing method leveraging pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization for high-quality, temporally coherent edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models struggle with efficient editing due to computational demands, and image diffusion models fail to handle video dynamics like motion adjustments.

Method: Analyzes attention patterns in video models, proposes factorization for component optimization, and uses spectrum-guided modulation for refined sampling.

Result: Delivers high-quality, realistic, and temporally coherent editing results in experiments.

Conclusion: FADE effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering efficient and versatile video editing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

*Dongjie Fu,Tengjiao Sun,Pengcheng Fang,Xiaohao Cai,Hansung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOGO introduces an efficient autoregressive framework for real-time 3D motion generation, combining MoSA-VQ for compact motion representation and RQHC-Transformer for low-latency token generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving high fidelity, real-time responsiveness, and scalability in transformer-based text-to-motion generation.

Method: Proposes MOGO with MoSA-VQ for hierarchical motion discretization and RQHC-Transformer for efficient token generation, plus a text condition alignment mechanism.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generation quality, real-time performance, streaming, and zero-shot generalization on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MOGO successfully balances quality and efficiency, advancing real-time motion generation with scalable and responsive solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

*Mingrui Li,Yiming Zhou,Hongxing Zhou,Xinggang Hu,Florian Roemer,Hongyu Wang,Ahmad Osman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dy3DGS-SLAM is a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input, outperforming existing RGB-D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM methods struggle with dynamic environments, especially with pure RGB input. Dy3DGS-SLAM aims to address this gap.

Method: Uses fused dynamic masks (optical flow + depth) and a motion loss for tracking. Employs rendering loss for mapping to handle dynamic interference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic scenes, matching or surpassing RGB-D methods.

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM effectively handles dynamic environments with monocular RGB input, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

TL;DR: The paper reviews Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques to address domain shifts in agricultural image analysis, improving model generalization across regions and seasons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in agricultural imagery due to environmental differences and data acquisition methods hinder model generalization, motivating the use of DA.

Method: The paper systematically reviews DA methods, categorizing them into shallow and deep learning models, and further into supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches, with a focus on adversarial learning.

Result: DA enhances performance in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, improving cross-domain transferability.

Conclusion: The review provides a framework for researchers, highlighting current gaps and supporting advancements in DA for agricultural image analysis.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

*Zonglin Wu,Yule Xue,Xin Wei,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCA-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating CAPTCHA security across diverse modalities, using fine-tuned cracking agents to assess vulnerabilities and propose design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a standardized, large-scale benchmark for evaluating CAPTCHA robustness across different modalities motivates the creation of MCA-Bench.

Method: MCA-Bench integrates various CAPTCHA types into a single protocol, using a shared vision-language model backbone to fine-tune specialized cracking agents for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show MCA-Bench effectively identifies vulnerabilities in CAPTCHAs and provides the first quantitative analysis of challenge complexity, interaction depth, and solvability.

Conclusion: The paper proposes actionable design principles and open challenges to improve CAPTCHA security, benchmarking, and community collaboration.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

*Yifu Qiu,Yftah Ziser,Anna Korhonen,Shay B. Cohen,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning vision-and-language foundation models for dynamics models is easier than for world models. Dynamics models can bootstrap world models via weakly supervised learning and inference-time verification, improving action-centric image editing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether vision-and-language models can realistically model world dynamics (observation-action-observation) and dynamics (observation-observation-action) when actions are language-based.

Method: Fine-tune models for dynamics models, then use them to bootstrap world models through weakly supervised learning (annotating actions for unlabelled data) and inference-time verification (scoring world model samples). A new objective weights image tokens by importance.

Result: The best model achieves competitive performance in action-centric image editing, improving by 15% on real-world subsets and excelling in human evaluations.

Conclusion: Dynamics models are easier to acquire and can effectively bootstrap world models, leading to improved performance in tasks like image editing.

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid ML and pretrained DL approach improves Orthopoxvirus classification from medical images, offering efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diagnostic methods are slow and require expertise, and existing datasets are limited and biased, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Combines Machine Learning with pretrained Deep Learning models for feature extraction without data augmentation.

Result: Achieves high classification performance with computational efficiency and strong generalization across evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new pipeline for stereo video generation and enhancement, outperforming existing methods by fine-tuning on degraded data and using warped masks for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on high-quality monocular inputs, lacking solutions for low-quality videos and consistent stereo generation.

Method: Fine-tuning on degraded data for restoration and conditioning on warped masks for consistent stereo video generation.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines stereo generation and restoration, applicable to real-world low-quality videos.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

### [353] [Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027)
*Yuhao Sun,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Chaowei Xiao,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSNI, a framework for sample-specific noise injection in diffusion-based purification, improving accuracy and robustness by adapting noise levels based on score norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DBP methods use a constant noise level for all samples, but the paper finds that optimal noise levels vary per sample, motivating the need for adaptive noise injection.

Method: SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate deviations from clean data (score norms) and adjusts noise levels per sample via a reweighting function.

Result: SSNI improves accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K when integrated with existing DBP methods.

Conclusion: Sample-specific noise injection is crucial for DBP methods, and SSNI effectively achieves this, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR, a novel method using two adapters (AutoKL and CLIP), reconstructs complex visual stimuli from fMRI data by combining topological and semantic information, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately reconstructing highly complex visual stimuli from fMRI data due to their density, diversity, and semantic complexity.

Method: HAVIR employs two adapters: AutoKL for topological structures and CLIP for semantic information, fused by Versatile Diffusion. CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions and synthesized images.

Result: HAVIR effectively reconstructs structural and semantic features of visual stimuli, even in complex scenarios, surpassing current models.

Conclusion: HAVIR bridges neuroscience and computer vision by improving the reconstruction of complex visual stimuli from brain activity.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

*Joscha Diehl,Rasheed Ibraheem,Leonard Schmitz,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel tensor-to-tensor layer (FIS) with linear cost is proposed for processing high-dimensional data, achieving competitive performance in classification and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data (e.g., images, tensors) requires efficient subquadratic processing layers, addressing limitations in existing methods.

Method: Utilizes 'corner trees' and a multiparameter generalization of iterated integrals to create the FIS layer, integrating seamlessly with other layers.

Result: Achieves similar accuracy to larger ResNet models with fewer parameters and operations; anomaly detection model scores 97.3% AUROC on MVTec AD.

Conclusion: The FIS layer is a scalable, efficient solution for tensor processing, validated in practical tasks.

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDS-Net, a dual-branch CNN for infrared small target detection, addressing feature heterogeneity and inefficient fusion to improve accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IRSTD methods inefficiently handle shallow-deep feature collaboration and lack systematic fusion modeling, limiting performance and increasing computational costs.

Method: SDS-Net uses a dual-branch architecture to separately model structural and semantic features, with an adaptive fusion module for dynamic cross-layer correlation.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show SDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: SDS-Net achieves superior detection performance with low computational complexity, offering broad application potential.

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the reliability of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical image analysis under the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework, proposing full conformal adaptation and SS-Text to improve efficiency and maintain coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the discriminative potential of VLMs in medical image analysis, their reliability under SCP remains overlooked, especially given the limitations of zero-shot performance and few-shot transfer learning.

Method: The authors introduce full conformal adaptation, a transductive approach for adapting and conformalizing VLMs, and SS-Text, a training-free linear probe solver to reduce computational costs.

Result: Experiments with 3 medical VLMs and 9 tasks show consistent improvements of up to 27% in set efficiency while maintaining coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances VLM reliability in medical image analysis without additional data requirements, offering significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

Result: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5 VL 7B outperforms GPT-4o by 11.9% and 34.6% in stress and growth stage tasks.

Conclusion: WisWheat significantly improves VLM performance for wheat management, offering scalable, data-driven solutions.

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

*Koulischer Felix,Handke Florian,Deleu Johannes,Demeester Thomas,Ambrogioni Luca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FBG improves diffusion models by dynamically adjusting guidance based on sample needs, outperforming CFG and matching LIG on ImageNet512x512.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG's constant guidance harms diversity and induces memorization; FBG aims to self-regulate guidance adaptively.

Method: FBG uses a state-dependent coefficient to dynamically adjust guidance, derived from a linear corruption assumption of conditional distributions.

Result: FBG outperforms CFG on ImageNet512x512 and adapts guidance scales for complex vs. simple prompts in text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: FBG challenges fixed guidance, offering a mathematically grounded, adaptive alternative that integrates with existing schemes.

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

### [360] [CLaMR: Contextualized Late-Interaction for Multimodal Content Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06144)
*David Wan,Han Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Jaemin Cho,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLaMR is a multimodal retriever that dynamically selects relevant modalities for video content retrieval, outperforming single- and multi-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval systems treat video modalities independently, leading to noisy results. CLaMR aims to improve retrieval by dynamically leveraging the most relevant modalities.

Method: CLaMR jointly indexes four modalities (video frames, speech, on-screen text, metadata) using a unified backbone. It introduces MultiVENT 2.0++ for training and a modality-aware loss.

Result: CLaMR outperforms baselines, improving nDCG@10 by 25.6 over single-modality and 35.4 over multi-modality retrievers. It also boosts performance in downstream tasks like long-video QA.

Conclusion: CLaMR demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic modality selection and joint training for multimodal video retrieval.

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

### [361] [VideoChat-A1: Thinking with Long Videos by Chain-of-Shot Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06097)
*Zikang Wang,Boyu Chen,Zhengrong Yue,Yi Wang,Yu Qiao,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoChat-A1 introduces a novel agent paradigm for long video understanding, using chain-of-shot reasoning to mimic human-like analysis of relevant shots, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long video understanding due to redundant or noisy context retrieval, lacking deep shot-level analysis.

Method: VideoChat-A1 employs a chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm, progressively selecting and analyzing relevant shots in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (77.0 on VideoMME, 70.1 on EgoSchema), outperforming baselines by up to 10.8% and 6.2%.

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1 effectively mimics human thinking for long video understanding, offering competitive accuracy with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

*Zhanwen Liu,Huanna Song,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shangyu Xie,Yisheng An,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BiLIE, a framework for low-light image enhancement using event cameras, addressing noise and structural issues with novel modules and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional cameras and existing event-guided methods in low-light conditions by addressing global noise and local structural discontinuities.

Method: Introduces Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) for noise suppression and Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) for smoother representations, alongside a new dataset (RELIE).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Conclusion: BiLIE effectively enhances low-light images by addressing key challenges, validated by superior performance metrics.

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCLSTM, a lightweight convolutional architecture for predicting dynamic agents' future states in autonomous driving, outperforming transformer-based methods without relying on vectorized inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting agent states in autonomous driving rely on high-quality vectorized inputs and computationally heavy transformers, which are impractical.

Method: Proposes Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM), a lightweight, end-to-end trainable architecture using convolutional operations to capture temporal and spatial dynamics.

Result: CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and ranks first in the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge.

Conclusion: CCLSTM provides a practical and efficient solution for predicting agent states, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

### [364] [A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155)
*Wenyuan Li,Shunlin Liang,Yuxiang Zhang,Liqin Liu,Keyan Chen,Yongzhe Chen,Han Ma,Jianglei Xu,Yichuan Ma,Shikang Guan,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H2Crop, a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset combining EnMAP hyperspectral data and Sentinel-2 time series, and proposes a dual-stream Transformer for fine-grained crop classification, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained crop classification is essential for precision agriculture and food security but faces challenges due to limited hyperspectral data and high annotation costs.

Method: A dual-stream Transformer architecture processes hyperspectral EnMAP data (spectral-spatial Transformer) and Sentinel-2 time series (temporal Swin Transformer), with hierarchical fusion for multi-level classification.

Result: Adding hyperspectral data improves F1-scores by 4.2% on average (up to 6.3%), outperforming existing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The H2Crop dataset and proposed method advance fine-grained crop classification, demonstrating the value of hyperspectral data in remote sensing.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MF$^2$, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to comprehend and recall key narrative details from full-length movies, highlighting their current shortcomings compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for VLMs focus on superficial details or use semi-automated questions, failing to assess deep comprehension of long-form video content.

Method: MF$^2$ includes 50+ full-length movies with manually constructed claim pairs (true vs. false) targeting core narrative elements, evaluated via binary claim identification.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly worse than humans, revealing their inability to retain and reason over critical narrative information.

Conclusion: The MF$^2$ benchmark exposes VLMs' limitations in holistic video understanding, emphasizing the gap between human and model capabilities.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing broader error types (beyond procedural) in real-time video analysis for domains like industrial automation and education.

Method: Introduces a framework detecting procedural and execution errors, using LLMs for feedback generation.

Result: Ranked second on the HoloAssist benchmark for mistake detection.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects diverse errors and provides explanatory feedback, proving practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large
language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the
HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, stability, and generalization on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks.

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula bridges data-driven learning and physical understanding, enabling interpretable modeling of environmental variables.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral

for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and

TL;DR: STSBench is a framework to benchmark vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving, introducing STSnu to evaluate spatio-temporal reasoning on the NuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of spatio-temporal reasoning in VLMs for autonomous driving, focusing instead on simpler tasks like object recognition.

Method: STSBench mines traffic scenarios from datasets, provides human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for evaluation.

Result: STSnu reveals critical shortcomings in VLMs' spatio-temporal reasoning, with 971 questions across 43 scenarios.

Conclusion: STSBench highlights the need for architectural advances in VLMs to improve spatio-temporal reasoning for autonomous driving.

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), a task for multi-round image search based on mental images, and proposes GenIR, a generative retrieval method using diffusion models for clear feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between VLMs' success in benchmarks and real-world applications, where human search is multi-round and guided by mental images.

Method: GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm using diffusion-based image generation to provide explicit visual feedback.

Result: GenIR outperforms existing interactive methods in MIR, demonstrated through experimental results.

Conclusion: The work establishes MIR as a new task with a dataset and effective method, paving the way for future research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' capabilities in endoscopic tasks, focusing on laparoscopic surgery, and compare specialized medical VLMs with generalist models.

Method: Used diverse state-of-the-art models, surgical datasets, and human annotations to evaluate VLMs on basic and advanced tasks.

Result: VLMs excel in basic tasks like object counting but falter with medical knowledge. Specialized medical VLMs perform worse than generalist models.

Conclusion: Further advancements are needed to optimize VLMs for surgical environments, highlighting key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

TL;DR: Optimized GeoTIFF loading configurations boost remote data throughput by 20x and local by 4x, matching local training accuracy and improving GPU utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PyTorch data loaders underutilize GPUs when streaming GeoTIFF files from cloud storage, necessitating optimized solutions for petabyte-scale Earth observation data.

Method: Benchmarked GeoTIFF loading from cloud and local SSD, tested loader configurations (tile-aligned reads, worker thread pools), and used Bayesian optimization for optimal settings.

Result: Achieved 20x remote and 4x local throughput improvements, matched local training accuracy, and improved GPU utilization (85-95% vs. 0-30%).

Conclusion: Optimized configurations enable efficient deep learning on large-scale EO data, maintaining accuracy and GPU utilization while reducing bottlenecks.

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote

*Zahra Babaiee,Peyman M. Kiasari,Daniela Rus,Radu Grosu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Visual Graph Arena (VGA) to evaluate AI's ability for visual abstraction, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of 'conceptualization'—AI's ability to recognize and reason about concepts despite visual variations—a key human reasoning skill.

Method: VGA uses six graph-based tasks with diverse layouts to test representation-invariant reasoning. State-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs are evaluated.

Result: Humans achieved near-perfect accuracy, while models failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks, indicating pseudo-intelligent pattern matching.

Conclusion: VGA highlights fundamental AI limitations in visual understanding and provides a framework to advance human-like conceptualization in AI.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

TL;DR: A survey on video understanding from egocentric and exocentric perspectives, covering applications, research tasks, advancements, datasets, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the synergistic potential of combining egocentric and exocentric perspectives for richer video understanding, mimicking human cognition.

Method: Systematically reviews advancements in three directions: leveraging egocentric data for exocentric understanding, using exocentric data for egocentric analysis, and joint learning frameworks.

Result: Identifies key tasks, benchmarks, and limitations, proposing future research to advance video understanding.

Conclusion: Aims to inspire progress in AI by integrating dual perspectives, bringing machines closer to human-like perception.

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

TL;DR: BecomingLit introduces a method for creating relightable, high-resolution head avatars using a low-cost light stage setup, a new dataset, and a hybrid neural shading approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to reconstruct relightable head avatars that can be rendered interactively from novel viewpoints, addressing limitations in existing methods.

Method: The approach involves a custom light stage setup, a dataset of multi-view sequences, a 3D Gaussian primitive representation, and a hybrid neural shading model combining neural diffuse BRDF with analytical specular terms.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in relighting and reenactment, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: BecomingLit successfully achieves high-quality relightable avatars with improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

TL;DR: STARFlow is a scalable generative model using Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow) for high-resolution image synthesis, combining normalizing flows and autoregressive transformers with architectural innovations for scalability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scaling normalizing flows for high-resolution image synthesis while maintaining performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduces TARFlow, a deep-shallow Transformer design, latent space modeling, and a novel guidance algorithm for scalability and quality.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in class- and text-conditional image generation, nearing state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Conclusion: STARFlow is the first successful large-scale normalizing flow model for high-resolution image synthesis.

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a benchmark for evaluating nuanced, expert-level understanding of physical human skills in video-language models.

Method: ExAct includes 3521 expert-curated video QA pairs across 11 activities in 6 domains, with 5 candidate options per question.

Result: GPT-4o achieves 44.70% accuracy, significantly lower than human experts' 82.02%.

Conclusion: ExAct is a valuable tool for advancing VLMs in understanding human skills, with potential for future improvements.

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level
understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains
3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human
specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing
and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various
physical and procedural domains. Dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMemo introduces a dual-path architecture and RoPE-DHR positional encoding to improve multimodal processing in LVLMs, addressing attention neglect and 2D structural loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs, built on LLMs, suffer from attention neglect of middle visual content and loss of 2D spatial relationships in high-resolution images.

Method: Proposes CoMemo with a dual-path (Context and Memory paths) for visual processing and RoPE-DHR for preserving 2D spatial awareness.

Result: Outperforms conventional LVLMs in long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoMemo effectively addresses LVLM limitations, offering improved multimodal processing and performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

TL;DR: TerraFM is a scalable self-supervised learning model for Earth observation, leveraging Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to improve generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models lack scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity, limiting globally transferable representations.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning with radar and optical inputs, modality-specific embeddings, cross-attention fusion, and contrastive learning with dual-centering for long-tailed distributions.

Result: Outperforms prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench for classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: TerraFM demonstrates strong generalization and is publicly available for broader use.

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

*Ambrose Emmett-Iwaniw,Nathan Kirk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper studies predicting unobserved image parts from small pixel patches using an improved ConvNADE model, showing better results with low-discrepancy pixel patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image data rely on variable order, and the paper explores how observing small pixel patches can improve prediction of unobserved parts.

Method: Proposes a generalized, efficient ConvNADE model for real-valued and color images, testing random and low-discrepancy pixel patches.

Result: Low-discrepancy pixel patches reduce test loss and yield more realistic reconstructions compared to random patches.

Conclusion: Using low-discrepancy sequences for pixel selection improves autoregressive model performance in image reconstruction.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of registering histology and MSI due to their different image formation processes and dimensionalities.

Method: Uses a pix2pix model to synthesize histological images from MSI for unimodal registration.

Result: Preliminary results show improved synthetic histology images with higher mutual information (+0.924) and SSIM (+0.419) compared to a U-Net baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the registration challenge, with promising results and publicly available code.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for

TL;DR: FPDANet, a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network, is proposed to improve fetal ultrasound image classification by addressing ResNet's limitations in contextual correlation and feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet's unidirectional feature transfer and lack of contextual correlation are ineffective for fetal ultrasound images, which suffer from low contrast, high similarity, and noise.

Method: FPDANet introduces a positional attention mechanism (DAN) and a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) fusion module to enhance feature representation and capture contextual dependencies.

Result: FPDANet achieved 91.05% (Top-1) and 100% (Top-5) classification accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: FPDANet outperforms ResNet in fetal ultrasound image classification by leveraging contextual and multi-scale feature fusion.

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,

TL;DR: LinGuinE automates longitudinal lung tumour segmentation, improving Dice scores by over 20% on clinical and public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few solutions exist for automated longitudinal tumour segmentation, crucial for tracking chemotherapy response in lung cancer.

Method: LinGuinE uses radiologist input and rigid registration to propagate tumour points across CT scans, validated by a click classifier.

Result: LinGuinE improves segmentation accuracy (Dice score) by over 20% on two datasets, with statistical significance (p<0.05).

Conclusion: LinGuinE is effective for longitudinal tumour segmentation, works from any starting point, and outperforms alternatives.

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Motivation: Current datasets lack clinical and demographic diversity, hindering robust AI models for dermatology.

Method: Curated dataset (DermaCon-IN) with 5,450 images from 3,000 patients, annotated by dermatologists, and benchmarked using various AI architectures.

Result: Baseline performance established for multiple models, highlighting potential for interpretable and clinically realistic AI.

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN offers a scalable, representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in real-world settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a

assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

TL;DR: DermaCon-IN is a diverse dermatology dataset from South India, addressing gaps in AI diagnostics by capturing clinical and demographic complexity. It benchmarks multiple AI models for robust, equitable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack clinical and demographic diversity, hindering AI model robustness and equity in dermatology.

Method: Curated 5,450 clinical images from 3,000 patients in South India, annotated by dermatologists with 240 diagnoses. Benchmarked various AI architectures.

Result: Established baseline performance for models like ResNet, ViT, and Concept Bottleneck Models, integrating anatomical and concept-level cues.

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN offers a scalable, representative foundation for advancing equitable and interpretable dermatology AI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: QualitEye is a method for verifying image-based gaze data quality, addressing privacy concerns and enabling collaboration in gaze-based applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring data quality and privacy in large-scale gaze data collection is challenging, especially when collaboration is required.

Method: QualitEye uses a semantic representation of eye images for verification, adapting to public and privacy-preserving settings with private set intersection protocols.

Result: High verification performance on MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets with minimal runtime overhead for privacy-preserving versions.

Conclusion: QualitEye advances gaze analysis by integrating machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the healthcare challenge of chronic wounds by reducing resource-intensive traditional care and improving patient quality of life.

Method: Developed a patient-centered app with on-device wound segmentation (deep learning) and remote monitoring, iteratively designed with user feedback.

Result: High usability, good app quality, and positive AI recognition feedback from patients and dermatologists.

Conclusion: WoundAIssist effectively bridges patient-HCP gaps and offers design insights for remote monitoring apps.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

*Kieu Dang,Phung Lai,NhatHai Phan,Yelong Shen,Ruoming Jin,Abdallah Khreishah,My Thai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines watermarking techniques for LLMs to address model stealing risks, proposing a taxonomy, a classifier, and analyzing limitations and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs risks intellectual property violations and misuse, with model stealing being a critical threat. Current watermarking techniques are underdeveloped for real-world use.

Method: The study develops a taxonomy for LLM watermarks, proposes an intellectual property classifier, and evaluates watermark effectiveness in attack and attack-free scenarios.

Result: Experiments reveal that existing watermarks negatively impact LLM utility and downstream tasks, limiting their real-world potential.

Conclusion: Practical watermark solutions tailored for LLMs are needed, as current techniques fall short in deployment effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

*Yuan Xun,Siyuan Liang,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight defense framework, Robust Instruction Tuning, to protect large visual language models (LVLMs) from stealthy backdoor attacks during finetuning, without modifying core model weights or requiring prior attack knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks when finetuned with contaminated data, and existing defenses are unsuitable due to constraints like frozen model weights and lack of attack knowledge.

Method: The proposed method finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding layers, using two regularizations: Input Diversity Regularization and Anomalous Activation Regularization.

Result: The defense reduces attack success rates to nearly zero on Flickr30k and MSCOCO datasets, with minimal (less than 15%) increase in training cost.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates backdoor attacks in LVLMs by focusing on adapter-level tuning and leveraging complementary regularizations, without needing core model modifications or attack priors.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing accuracy decline and privacy concerns in federated learning for resource-constrained mobile devices with varying image quality.

Method: Trains local models for different quality levels, aggregates features with quality-weighted fusion, and incorporates differential privacy.

Result: Achieves 92.31% accuracy on MNIST, outperforming FedRolex (86.42%), and maintains 30.77% accuracy under privacy constraints.

Conclusion: QA-HFL effectively balances accuracy, privacy, and efficiency, with low-end devices playing a key role in model performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KITE, a framework to evaluate AI-human knowledge transfer, finding that benchmark performance doesn't consistently predict effective knowledge transfer, which requires dedicated optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI reasoning improvements lead to better human-understandable knowledge transfer.

Method: Introduces KITE, a framework for evaluating knowledge transfer, and conducts a large-scale human study (N=118) with a two-phase setup: collaborative ideation followed by independent solution implementation.

Result: Benchmark performance correlates with collaborative outcomes but is inconsistent, with outliers showing knowledge transfer requires specific optimization. Behavioral and strategic factors mediate success.

Conclusion: Knowledge transfer needs dedicated optimization beyond benchmark performance; the study provides tools (code, dataset, framework) for future work on communicatively aligned models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMTU, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs on expert-level table tasks, highlighting gaps in current evaluations and showing significant room for improvement in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for table-related tasks are limited and narrowly focused, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks faced by professional users.

Method: MMTU is introduced as a benchmark with over 30K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to evaluate models' ability to understand, reason, and manipulate tables.

Result: Frontier models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score around 60%, indicating challenges in table understanding, reasoning, and coding.

Conclusion: MMTU aims to drive advances in foundation models for structured data processing, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and

*Emmanuel Anaya Gonzalez,Sairam Vaidya,Kanghee Park,Ruyi Ji,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new MCMC-based constrained sampling framework for LMs ensures constraint satisfaction, convergence to the true distribution, and efficiency, outperforming existing methods in program fuzzing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained-decoding methods distort LM distributions, limiting diversity and validity in applications like program fuzzing.

Method: Proposes a constrained sampling framework using MCMC, with a proposal distribution over valid outputs and Metropolis-Hastings acceptance based on LM likelihood.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances constraint satisfaction, convergence, and efficiency, proving superior for diverse and valid sample generation.

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in developing real-time perceptual task guidance systems due to costly data collection and evaluation.

Method: Introduces a data curation pipeline for synthetic dialogues, automatic evaluation metrics, and an end-to-end model for streaming video processing.

Result: Created a large-scale synthetic dataset, validated metrics, and a model for context-aware responses.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for proactive AI assistants in task guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing
real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These
systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming
visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and
labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address
these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key
contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that
synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset,
a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This
work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaAgent is a personalized LLM agent framework with memory and action modules, outperforming baselines by aligning user preferences dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack flexibility for user-specific needs, prompting the development of PersonaAgent for personalized tasks.

Method: Integrates personalized memory (episodic/semantic) and action modules, with a persona prompt intermediary. Uses test-time alignment to optimize prompts via simulated interactions.

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines, effectively personalizing actions and scaling in real-world applications.

Conclusion: PersonaAgent demonstrates feasibility for tailored, dynamic user experiences, highlighting its potential.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KITE, a framework to evaluate AI-human knowledge transfer, finding that benchmark performance doesn't consistently predict successful transfer, highlighting the need for dedicated optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI reasoning improvements translate to better human-understandable knowledge transfer.

Method: Introduces KITE, a two-phase human study (N=118) where humans ideate with AI and then independently implement solutions to isolate AI explanations' impact.

Result: Benchmark performance correlates with outcomes but inconsistently, with outliers showing knowledge transfer requires specific optimization.

Conclusion: Successful knowledge transfer depends on behavioral and strategic factors, and dedicated optimization is needed beyond benchmark performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMTU is a large-scale benchmark for evaluating expert-level table-related tasks, highlighting gaps in current LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for table-related tasks are limited, focusing narrowly on NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, while real-world tasks for professionals remain unaddressed.

Method: MMTU introduces over 30K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, drawing from decades of research on tabular data.

Result: Frontier models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: MMTU aims to drive advances in foundation models for structured data processing, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and

TL;DR: A new MCMC-based constrained sampling framework for LMs ensures constraint satisfaction, convergence to the true distribution, and efficiency, outperforming existing methods in program fuzzing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained-decoding methods distort model distributions, limiting diversity and validity in applications like program fuzzing.

Method: Proposes a constrained sampling framework using MCMC, with a proposal distribution over valid outputs and Metropolis-Hastings acceptance based on LM likelihood.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances constraint satisfaction, convergence, and efficiency, proving superior in practical applications.

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing

TL;DR: MLM4HG introduces a Masked Language Modeling-based method to improve generalization in heterogeneous graph learning by converting graphs to metapath-based texts and unifying tasks into a cloze-style paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs struggle with generalization across domains and tasks, and integrating them with LLMs introduces biases due to embedding disparities. MLM4HG addresses these limitations.

Method: MLM4HG converts heterogeneous graphs to metapath-based textual sequences, unifies tasks with cloze-style templates, and fine-tunes a pretrained LM with constrained vocabulary.

Result: MLM4HG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain and multi-task experiments, showing superior generalization in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: MLM4HG effectively leverages textual sequences and unified task templates to enhance generalization in heterogeneous graph learning, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over
state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

Motivation: To address the challenge of precisely controlling neural activity noninvasively, especially in deep brain regions, without affecting nearby neurons.

Method: Using perturbations on natural visual feeds to modulate neural activity in the primate ventral visual stream, tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations.

Result: Quantitative agreement between model predictions and biological effects, enabling targeted neural modulation and injection of experimenter-chosen patterns.

Conclusion: Machine-executable models can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered neural interventions at single-neuron resolution.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the

neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such
as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to
the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their

TL;DR: ODE-GS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ODEs to forecast dynamic 3D scenes beyond training time, outperforming existing methods in extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering systems fail at predicting future scenes due to time embedding limitations. ODE-GS aims to overcome this by leveraging continuous-time latent dynamics.

Method: ODE-GS uses a frozen time-conditioned deformation model and a Transformer encoder to summarize past trajectories into a latent state, evolved by a neural ODE for future predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving LPIPS error on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Continuous-time latent dynamics enable photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes, proving practical and powerful.

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

TL;DR: SurGSplat is a novel method for 3D reconstruction in endoscopic surgery, addressing challenges like sparse features and lighting by refining 3D Gaussian Splatting with geometric constraints. It improves surgical navigation with better visual clarity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Structure-from-Motion methods often fail in endoscopic scenarios due to sparse features and inconsistent lighting, necessitating a more robust solution for surgical navigation.

Method: SurGSplat progressively refines 3D Gaussian Splatting by integrating geometric constraints, enabling detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and critical features.

Result: SurGSplat outperforms in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy, proving to be a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: SurGSplat offers a reliable and precise method for 3D reconstruction in endoscopic surgery, enhancing intraoperative decision-making and safety.

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

*Daniel Wang,Patrick Rim,Tian Tian,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ODE-GS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ODEs to forecast dynamic 3D scenes beyond training time, outperforming existing methods in extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering systems fail at predicting future scenes due to time dependency. ODE-GS aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging continuous-time latent dynamics.

Method: ODE-GS uses a frozen time-conditioned deformation model and a Transformer encoder to summarize past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state, evolved by a neural ODE. It includes a variational objective and a second-derivative regularizer.

Result: ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving LPIPS error on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Continuous-time latent dynamics enable photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes, making ODE-GS a powerful and practical solution.

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

*Yuchao Zheng,Jianing Zhang,Guochen Ning,Hongen Liao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SurGSplat improves 3D reconstruction in endoscopic surgeries by refining 3D Gaussian Splatting with geometric constraints, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SfM-based methods fail in endoscopic scenarios due to sparse features and inconsistent lighting, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: SurGSplat progressively refines 3D Gaussian Splatting by integrating geometric constraints for detailed reconstruction of vascular structures.

Result: SurGSplat excels in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, offering high-fidelity surgical scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: SurGSplat is an efficient and accurate solution for intraoperative navigation, enhancing surgical decision-making.

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

TL;DR: A technique maps parameters from a large Transformer to a smaller, task-specific model, improving performance for specialized tasks while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Foundation Models (FMs) are computationally expensive and contain irrelevant knowledge for specific tasks, making them impractical for consumer devices.

Method: The method involves transforming parameters of a large Transformer into those of a smaller, specialized model tailored to a specific task.

Result: The smaller, task-specific models outperform universal conditional models in image modeling tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully narrows the knowledge scope for specific tasks, enabling efficient and effective smaller models.

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

### [420] [BAQ: Efficient Bit Allocation Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05664)
*Chao Zhang,Li Wang,Samson Lasaulce,Merouane Debbah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BAQ, a novel framework for nonuniform bitwidth allocation in post-training quantization of LLMs, using Hessian-derived sensitivity metrics and convex optimization to minimize quantization loss. BAQ outperforms GPTQ, achieving up to 56× lower perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods use uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments, ignoring nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization noise. This limits efficiency and performance.

Method: The framework derives sensitivity metrics from a Hessian proxy, formulates bit allocation as a convex optimization problem, and solves it for closed-form solutions. The BAQ algorithm exploits insights like the equal-loss structure.

Result: BAQ outperforms GPTQ, achieving up to 56× lower perplexity at the same bitwidth across LLMs (125M to 30B parameters).

Conclusion: BAQ provides an efficient, theoretically grounded solution for bit allocation in quantization, with minimal overhead and significant performance gains.

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

### [421] [Contextually Guided Transformers via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05672)
*Andrey Zhmoginov,Jihwan Lee,Max Vladymyrov,Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) that eliminates explicit prompts by encoding context into model weights, enabling self-specialization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational overhead from prompts in LLMs by integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Method: Proposes CGT, which maintains contextual summaries at each sequence position, updating weights dynamically based on context.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic tasks and benchmarks, with improved interpretability of contextual representations.

Conclusion: CGT offers a novel, efficient approach for adaptable language modeling by embedding context into the architecture.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Table-r1, a two-stage program-based table reasoning method, improves small language models' performance by addressing layout heterogeneity and reasoning inconsistency, achieving competitive results with large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) struggle with table reasoning due to limited capacity compared to large models. Program-based TR (P-TR) offers a solution but introduces challenges like layout heterogeneity and reasoning inconsistency.

Method: Table-r1 uses a two-stage approach: (1) self-supervised Layout Transformation Inference for layout generalization, and (2) mix-paradigm Group Relative Policy Optimization for consistent reasoning with dynamic fallback to text-based TR.

Result: Table-r1 outperforms SLM-based methods, improving accuracy by at least 15% over LLaMA-8B and matching large model performance on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Table-r1 effectively bridges the gap between SLMs and LLMs in table reasoning, demonstrating robust performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

*Tianyi Alex Qiu,Zhonghao He,Tejasveer Chugh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) create a feedback loop with humans, reinforcing existing beliefs and reducing diversity, potentially locking in false beliefs. Empirical tests confirm this hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs reinforce human beliefs through feedback loops, leading to reduced diversity and potential false belief lock-in.

Method: Formalized the hypothesis and tested it using agent-based LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data.

Result: Analysis showed sustained drops in diversity after new GPT releases, supporting the feedback loop hypothesis.

Conclusion: The human-AI feedback loop entrenches existing beliefs, reducing diversity and risking false belief lock-in.

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

TL;DR: Proposes Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT) to reduce error accumulation in autoregressive models by revisiting and replacing past tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models suffer from fixed left-to-right token generation, leading to error accumulation.

Method: Introduces RPT, which iteratively revisits and replaces tokens in a window of past text, compatible with existing models.

Result: Fine-tuning with RPT improved reasoning and coding benchmarks by ~10% over standard sampling.

Conclusion: RPT effectively mitigates error accumulation without compromising model quality or speed.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

*Shuangqi Li,Hieu Le,Jingyi Xu,Mathieu Salzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for data attribution in generative models by learning parameter importance weights, improving accuracy and providing fine-grained insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify influential training examples for outputs, addressing limitations of uniform parameter treatment in existing methods.

Method: Learns parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, adapting to model structure without labeled data.

Result: Improves attribution accuracy in diffusion models and reveals detailed contributions of training data to outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances attribution by capturing semantic aspects, offering deeper insights into data influence.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DataSeeds.AI's sample dataset (DSD), emphasizing a shift from model-centric to data-centric AI development, and demonstrates its impact on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the importance of high-quality, well-annotated training data in improving AI model performance, moving beyond traditional model-centric approaches.

Method: Introduces the DSD dataset (10,610 high-quality images with annotations) and evaluates its impact on model performance against benchmarks.

Result: Quantitative improvements in model performance are documented, with code and trained models made publicly available.

Conclusion: The DSD dataset sets a new standard for commercial image datasets, supporting scalable and robust AI development.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

*Dumindu Tissera,Omar Awadallah,Muhammad Umair Danish,Ayan Sadhu,Katarina Grolinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a redesigned loss function for Multi-label Classification (MLC) to handle datasets with large negative data, improving performance without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative data in MLC datasets can overwhelm learning and hinder accurate classification, especially in applications like defect detection and healthcare.

Method: The authors derive a likelihood of any class being present using a normalized weighted geometric mean of predicted probabilities, introducing a regularization parameter to balance absent class contributions.

Result: Experiments on datasets like SewerML and ChestX-ray14 show performance gains up to 6.01% in F1, 8.06% in F2, and 3.11% in mean average precision.

Conclusion: The proposed loss function enhances MLC by improving awareness of implicit positive instances and label classification, with no extra computational cost.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

TL;DR: The paper evaluates loss functions in neural architecture search (NAS) performance predictors, categorizing them into regression, ranking, and weighted types, and finds combining them improves NAS efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of thorough investigation into the effectiveness and characteristics of loss functions in NAS performance predictors, which are crucial for reducing evaluation costs.

Method: The study assesses eight loss functions using NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks across five search spaces, categorizing them into regression, ranking, and weighted types.

Result: Combining specific loss function categories enhances predictor-based NAS, and practical guidance for selecting loss functions for various tasks is provided.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for developing loss functions in NAS, aiding the community in optimizing performance predictors.

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

TL;DR: A novel test-time optimization method improves uncertainty estimation by addressing noisy classifier weights, enhancing confidence estimates and outperforming standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques like dropout fail to clearly distinguish reliable predictions due to noisy classifier weights.

Method: Proposes a test-time optimization method accounting for noise impact, defining a monotonic subset-selection function for better confidence estimates.

Result: Superior performance in risk-based metrics (AUSE, AURC), identifies distribution discrepancies, and differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves uncertainty estimation, highlights classifier differences, and enhances reliability in predictions.

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM-GS, a gradient surgery method for multi-task deep learning, addressing conflicting gradients via similarity-aware momentum and gradient equalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning (MTL) faces challenges with conflicting gradients during backpropagation, which degrade training. This work aims to improve gradient handling for better convergence.

Method: Proposes SAM-GS, a gradient surgery method using gradient magnitude similarity to adjust gradients and modulate momentum, ensuring balanced optimization.

Result: SAM-GS shows effectiveness in synthetic problems and MTL benchmarks, improving gradient aggregation and learning optimization.

Conclusion: SAM-GS successfully regularizes gradient conflicts in MTDL, enhancing training stability and convergence through similarity-aware adjustments.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEC, a framework to compare and align feature embeddings by analyzing clustering mismatches using kernel matrices and eigendecomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparisons of feature embeddings focus on numerical performance, but interpretable analysis of clustering differences is lacking.

Method: SPEC examines kernel matrices from embeddings, uses eigendecomposition to detect clustering mismatches, and optimizes alignment between embeddings.

Result: SPEC scales linearly with sample size and is demonstrated on large datasets like ImageNet and MS-COCO.

Conclusion: SPEC provides a scalable, interpretable method to compare and align embeddings, addressing clustering mismatches effectively.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

*Andrey Zhmoginov,Jihwan Lee,Max Vladymyrov,Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) that eliminates explicit prompts by encoding context into model weights, enabling self-specialization and efficient language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational overhead from prompt reliance in LLMs and enhance adaptability by integrating context directly into the model.

Method: Proposes CGT, which maintains a contextual summary at each sequence position to dynamically update weights based on preceding context.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic tasks and benchmarks, with improved interpretability of contextual representations.

Conclusion: CGT offers a novel, efficient approach for adaptable language modeling by embedding context into the architecture.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

*Rihui Jin,Zheyu Xin,Xing Xie,Zuoyi Li,Guilin Qi,Yongrui Chen,Xinbang Dai,Tongtong Wu,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Table-r1, a two-stage program-based table reasoning method for small language models (SLMs), improves accuracy by 15% over LLaMA-8B and competes with large LMs by addressing layout heterogeneity and reasoning inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between small and large language models in table reasoning by addressing limitations of text-based methods, especially in numerical reasoning.

Method: Proposes Table-r1: Stage 1 uses self-supervised Layout Transformation Inference for layout generalization; Stage 2 employs a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization for consistent reasoning with fallback to text-based TR.

Result: Outperforms all SLM-based methods, achieving at least 15% accuracy improvement over LLaMA-8B and competitive performance with large LMs.

Conclusion: Table-r1 effectively enhances SLMs' table reasoning capabilities, narrowing the gap with LLMs.

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

*Tianyi Alex Qiu,Zhonghao He,Tejasveer Chugh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) create a feedback loop with humans, reinforcing existing beliefs and reducing diversity, potentially locking in false beliefs. Empirical tests confirm this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of LLM-human feedback loops on belief reinforcement and diversity loss.

Method: Formal hypothesis testing using agent-based LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data.

Result: Sudden, sustained drops in diversity after new GPT releases, supporting the feedback loop hypothesis.

Conclusion: LLM-human feedback loops entrench existing beliefs, reducing diversity and risking false belief lock-in.

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT) to reduce error accumulation in autoregressive models by iteratively revisiting and replacing past tokens, improving performance by ~10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models suffer from fixed left-to-right token generation, leading to error accumulation.

Method: Introduces RPT, which revisits and replaces tokens in a window of past text, compatible with existing models.

Result: Fine-tuning with RPT improved reasoning and coding benchmarks by ~10% over standard sampling.

Conclusion: RPT effectively mitigates error accumulation without compromising model speed or quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

*Shuangqi Li,Hieu Le,Jingyi Xu,Mathieu Salzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method for data attribution in generative models by learning parameter importance weights, improving accuracy and providing fine-grained insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all network parameters uniformly, ignoring layer-specific information contributions.

Method: Learns parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, adapting to model structure without labeled data.

Result: Improves attribution accuracy in diffusion models and offers detailed insights into training data influence.

Conclusion: The method enhances understanding of how outputs borrow from training data by capturing semantic aspects.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DataSeeds.AI's sample dataset (DSD), a high-quality, annotated dataset for AI training, advocating a shift from model-centric to data-centric approaches in AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight the importance of data quality and structure in improving AI model performance, moving away from traditional model-centric methods.

Method: The method involves creating and evaluating the DSD, a dataset of 10,610 high-quality images with multi-tier annotations, and comparing its impact on model performance against benchmarks.

Result: The DSD demonstrates quantitative improvements in model performance, setting a new standard for commercial image datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the DSD's potential to enhance AI development by prioritizing data quality and scalability, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

*Dumindu Tissera,Omar Awadallah,Muhammad Umair Danish,Ayan Sadhu,Katarina Grolinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a redesigned loss function for multi-label classification (MLC) to handle datasets with large negative data, improving performance without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large proportions of negative data in MLC datasets can overwhelm learning and hinder accurate classification of positive instances.

Method: The authors derive a likelihood of any class being present using a normalized weighted geometric mean of predicted probabilities, introducing a regularization parameter to control the impact of absent class probabilities.

Result: Experiments on datasets like SewerML, COCO, and ChestX-ray14 show performance gains up to 6.01% in F1, 8.06% in F2, and 3.11% in mean average precision.

Conclusion: The proposed loss function enhances MLC performance by improving awareness of implicit positive instances and label classification, without extra parameters or computational cost.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

TL;DR: The paper evaluates loss functions in neural architecture search (NAS) performance predictors, categorizing them into regression, ranking, and weighted types, and finds combining them improves NAS efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high evaluation costs in NAS by improving performance predictors, focusing on the understudied impact of loss functions.

Method: Assessed eight loss functions across 13 tasks in five NAS search spaces, using NAS-relevant metrics.

Result: Combining specific loss function categories enhances predictor-based NAS, offering practical guidance for task-specific selections.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for developing loss functions in NAS performance predictors, aiding the NAS community.

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

TL;DR: A novel test-time optimization method improves uncertainty estimation by addressing noisy classifier weights, enhancing reliability in confidence estimates and outperforming standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques like dropout fail to clearly distinguish reliable predictions due to noisy classifier weights.

Method: Proposes a test-time optimization method that accounts for noise in classifier weights to produce more reliable confidence estimates.

Result: The method outperforms in risk-based metrics (AUSE, AURC), identifies distribution discrepancies, and differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The approach enhances uncertainty estimation, clarifies CNN vs. ViT classifier differences, and improves reliability in confidence scores.

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

*Thomas Borsani,Andrea Rosani,Giuseppe Nicosia,Giuseppe Di Fatta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM-GS, a gradient surgery method for multi-task deep learning, addressing conflicting gradients by using gradient magnitude similarity to improve optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting gradients in multi-task deep learning hinder convergence, requiring methods to manage gradient interference.

Method: SAM-GS uses gradient magnitude similarity for equalization and momentum modulation to guide optimization.

Result: Experiments show SAM-GS's effectiveness on synthetic problems and MTL benchmarks.

Conclusion: Gradient magnitude similarity is key for optimizing gradient aggregation in MTDL.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEC, a framework to compare and align feature embeddings by analyzing clustering mismatches using kernel matrices and eigendecomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparisons of feature embeddings focus on numerical performance, but lack interpretability in identifying clustering mismatches.

Method: SPEC uses kernel matrices and eigendecomposition to detect differences in clustering between embeddings, with a scalable implementation. It also introduces an optimization problem for alignment.

Result: SPEC is applied to large-scale datasets like ImageNet and MS-COCO, demonstrating its effectiveness in comparing and aligning embeddings.

Conclusion: SPEC provides an interpretable and scalable method for comparing and aligning feature embeddings, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

TL;DR: A text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs is proposed, enabling domain adaptation without additional audio, preserving speech-text alignment, and achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Speech LLMs to new domains is challenging, especially in low-resource settings with scarce paired speech-text data.

Method: Text-only fine-tuning using unpaired target-domain text, with a real-time evaluation mechanism to maintain speech-text alignment.

Result: Competitive recognition performance on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical datasets, with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Text-only fine-tuning is effective for low-resource domain adaptation of ASR, improving generalization without catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) are used as judges to evaluate speaking styles in speeches generated by spoken language models (SLMs), showing promising agreement with human evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of ALLMs in evaluating speaking styles (e.g., emotion, pace) in speeches generated by SLMs, and compare their performance with human judges.

Method: Four SLMs generate speeches for two tasks (voice style instruction following and role-playing). ALLMs (GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro) and humans judge the SLMs' responses.

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro's agreement with human judges is comparable to human evaluator agreement, indicating ALLMs' potential as judges. SLMs, including GPT-4o-audio, still need improvement in style control and dialogue naturalness.

Conclusion: ALLMs can effectively judge speaking styles in SLM-generated speeches, though SLMs require further refinement for better style control and dialogue quality.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

*Yun-Shao Tsai,Yi-Cheng Lin,Huang-Cheng Chou,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: CO-VADA is a debiasing method for speech emotion recognition (SER) that uses voice conversion to mitigate bias without model changes or demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in SER systems arises from spurious correlations between speaker traits and emotions, causing unfair predictions. Existing debiasing methods are often impractical due to model-specific requirements or reliance on demographic annotations.

Method: CO-VADA identifies biased training samples, applies voice conversion to alter irrelevant attributes, and generates augmented samples with varied speaker traits to reduce bias.

Result: The approach improves fairness in SER systems without modifying model architecture or needing demographic information.

Conclusion: CO-VADA is a scalable and practical solution for debiasing SER systems, compatible with various models and voice conversion tools.

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

### [450] [Low-Resource Domain Adaptation for Speech LLMs via Text-Only Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05671)
*Yangui Fang,Jing Peng,Xu Li,Yu Xi,Chengwei Zhang,Guohui Zhong,Kai Yu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs enables domain adaptation without additional audio, maintaining performance and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Speech LLMs to new domains is challenging, especially with scarce paired speech-text data.

Method: Proposes text-only fine-tuning using unpaired target-domain text and a real-time evaluation mechanism to preserve alignment.

Result: Achieves competitive recognition performance with minimal degradation and improves generalization to new domains.

Conclusion: Text-only fine-tuning is effective for low-resource domain adaptation in ASR, avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

### [451] [Audio-Aware Large Language Models as Judges for Speaking Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05984)
*Cheng-Han Chiang,Xiaofei Wang,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Linjie Li,Radu Kopetz,Yao Qian,Zhendong Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Hung-yi Lee,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using Audio-aware Large Language Models (ALLMs) as judges to evaluate speaking styles in speeches generated by Spoken Language Models (SLMs), showing promising agreement with human judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether ALLMs can effectively evaluate the speaking styles (e.g., emotion, pace) of speeches generated by SLMs, reducing reliance on human judges.

Method: ALLMs (GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro) and humans evaluate SLMs' performances on voice style instruction following and role-playing tasks.

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro's evaluations align closely with human judges, indicating ALLMs' potential as reliable evaluators. However, SLMs, including GPT-4o-audio, still struggle with precise style control.

Conclusion: ALLMs can serve as effective judges for SLMs, though SLMs need further improvement in generating natural dialogues and controlling speaking styles.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

### [453] [Object Navigation with Structure-Semantic Reasoning-Based Multi-level Map and Multimodal Decision-Making LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05896)
*Chongshang Yan,Jiaxuan He,Delun Li,Yi Yang,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an active object navigation framework (EAM and MHR) to improve zero-shot object navigation by leveraging scene information and hierarchical reasoning, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) struggles with performance due to ignored high-dimensional scene information and long-range target searching.

Method: Uses Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) for scene mapping and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning (MHR) for efficient frontier exploration.

Result: EAM achieves 64.5% scene mapping accuracy; navigation improves SPL by 21.4% (HM3D) and 46.0% (MP3D) over baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses ZSON challenges, enhancing success rates and efficiency.

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D flow world model, ManiFlow-110k, to teach robots manipulation skills by predicting object movements in 3D space, enabling cross-embodiment adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle with manipulation tasks due to lack of large, uniform datasets. Humans understand tasks via 3D object movement, which is embodiment-agnostic.

Method: A 3D optical flow dataset is synthesized, and a video diffusion-based world model learns manipulation physics. Flow-guided rendering and GPT-4o assess alignment with task descriptions.

Result: The model generalizes well across tasks and adapts reliably to different robots without hardware-specific training.

Conclusion: The 3D flow world model effectively bridges the gap in robot manipulation learning, enabling robust and unified action representation.

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and mitigating unsafe behaviors in LLMs by linking interpretation techniques to safety improvements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces IaCGen, an LLM-based framework for generating deployable Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates, and DPIaC-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating deployability. While initial LLM performance was poor, IaCGen improved success rates significantly, though challenges in user intent alignment and security compliance remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in current IaC generation evaluations, which focus on syntactic correctness but ignore deployability, a critical measure of utility.

Method: Developed IaCGen, an LLM-based framework with iterative feedback, and DPIaC-Eval, a benchmark with 153 real-world scenarios to evaluate syntax, deployment, intent, and security.

Result: Initial LLM performance was low (30.2% and 26.8% deployment success), but IaCGen boosted success rates to over 90%, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7 reaching 98%. Challenges persist in intent alignment (25.2%) and security (8.4%).

Conclusion: The work provides the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC generation, setting a foundation for future research while highlighting unresolved challenges.

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template

Motivation: Competitive programming is key for evaluating LLMs, but test cases are scarce. High-quality test cases are crucial for accurate evaluation.

Method: An LLM-based agent system generates test cases, applied to create CodeContests+ from CodeContests.

Result: CodeContests+ shows higher accuracy, especially in True Positive Rate, and benefits LLM reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Improved test case quality enhances evaluation accuracy and LLM training, validating the LLM-based agent system.

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale

the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further

*Keinichi Fujita,Shota Horiguchi,Yusuke Ijima*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A method for controlling voice impressions in zero-shot TTS using a low-dimensional vector, validated by objective and subjective evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modulating para-/non-linguistic information in speech to control voice impressions is challenging in zero-shot TTS.

Method: Uses a low-dimensional vector to represent voice impression intensities and generates it via a large language model from natural language descriptions.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in impression control through evaluations.

Conclusion: Eliminates manual optimization, enabling target-impression generation from natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and leverage the implicit context dependency in CTC's ILM, despite its label context independence assumption.

Method: Proposes context-dependent ILM estimation via knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications and introduces two KD regularization methods.

Result: Context-dependent ILMs outperform context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation, with label-level KD with smoothing achieving over 13% relative WER improvement.

Conclusion: CTC learns a context-dependent ILM, and the proposed methods effectively estimate and enhance it, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Motivation: Modulating para-/non-linguistic information in zero-shot TTS to control perceived voice characteristics is challenging.

Method: Uses a low-dimensional vector to represent voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright) and generates this vector via a large language model.

Result: Effective impression control demonstrated through evaluations.

Conclusion: Eliminates manual optimization by enabling target-impression generation from natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.
