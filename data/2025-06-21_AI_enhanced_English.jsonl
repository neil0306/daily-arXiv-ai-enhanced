Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged\nas a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid\nin diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage\nmulti-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.\n  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal\nclinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a\nnovel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND\nclassification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion\nTensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our\nframework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within\nvolumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted\nfeature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically\nintegrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.\nComprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate\nthat our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,\nparticularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework\nachieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\\%, outperforming baseline methods by\nover 10\\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying\nmulti-modal learning to real-world clinical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "A transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework is proposed to enhance neurological disorder diagnosis by integrating multi-modal MRI and clinical data, achieving 82.47% accuracy.", "motivation": "Existing DL methods fail to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal diagnostic performance for neurological disorders.", "method": "A novel transformer-based MoE framework is introduced, utilizing multiple MRI modalities (aMRI, DTI, fMRI) and clinical data.
