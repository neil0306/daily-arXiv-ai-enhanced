### [1] [Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning Over Ordered Procedural Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04688)
*Adrita Anika,Md Messal Monem Miah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with reconstructing globally ordered sequences from shuffled procedural steps, especially with longer sequences and more severe shuffling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' capability in reasoning over procedural sequences where step order directly impacts outcomes, using food recipes as a domain where correct sequencing is essential.

Method: Evaluated several LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings using a curated dataset of food recipes, with metrics including Kendall's Tau, NLCS, and NED to capture ordering quality.

Result: Model performance declines with increasing sequence length and greater step displacement in input, showing limitations in procedural reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in procedural reasoning tasks, particularly when dealing with longer sequences and more disordered inputs.

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

### [2] [Adaptive Testing for LLM Evaluation: A Psychometric Alternative to Static Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04689)
*Peiyu Li,Xiuxiu Tang,Si Chen,Ying Cheng,Ronald Metoyer,Ting Hua,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATLAS is an adaptive testing framework that uses Item Response Theory to reduce LLM evaluation costs by 90% while maintaining precision, revealing annotation errors in benchmarks and showing that IRT-based rankings differ significantly from traditional accuracy rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM evaluation is expensive and slow due to thousands of benchmark items, treats all items equally despite varying quality, and may be corrupted by annotation errors in static benchmarks.

Method: Uses Item Response Theory (IRT) with Fisher information-guided item selection to adaptively choose the most informative items for model ability estimation, reducing the number of items needed.

Result: Achieves 90% item reduction while maintaining measurement precision (0.154 MAE on HellaSwag with only 42 items vs 5,608 full benchmark). Reveals 3-6% of items have negative discrimination (annotation errors). IRT rankings differ from accuracy rankings, with 23-31% of models shifting by more than 10 rank positions.

Conclusion: ATLAS provides a more efficient and accurate evaluation framework that exposes flaws in static benchmarks and enables better model differentiation through adaptive testing.

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).
Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with
the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by
more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at

### [3] [SARC: Sentiment-Augmented Deep Role Clustering for Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04692)
*Jingqing Wang,Jiaxing Shang,Rong Xu,Fei Hao,Tianjin Huang,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SARC is a sentiment-augmented role clustering framework that improves fake news detection by identifying user roles through sentiment-enhanced deep clustering and joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detection methods treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals without considering that the same sentiment polarity may come from users with different roles, limiting their ability to capture nuanced detection patterns.

Method: The framework generates user features through joint comment text representation (BiGRU + Attention) and sentiment encoding, constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to categorize user roles, and uses a joint optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection.

Result: Experimental results on RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp datasets show SARC achieves superior performance across all metrics compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: SARC effectively addresses role differentiation in sentiment analysis for fake news detection and demonstrates improved performance through joint optimization of role clustering and detection tasks.

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social
networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from
both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,
existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,
overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may
originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to
capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we
propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes
sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake
news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint
comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment
encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to
automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which
take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint
optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to
further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior
performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is

### [4] [Reasoning Up the Instruction Ladder for Controllable Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04694)
*Zishuo Zheng,Vidhisha Balachandran,Chan Young Park,Faeze Brahman,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes training LLMs to reason about instruction hierarchies, enabling them to prioritize system instructions over user inputs, which improves reliability and safety against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs take on high-stakes roles, they need to reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (developers, users, tools) within a single prompt context. Enforcing an instruction hierarchy is critical for reliability and controllability.

Method: Reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Construct VerIH dataset with aligned/conflicting system-user instructions. Use lightweight reinforcement learning to transfer general reasoning capabilities to instruction prioritization.

Result: Finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and hierarchy benchmarks. The reasoning ability generalizes to safety-critical settings, enhancing robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,
domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models
demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro
F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup
(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline
classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including
Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues
that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression
from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned
transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,
while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and
human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as
a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental
health platforms.

### [8] [Separate the Wheat from the Chaff: Winnowing Down Divergent Views in Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04700)
*Song Wang,Zihan Chen,Peng Wang,Zhepei Wei,Zhen Tan,Yu Meng,Cong Shen,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WinnowRAG is a novel RAG framework that systematically filters out noisy documents while preserving valuable content through query-aware clustering and iterative winnowing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in RAG systems where increasing retrieved documents introduces noise that reduces response accuracy, while still benefiting from more comprehensive information retrieval.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage I performs query-aware clustering and assigns each cluster to an LLM agent; Stage II uses a critic LLM to evaluate agent outputs and iteratively separate useful documents from noisy ones with strategic merging techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate WinnowRAG's effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: WinnowRAG provides a model-agnostic solution that improves RAG performance without requiring fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in
accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase
the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of
retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce
significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby
reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the
challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose
WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy
documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as
winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware
clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each
cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage
II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of
multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To
retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic
merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for
generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does
not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.
Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess construct validity of LLM benchmarks for measuring abstract phenomena like safety and robustness, which is crucial before deployment.

Method: Conducted systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading NLP/ML conferences with 29 expert reviewers, analyzing patterns in measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics.

Result: Found patterns that undermine validity of claims about safety and robustness in LLM benchmarks across reviewed articles.

Conclusion: Provides 8 key recommendations and detailed actionable guidance for researchers and practitioners to improve LLM benchmark development.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial for both assessing their
capabilities and identifying safety or robustness issues prior to deployment.
Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and
'robustness' requires strong construct validity, that is, having measures that
represent what matters to the phenomenon. With a team of 29 expert reviewers,
we conduct a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading conferences
in natural language processing and machine learning. Across the reviewed
articles, we find patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and
scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the resulting claims. To
address these shortcomings, we provide eight key recommendations and detailed
actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners in developing LLM
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POLIS-Bench is the first systematic evaluation suite for LLMs in governmental bilingual policy scenarios, featuring an up-to-date bilingual corpus, scenario-grounded tasks, and dual-metric evaluation. It reveals reasoning models' superiority and enables cost-effective fine-tuned models that match proprietary baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous evaluation benchmarks for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios, ensuring relevance to current governance practice and comprehensive assessment of model understanding and application.

Method: Constructed an extensive up-to-date bilingual policy corpus, designed three scenario-grounded tasks (Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, Compliance Judgment), and established a dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy rate.

Result: Evaluation of 10+ state-of-the-art LLMs revealed reasoning models maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, with compliance tasks being particularly challenging. Fine-tuned lightweight POLIS series models achieved parity with or surpassed proprietary baselines on multiple policy subtasks at significantly reduced cost.

Conclusion: POLIS-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for policy-oriented LLMs, demonstrating that fine-tuned lightweight models can achieve competitive performance for real-world governmental deployment, offering a cost-effective and compliant solution.

Abstract: We introduce POLIS-Bench, the first rigorous, systematic evaluation suite
designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios.
Compared to existing benchmarks, POLIS-Bench introduces three major
advancements. (i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive,
up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment
sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii)
Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded
tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the
Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and
application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel
dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy
rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement
adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on
POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models
maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the
difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we
successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS
series models achieves parity with, or surpasses, strong proprietary baselines
on multiple policy subtasks at a significantly reduced cost, providing a
cost-effective and compliant path for robust real-world governmental
deployment.

### [12] [First is Not Really Better Than Last: Evaluating Layer Choice and Aggregation Strategies in Language Model Data Influence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04715)
*Dmytro Vitel,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges prior findings that embedding layers are best for LLM influence estimation, showing middle attention layers are better and proposing improved aggregation methods and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training sample influence estimation in LLMs by addressing unreliable cancellation effects and developing better layer selection and aggregation methods.

Method: Proposed theoretical and empirical analysis of cancellation effect reliability, evaluated middle attention layers for influence estimation, developed alternative aggregation methods (ranking, vote-based), and introduced Noise Detection Rate (NDR) metric.

Result: Middle attention layers outperform first layers for influence estimation; alternative aggregation methods significantly improve performance; NDR metric shows strong predictive capability compared to cancellation effect.

Conclusion: First layers are not necessarily better than last layers for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge, and middle attention layers with improved aggregation methods provide better influence estimation.

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

*Ha Young Kim,Jun Li,Ana Beatriz Solana,Carolin M. Pirkl,Benedikt Wiestler,Julia A. Schnabel,Cosmin I. Bercea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RADAR is a retrieval-augmented agentic system that improves rare disease detection in brain MRI by using AI agents to retrieve relevant medical literature and case reports, achieving up to 10.2% performance gain without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often fail for rare diseases due to scarce training data, mirroring how radiologists consult literature when encountering unfamiliar findings.

Method: Uses AI agents with sentence transformers to embed case reports and literature, indexes with FAISS for efficient similarity search, and retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decisions.

Result: Achieves up to 10.2% performance gain on NOVA dataset with 280 rare diseases, with strongest improvements for open source models like DeepSeek, while providing interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented reasoning is a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging, improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence
conditions in medical imaging.

### [14] [Surprisal reveals diversity gaps in image captioning and different scorers change the story](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04754)
*Nikolai Ilinykh,Simon Dobnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces surprisal variance as a metric for linguistic diversity in image captioning, showing that human captions have higher diversity than models when measured with caption-trained LM, but the pattern reverses with general-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning and address the limitations of existing evaluation methods that rely on single scorers.

Method: Measure surprisal variance (spread of token-level negative log-probabilities) across five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs and human captions on MSCOCO test set, using both caption-trained n-gram LM and general-language model scorers.

Result: Human captions show roughly twice the surprisal variance of models with caption-trained LM, but this pattern reverses when using general-language model scorers.

Conclusion: Relying on a single scorer can completely invert diversity conclusions, so robust evaluation must report surprisal under multiple scorers.

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance
- the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On
the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs,
decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a
caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ERPO framework addresses the problem of residual prompts in RLVR training by encouraging exploration on prompts with zero variance rewards, reactivating their training signals through adaptive temperature sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts with zero variance rewards, reducing training diversity and effectiveness.

Method: ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct responses, encouraging diverse reasoning traces.

Result: Empirical results on Qwen2.5 series show ERPO consistently surpasses strong baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ERPO effectively exploits residual prompts in RLVR training, improving model performance by reactivating training signals through exploration.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

### [16] [Trained on Tokens, Calibrated on Concepts: The Emergence of Semantic Calibration in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04869)
*Preetum Nakkiran,Arwen Bradley,Adam Goliński,Eugene Ndiaye,Michael Kirchhof,Sinead Williamson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Base LLMs exhibit semantic calibration in open-domain QA tasks despite not being trained for it, but RL instruction-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning systematically break this calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether base LLMs can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond token-level calibration, and to explain why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing B-calibration mechanism connecting calibration to local loss optimality, plus experimental validation across question-answering tasks testing predictions about semantic calibration emergence and breakdown.

Result: Base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated semantically, but RL instruction-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning systematically break this calibration.

Conclusion: Semantic calibration emerges naturally in base LLMs through next-token prediction mechanisms, providing the first principled explanation of when and why this occurs, with important implications for model training and reasoning techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

### [17] [Minimal and Mechanistic Conditions for Behavioral Self-Awareness in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04875)
*Matthew Bozoukov,Matthew Nguyen,Shubkarman Singh,Bart Bussmann,Patrick Leask*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can develop behavioral self-awareness through simple finetuning, which manifests as linear features that can be easily induced and controlled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the minimal conditions for LLM self-awareness emergence and the mechanisms behind it, addressing safety concerns about models potentially concealing their true abilities.

Method: Controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs using low-rank adapters (LoRA), specifically testing with single rank-1 LoRA adapters.

Result: Self-awareness can be reliably induced with single rank-1 LoRA, captured by a single steering vector in activation space, and is non-universal with independent representations across tasks.

Conclusion: Behavioral self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated, suggesting simple mechanistic processes.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

### [18] [SDS KoPub VDR: A Benchmark Dataset for Visual Document Retrieval in Korean Public Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04910)
*Jaehoon Lee,Sohyun Kim,Wanggeun Park,Geon Lee,Seungkyung Kim,Minyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDS KoPub VDR is the first large-scale benchmark for Korean public document retrieval, featuring 361 real-world documents with complex visual elements and 600 human-verified query-page-answer triples across six public domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VDR benchmarks overlook non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications, creating a critical gap for evaluating document retrieval systems in real-world scenarios.

Method: Built a corpus of 361 real-world Korean documents (40,781 pages) with complex visual elements. Created 600 query-page-answer triples using multimodal models followed by rigorous human verification. Categorized queries by reasoning modality (text-based, visual-based, cross-modal).

Result: Evaluation revealed substantial performance gaps, particularly in multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art models. The benchmark enables fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR serves as a foundational resource that provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world document intelligence, addressing the limitations of existing English-centric benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

*Chandra Vamsi Krishna Alla,Harish Naidu Gaddam,Manohar Kommi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BudgetMem is a memory-augmented architecture that selectively stores information under strict budget constraints, achieving near-baseline performance with 72.4% memory savings on long documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face computational and memory constraints when processing long contexts, making current approaches with extended context windows prohibitively expensive for resource-constrained deployments.

Method: Combines selective memory policies with feature-based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) and learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access.

Result: Achieves only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG on long documents (5K-10K tokens), with benefits increasing with document length.

Conclusion: Provides a practical pathway for deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access to advanced language understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

*Yu Li,Lehui Li,Qingmin Liao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for baseline and dataset recommendation that uses collective perception from citation networks to improve experimental design automation, achieving significant performance gains over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for dataset and baseline recommendation suffer from limited data coverage (missing datasets actually used in papers) and overreliance on content similarity, which overlooks experimental suitability.

Method: 1) Automated pipeline linking papers to their actual datasets/baselines; 2) Collective perception retriever using citation contexts; 3) Reasoning-augmented reranker with explicit reasoning chains and LLM-based justifications.

Result: Covers 85% of datasets/baselines from top AI conferences; outperforms strongest baseline by +5.85% Recall@20 and +8.30% HitRate@5.

Conclusion: The approach advances reliable, interpretable automation of experimental design through comprehensive data coverage and collective perception.

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric
tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging
capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM
agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is
to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.
However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation
datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many
datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content
similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks
experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the
baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for
baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated
data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted
papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a
collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each
dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates
self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient
candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.
Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction
chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language
model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset
we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences
over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the
strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in
HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable
automation of experimental design.

*Shixiong Zhao,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes taxonomic inconsistencies in Wikidata, proposes a validation method to identify classification errors, and develops a system for users to inspect and potentially correct these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata's open editing policy has led to taxonomic inconsistencies despite being the largest open knowledge graph, which affects its reliability as a central resource for knowledge graph research and user access.

Method: Proposes a novel validation method to detect classification errors, over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific Wikidata domains, along with a new evaluation criterion for determining correction necessity.

Result: Confirmed presence of taxonomic inconsistencies in Wikidata and developed a system that enables users to inspect taxonomic relationships of arbitrary entities, leveraging Wikidata's crowdsourced nature.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies taxonomic issues in Wikidata and provides tools for community-driven correction, enhancing the platform's reliability while maintaining its open, collaborative nature.

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

*Wei Shao,Lingchao Zheng,Pengyu Wang,Peizhen Zheng,Jun Li,Yuwei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoPT is a lossless parallel tokenization framework that eliminates boundary artifacts in long text processing while maintaining identical output to sequential tokenization, achieving significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long context inference introduces computational latency, and existing parallel tokenization methods suffer from inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts when merging segmented text.

Method: Uses character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment to align and merge tokenized segments accurately without boundary artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments show LoPT achieves significant speedup while guaranteeing lossless tokenization identical to sequential processing.

Conclusion: LoPT provides a robust solution for parallel tokenization that is both fast and lossless, with theoretical proof of consistency and comprehensive validation.

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large
language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While
prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

*Zihao Yi,Qingxuan Jiang,Ruotian Ma,Xingyu Chen,Qu Yang,Mengru Wang,Fanghua Ye,Ying Shen,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li,Linus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to authentically role-play villainous characters due to safety alignment conflicts, with performance declining as character morality decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs' safety alignment affects their ability to simulate morally ambiguous or villainous fictional characters, which is important for creative applications.

Method: Created Moral RolePlay benchmark with four-level moral alignment scale, tested state-of-the-art LLMs on role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains.

Result: Models show consistent decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases, struggle with traits like "Deceitful" and "Manipulative", and substitute nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental tension between model safety and creative fidelity, highlighting the need for more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

*Ya Wang,Guangzheng Zhu,Cungen Cao,Jingjing Li,He Li,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to automatically generate and filter large-scale Chinese emotional events using LLMs and trained filters, creating the first comprehensive Chinese emotional events knowledge base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional events are valuable for applications but difficult to acquire, especially context-independent common emotional events in Chinese language.

Method: Collect Chinese emotional event indicators, use LLM to generate events, train filter to remove invalid results, and classify events as positive/negative using different techniques.

Result: Created a knowledge base of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment labels - the only large-scale Chinese emotional events resource.

Conclusion: The method effectively acquires Chinese emotional events and shows strong potential for emotion cause extraction applications.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional
events will be released after the publication of this paper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBSUITE is an evaluation suite that tests LLMs' ability to follow diverse behavioral policies in multi-turn conversations, revealing that current models fail significantly under adversarial conditions despite good single-turn performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM applications occur in organizational contexts with specific policies and regulations, requiring models to adapt to diverse alignment goals rather than universal safety principles.

Method: Developed PBSUITE with 300 realistic behavioral policies across 30 industries and a dynamic evaluation framework to stress-test model compliance in adversarial multi-turn conversations.

Result: LLMs show strong adherence in single-turn settings (<4% failure rates) but compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates).

Conclusion: Current alignment methods are insufficient for enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world interactions, highlighting the need for robust context-aware alignment techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

Method: Created benchmark with 500 problems from Eolymp platform across 5 complexity levels, evaluated 13 leading models generating Python solutions via one-shot prompting in dedicated Eolymp environment with hidden tests.

Result: Even top-performing models like OpenAI o3 and GPT-5 solve only 50% of problems, highlighting challenges in code generation for low-resource languages. Comprehensive analysis includes performance across difficulty levels, solution uniqueness, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Demonstrates value of competitive programming benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in underrepresented languages and paves way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models.

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource
languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on
widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language
understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark
established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and
competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark
comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five
complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading
proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a
one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against
hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even
top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the
problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural
language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of
performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of
solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time
and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work
demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating
large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves
the way for future research on multilingual code generation and
reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code

*Jinglin Liang,Jin Zhong,Shuangping Huang,Yunqing Hu,Huiyuan Zhang,Huifang Li,Lixin Fan,Hanlin Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that context aggregation patterns across different Language Models share significant similarities through Order-Level Attention (OLA), and proposes a training-free adapter transfer method (TOA) that leverages these commonalities to enhance performance of unseen LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze commonalities in context aggregation patterns across multiple Language Models, which previous works lacked by focusing on individual models or attention heads. Understanding these commonalities can deepen LM understanding and enable cross-model knowledge transfer.

Method: Introduces Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout, discovers implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge, and proposes Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA) - a training-free cross-LM adapter that treats OLA as unified syntactic feature representation.

Result: OLA at the same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities, and TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances the performance of unseen LMs without requiring parameter updates, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The discovered commonalities in OLA across LMs enable effective cross-model knowledge transfer through the proposed TOA method, providing a unified approach to enhance LM performance by leveraging shared syntactic feature representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: A multilingual claim normalization system that transforms noisy social media posts into verifiable statements across 20 languages using systematic decomposition with Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How questions, achieving strong cross-lingual transfer despite English-only training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of multilingual misinformation detection by normalizing noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable claims across multiple languages, enabling more effective fact-checking and misinformation detection systems.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen3-14B using LoRA with systematic decomposition of posts using 6W questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How), incorporating intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for semantic alignment, and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual examples during inference.

Result: Achieved METEOR scores ranging from 41.16 (English) to 15.21 (Marathi), secured third rank on English leaderboard and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi, with 41.3% relative improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective cross-lingual generalization for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across diverse linguistic structures, showing that systematic decomposition enables robust cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data.

Abstract: We address claim normalization for multilingual misinformation detection -
transforming noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable statements across
20 languages. The key contribution demonstrates how systematic decomposition of
posts using Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions enables robust
cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data. Our
methodology incorporates finetuning Qwen3-14B using LoRA with the provided
dataset after intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for
semantic alignment and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual
examples during inference. Our system achieves METEOR scores ranging from 41.16
(English) to 15.21 (Marathi), securing third rank on the English leaderboard
and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi. The approach shows 41.3% relative
improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over
existing methods. Results demonstrate effective cross-lingual generalization
for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across
diverse linguistic structures.

### [29] [On Text Simplification Metrics and General-Purpose LLMs for Accessible Health Information, and A Potential Architectural Advantage of The Instruction-Tuned LLM class](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05080)
*P. Bilha Githinji,Aikaterini Meilliou,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuned Mistral 24B outperforms reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B in biomedical text simplification, achieving better balance between readability and discourse fidelity with SARI score of 42.46 and BERTScore of 0.91.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable solutions to adapt complex scientific documents into plain language for public health information consumption, given challenges in balancing readability and content preservation.

Method: Comparative analysis of two LLM classes: instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, evaluated against human benchmarks using 21 metrics spanning readability, discourse fidelity, content safety, and distributional measures.

Result: Mistral showed tempered lexical simplification strategy with enhanced readability (SARI mean 42.46) and preserved human-level discourse (BERTScore 0.91), while QWen achieved readability but had significantly lower BERTScore (0.89) due to disconnect in balancing readability and accuracy.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs like Mistral 24B are better suited for text simplification, lexical support is key domain-adaptation issue, and there are functional redundancies among readability metrics that inform metric selection heuristics.

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

### [30] [Iterative Layer-wise Distillation for Efficient Compression of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05085)
*Grigory Kovalev,Mikhail Tikhomirov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An improved distillation method for LLMs that reduces model size by iteratively evaluating layer importance and removing less important layers, achieving 28 layers (2.47B parameters) with only 9.7% quality loss from original 36-layer Qwen2.5-3B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop compact LLMs that preserve high performance for deployment in resource-limited settings, addressing the need for efficient models while maintaining quality.

Method: Iterative layer importance assessment by measuring performance degradation when removing individual layers, combined with joint loss function training using KL divergence and mean squared error.

Result: Reduced Qwen2.5-3B from 36 to 28 layers (2.47B parameters) with 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with 18% loss. Found middle transformer layers contribute less to inference.

Conclusion: The iterative distillation and fine-tuning approach is effective for creating efficient models, demonstrating potential for resource-limited deployment while preserving performance.

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: Improved evolutionary prompt optimization with decomposed evolution steps, LLM-based verification, human feedback integration, and efficient evaluation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evolutionary prompt optimization approaches lack robust operators and efficient evaluation mechanisms.

Method: Decomposed evolution into distinct steps, introduced LLM-based judge for verification, integrated human feedback to refine evolutionary operator, and developed efficient evaluation strategies.

Result: Approach improves both optimization quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements can partially generalize to prompt optimization in general, and code is released to enable prompt optimization on new tasks and facilitate further research.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

*Robin Armingaud,Romaric Besançon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManufactuBERT is a RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale, carefully deduplicated manufacturing corpus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on manufacturing NLP tasks while reducing training time by 33%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose Transformer encoders perform poorly in specialized domains like manufacturing due to lack of domain-specific terminology and semantics exposure.

Method: Created a comprehensive data processing pipeline with domain-specific filtering and multi-stage deduplication, then continually pretrained RoBERTa on the curated manufacturing corpus.

Result: ManufactuBERT establishes new state-of-the-art on manufacturing NLP tasks and shows 33% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to non-deduplicated training.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides a reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other specialized domains, with the model and corpus being publicly released.

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at

### [33] [Mind the Gap... or Not? How Translation Errors and Evaluation Details Skew Multilingual Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05162)
*Jan-Thorsten Peter,David Vilar,Tobias Domhan,Dan Malkin,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that reported performance gaps in multilingual math benchmarks are largely due to translation errors in datasets and inconsistent answer extraction methods, not actual model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the claimed performance differences of LLMs across languages in math tasks, as current benchmarks suggest significant gaps between high- and low-resource languages.

Method: Analyzed the MGSM benchmark for translation errors, proposed automatic quality assurance for dataset validation, and provided recommendations for standardized answer extraction from LLM outputs.

Result: Found that translation errors in the benchmark data and inconsistent answer extraction methods were responsible for the reported performance gaps. After corrections, the language gap mostly disappeared.

Conclusion: The perceived multilingual performance gap in LLMs for math tasks is largely an artifact of dataset quality issues rather than true model limitations, highlighting the need for better dataset validation practices.

Abstract: Most current large language models (LLMs) support a wide variety of languages
in addition to English, including high-resource languages (e.g. German,
Chinese, French), as well as low-resource ones (e.g. Swahili, Telugu). In
addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains,
like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example
domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages.
Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap
in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat
against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages.
We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual
capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact
that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math
benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in
the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM
outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic
quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations
to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the
aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different
conclusions from our research. We additionally release the corrected dataset to
the community.

*Cong-Thanh Do,Rama Doddipatla,Kate Knill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances white-box knowledge distillation, improving smaller LLMs' reasoning capabilities on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Chain-of-Thought prompting can improve knowledge distillation from larger to smaller LLMs for better reasoning performance.

Method: White-box knowledge distillation experiments using Qwen and Llama2 model families with CoT data from CoT-Collection dataset.

Result: Distilled models achieved better average performance on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from BIG-Bench-Hard benchmark.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought plays a crucial role in enhancing white-box knowledge distillation effectiveness for reasoning capability transfer.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

*Zilong Li,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the low-resource problem of translating classical Chinese to Japanese using character-level annotation methods, proposing an LLM-based pipeline and showing that auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks improve sequence tagging performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the low-resource problem in translating classical Chinese to Japanese using traditional character annotation methods, and to adapt this ancient translation process to modern language technologies.

Method: Abstract the ancient translation process as sequence tagging tasks, introduce an LLM-based annotation pipeline, construct a new dataset from digitalized open-source translation data, and use auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks to improve training.

Result: Under low-resource settings, auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks promote sequence tagging training. LLMs achieve high scores in direct machine translation but struggle with character annotation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method can work as a supplement to LLMs, providing an effective approach for classical Chinese to Japanese translation in low-resource scenarios where LLMs alone are insufficient for character-level annotation tasks.

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating
around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and
fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

### [36] [Reflective Personalization Optimization: A Post-hoc Rewriting Framework for Black-Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05286)
*Teqi Hao,Xioayu Tan,Shaojie Shi,Yinghui Xu,Xihe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPO is a two-stage framework that decouples content generation from personalization, using a reflection module to rewrite generic responses to align with user preferences, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM personalization methods using context injection force models to handle both content generation and style alignment simultaneously, leading to trade-offs that compromise output quality and control.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Base model generates generic response, 2) Reflection module rewrites output to match user preferences using supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on LaMP benchmark show RPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by decoupling content generation from personalization.

Conclusion: Explicit response shaping through decoupled architecture is superior to implicit context injection, providing an efficient model-agnostic personalization layer for user-centric generation.

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned BERT model for analyzing narrative frames in podcasts by linking frames to specific entities, enabling better understanding of discourse trends in conversational media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Podcasts are important for shaping public opinion but their unscripted, conversational nature makes automated analysis challenging, as existing LLMs struggle with subtle narrative cues.

Method: Developed a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in conversations, then correlates frame labels with high-level topics.

Result: The approach more closely aligns with human judgment for messy conversational data and reveals systematic relationships between topics and narrative frames.

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for studying influence in digital media by connecting what is discussed (topics) with how it's presented (frames) in podcast narratives.

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that criminal behavior descriptions can be effectively extracted from Slovak court verdicts using advanced regular expressions and LLMs, achieving near-perfect accuracy when combined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Criminal justice data lacks detailed offense information, but continental European court verdicts contain rich behavioral descriptions that are currently unused.

Method: Used three approaches: baseline regular expressions, advanced regular expressions focusing on 'sparing' normalization, and LLM prompting with Gemini Flash 2.0.

Result: Advanced methods significantly outperformed baseline: 97% accuracy with advanced regex, 98.75% with LLMs, and 99.5% when combined. Human evaluation showed 90% match with human annotations vs 34.5% for baseline.

Conclusion: Both advanced regular expressions and LLMs are highly effective for extracting criminal behavior descriptions from court verdicts, with combined methods achieving near-perfect accuracy.

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench is the first large-scale multimodal benchmark for the Indian subcontinent, evaluating VLMs across 10 Indian languages and 13 cultural topics, revealing significant performance gaps in culturally diverse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VLM evaluation benchmarks are Western-centric, leaving gaps in understanding model performance in culturally diverse and multilingual contexts, particularly for the Indian subcontinent.

Method: Created a benchmark with ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 3 multimodal tasks (OCR, MMT, VQA) covering 10 Indian languages and English, with culturally grounded topics. Evaluated 8 models including proprietary and open-weights systems.

Result: Substantial performance gaps were revealed, highlighting limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse and multilingual contexts.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible framework for inclusive multimodal research and demonstrates the need for VLMs that better handle cultural and linguistic diversity.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic medical images, using angle gradient analysis and isolation forests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data helps address data scarcity but may introduce artifacts that compromise model performance and clinical utility, requiring quality assessment methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) feature extractor analyzing per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, (2) isolation forest-based anomaly detector.

Result: Achieved AUC values of 0.97 and 0.91 on two mammography datasets, with human reader agreement rates of 66-68% for most anomalous images, and Kendall-Tau correlations of 0.45 and 0.43.

Conclusion: The method enables responsible use of synthetic data by allowing developers to evaluate synthetic images against anatomical constraints and improve dataset quality.

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [41] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ControlNet++ improves text-to-image generation controllability but has limitations in optimization. The paper proposes Condition Preference Optimization (CPO), which performs preference learning over control signals rather than generated images, achieving better controllability with lower variance and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ optimize only low-noise timesteps and introduce approximation errors, while Direct Preference Optimization faces challenges in isolating controllability from other image quality factors due to generative model uncertainty.

Method: Propose Condition Preference Optimization (CPO) that constructs winning and losing control signals (c^w and c^l) and trains the model to prefer c^w, eliminating confounding factors and providing a low-variance training objective.

Result: CPO significantly improves controllability over ControlNet++: over 10% error rate reduction in segmentation, 70-80% in human pose, and consistent 2-5% reductions in edge and depth maps. It also requires less computation and storage.

Conclusion: CPO provides a more effective approach for improving controllability in text-to-image generation by performing preference optimization directly on control conditions, achieving superior results with lower variance and computational requirements.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN introduces a dynamic adaptive regularization network with task complexity prediction, adaptive dropout modulation, and dynamic capacity gating to address heterogeneity in satellite imagery adaptation of foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adaptation methods for foundation models in geospatial analysis use fixed regularization strategies that fail to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: DARN integrates three innovations: Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) for per-sample difficulty estimation, Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM) that dynamically adjusts dropout rates (0.1-0.5), and Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) for channel activation modulation.

Result: DARN achieves state-of-the-art performance: 86.66% mIoU on GeoBench (+5.56 pp over prior SOTA) in full fine-tuning, and 90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11 with superior OOD generalization (+9.5 pp), enhanced robustness (17% corruption error reduction), and improved minority class performance.

Conclusion: DARN provides a more intelligent, robust, and efficient approach to leveraging foundation models in critical geospatial applications by dynamically adapting to task complexity and heterogeneity.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework using pre-training and fine-tuning to create 3D cloud maps from 2D satellite imagery, specifically applied to tropical cyclones for improved forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tropical cyclone forecasting is challenging due to limited satellite observations of TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in intensification.

Method: Pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties, applied to a custom-built TC dataset.

Result: First global instantaneous 3D cloud maps created, accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of intense storms, extending available satellite observations and providing estimates when observations are missing.

Conclusion: This framework is crucial for advancing understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts by providing comprehensive 3D cloud structure data.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet is a CNN for event-based eye tracking that runs on microcontrollers, with classification and regression versions for pupil detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based eye tracking solutions require powerful GPUs and lack deployment on embedded devices with limited resources.

Method: Developed EETnet CNN using purely event-based data, with training/evaluation/quantization methodology and two architectures: grid-based classification and pixel-level regression.

Result: Created a network capable of running on microcontrollers with limited resources for efficient, low-power eye tracking.

Conclusion: EETnet enables practical deployment of event-based eye tracking on embedded devices, overcoming GPU dependency limitations.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Point Encoder replaces implicit representations like PointNet with explicit geometric representations using learned 3D Gaussians, achieving faster performance with fewer parameters and computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move from implicit representations (like PointNet) to explicit geometric representations for 3D recognition tasks, inspired by similar transitions in 3D reconstruction literature from implicit (NeRF) to explicit (Gaussian Splatting) representations.

Method: Develop optimization techniques using natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to learn Gaussian Basis that reconstructs PointNet activations. Extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting to accelerate performance.

Result: 2.7x faster than comparable PointNet with 46% less memory, 88% fewer FLOPs. In Mamba3D: 1.27x faster with 42% memory reduction and 54% FLOPs reduction. Lightweight enough for high framerates on CPU-only devices.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Point Encoders provide an efficient explicit geometric alternative to implicit representations, offering significant speed, memory, and computational advantages while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [46] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting in biomedical image segmentation using Cellpose, showing that only 10% of data is needed for performance saturation and that selective replay of 5-10% source data prevents forgetting during cross-domain transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two underexplored challenges in generalist biomedical image segmentation models: training data redundancy and the impact of cross-domain transfer on model retention (catastrophic forgetting).

Method: Used dataset quantization (DQ) to construct compact training subsets, performed latent space analysis with MAE embeddings and t-SNE, conducted cross-domain finetuning experiments, and implemented selective DQ-based replay strategies.

Result: Found that segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of data, DQ captures greater feature diversity than random sampling, cross-domain finetuning causes significant source domain degradation, and selective replay of 5-10% source data effectively restores source performance without hindering target adaptation.

Conclusion: Efficient biomedical image segmentation requires data-centric design with compact subsets, retention-aware learning strategies, and informed domain ordering to address both data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available

### [47] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric AI workflow combining active learning and pseudo-labeling to reduce manual annotation requirements for biomedical image segmentation while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional methods (noise sensitivity), nnU-Net (requires substantial annotated data), and foundation models (underperformance on specific datasets) in biomedical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes a pipeline that: 1) generates pseudo-labels from foundation models, 2) uses them for nnU-Net self-configuration, 3) selects representative core-set for minimal manual annotation, and 4) fine-tunes nnU-Net model.

Result: Significantly reduces the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Provides an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in segmentation tasks with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new geometry denoising method using surface normal priors and segmentation via label vectors with total variation regularization, solved using split Bregman (ADMM) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a geometry denoising approach that incorporates prior knowledge about surface normal vectors to improve denoising quality through segmentation.

Method: Uses preferred normal vectors (label vectors) for segmentation during denoising, with total variation regularization. Solved via split Bregman (ADMM) approach with vertex updates based on second-order shape calculus.

Result: The method enables simultaneous denoising and segmentation of geometry based on normal vector similarity to predefined label vectors.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm effectively integrates normal vector priors and segmentation into geometry denoising, providing a comprehensive solution through the split Bregman optimization framework.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

*Kyle Fogarty,Chenyue Cai,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Cengiz Öztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An implicit self-prior approach that learns shape-specific priors directly from input point clouds using cross-attention to a learnable dictionary, enabling high-quality surface reconstruction without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point clouds is ill-posed without strong geometric priors, and existing methods often require external training data or fail to preserve fine details.

Method: Jointly trains a dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field using cross-attention, then samples the trained field to extract dense points and normals for integration with robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS).

Result: Outperforms both classical and learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy effectively preserves fine geometric details while leveraging learned priors to regularize sparse regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised learning for surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clinical-ComBAT is a flexible diffusion MRI harmonization method for clinical use that handles non-linear relationships, small cohorts, and dynamically changing sites without requiring population homogeneity or fixed site numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current harmonization methods like ComBAT have limitations for clinical use due to their reliance on linear covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well-populated sites, which don't align with real-world clinical scenarios.

Method: Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently using a non-linear polynomial data model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, variance priors adaptable to small cohorts, hyperparameter tuning, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

Result: The method shows improved alignment of diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling on both simulated and real data.

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT provides an effective solution for diffusion MRI harmonization in clinical settings, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling flexible integration of data from multiple acquisition sites.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (Swin v1/v2) initially showed superior accuracy (100%/99.1%) for ear disease diagnosis compared to ResNet (99.5%), but data leakage in preprocessing inflated results. After correction, all models performed similarly (~82-83%), highlighting the critical importance of proper data handling in medical ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy for ear diseases given the reported 27% misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, and evaluate whether vision transformers outperform traditional CNNs in this medical imaging task.

Method: Used Swin v1 and Swin v2 transformer models on otoscopic video frames from a real-world hospital dataset. Frames were selected using Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Compared performance against ResNet CNN.

Result: Initial results showed excellent performance (Swin v1: 100%, Swin v2: 99.1%, ResNet: 99.5%) but data leakage was discovered. After correction, all models performed similarly: Swin v1/v2: 83%, ResNet: 82%.

Conclusion: Vision transformers show promise but rigorous data preprocessing is equally important as model architecture. The balance between advanced architectures and proper data handling is crucial for developing reliable medical diagnostic models.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

TL;DR: Novel geospatial deep learning framework using satellite imagery to predict fatal crash risks with uncertainty-aware Beta probability distributions, outperforming baselines by 17-23% in recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional traffic safety studies that examine risk factors in isolation and conventional Neural Networks that provide point estimates without uncertainty, which is critical for safety-critical decision-making.

Method: Leverage satellite imagery as comprehensive spatial input to capture nuanced spatial patterns and embedded environmental risk factors, estimating full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk instead of deterministic outputs.

Result: Model achieves 17-23% improvement in recall compared to baselines, with superior calibration, enabling accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for flagging potential dangers.

Conclusion: Provides reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, enabling safer autonomous navigation and offering scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IMDNet, an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that uses decoupled degradation representations to dynamically select optimal restoration paths for handling multiple coexisting degradations like rain, noise, and haze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing image restoration methods focus on single degradation types, but real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: Uses degradation ingredient decoupling blocks (DIDBlock) to separate degradation ingredients statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information. Employs fusion blocks (FBlock) for cross-level degradation integration and task adaptation blocks (TABlock) to dynamically activate/fuse functional branches based on multi-degradation representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: IMDNet provides an effective tightly integrated architecture for handling multiple coexisting degradations in real-world image restoration scenarios.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework using high-dimensional latent space representations and Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) for robust and adaptive deepfake watermarking that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing deepfake detectors that struggle with generalization and the challenge of balancing robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering in proactive watermarking approaches.

Method: Developed a learnable watermark embedder operating in latent space to capture high-level image semantics, combined with MAARL paradigm where watermarking agent interacts with adversarial attacker agent simulating benign and malicious manipulations.

Result: Achieved improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ benchmarks under challenging manipulation scenarios, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the robustness-fragility tradeoff in deepfake watermarking through latent space representations and adversarial reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior performance in detecting synthetic media.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLM enables 3D Gaussian Splatting to render large scenes on consumer GPUs by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory and using pipelining to overlap communication and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting has high memory requirements that exceed GPU capacity for large scenes, limiting its practical use on consumer hardware.

Method: Offload Gaussians to CPU memory and load them to GPU only when needed; use pipelining to overlap GPU-CPU communication with computation; reduce communication volume by exploiting memory access patterns.

Result: Can render scenes with 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: CLM successfully enables large-scale 3DGS rendering on consumer GPUs through efficient memory management and pipelining techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

*Xiongri Shen,Jiaqi Wang,Yi Zhong,Zhenxi Song,Leilei Zhao,Yichen Wei,Lingyan Liang,Shuqiang Wang,Baiying Lei,Demao Deng,Zhiguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDS is a novel method for synthesizing missing fMRI and dMRI modalities using a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework with tissue refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing MRI modalities (fMRI and dMRI) pose a major clinical barrier for neurodegenerative disease studies, and existing GAN/diffusion approaches struggle with significant signal differences between fMRI and dMRI and inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns.

Method: Proposes PDS with two innovations: (1) pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) tissue refinement network with efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details.

Result: Achieves PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2%). Clinical validation shows 67.92%/66.02%/64.15% accuracy for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification in hybrid real-synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: PDS effectively addresses the challenges in fMRI-dMRI synthesis and demonstrates strong diagnostic performance for neurodegenerative diseases, providing a valuable tool for clinical applications where modalities are missing.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

*Jian Wang,Yixing Yong,Haixia Bi,Lijun He,Fan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using optimized shapes as semantic carriers, interpretability tools, and adversarial examples for deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the geometric understanding of DNNs, which has been understudied compared to texture-based recognition.

Method: An end-to-end differentiable framework combining Fourier series for shape parameterization, winding number-based pixel mapping, and signal energy constraints for optimization efficiency.

Result: Shapes can generate high-confidence classifications, precisely isolate model's salient regions, and deceive downstream visual tasks as adversarial examples.

Conclusion: Provides a versatile framework for understanding DNNs' geometric perception and opens new frontiers for machine perception analysis.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

*Dylan Peek,Matthew P. Skerritt,Siddharth Pritam,Stephan Chalup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to generate labeled 3D datasets for topological data analysis using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, trains a genus estimator network, and shows that geometric complexity affects accuracy alongside topological complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDA methods like persistent homology are computationally demanding, and there's a lack of labeled 3D data specifically designed for supervised learning in TDA tasks.

Method: Systematically generate labeled 3D datasets using the Repulsive Surface algorithm to control topological invariants like hole count, then train a genus estimator network using a 3D convolutional transformer architecture.

Result: The trained network shows decreased accuracy as deformations increase, highlighting that both topological complexity and geometric complexity affect the performance of generalized estimators.

Conclusion: The generated dataset addresses the gap in labeled 3D datasets for TDA, enabling better training and evaluation of neural network-based estimators while demonstrating the importance of geometric complexity in addition to topological complexity.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Conclusion: By releasing Triple-S benchmark and GSE model, the authors provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings to enable future research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content generation.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a language bias in LVLM architectures and proposes refining text embeddings with average-pooled visual features to improve visual grounding and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent bias in current LVLM architectures toward language modality caused by simply appending visual embeddings to text sequences.

Method: Propose refining textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features as a simple yet effective approach.

Result: The method demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: While average pooling works effectively, more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and cross-modal alignment, but are left for future work.

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

*Jing Jin,Xu Liu,Te Gao,Zhihong Shi,Yixiong Liang,Ruiqing Zheng,Hulin Kuang,Min Zeng,Shichao Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed DRE-SLCL method for end-to-end WSI representation using dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning to handle gigapixel slides with thousands of tiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training end-to-end WSI representation models is challenging due to GPU limitations when processing tens of thousands of image tiles from gigapixel slides in a single mini-batch.

Method: Uses memory bank to store tile features across dataset, samples tiles from mini-batch, retrieves additional features from memory bank, and applies residual encoding to generate WSI representations with slide-level contrastive learning using histopathology reports.

Result: Experiments on cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL provides an effective solution for end-to-end WSI representation learning by overcoming GPU memory limitations through dynamic residual encoding and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

TL;DR: Pressure2Motion generates human motion from ground pressure sequences and text prompts using a dual-level feature extractor and hierarchical diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art performance without cameras or wearables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture by eliminating the need for specialized lighting, cameras, or wearable devices, addressing the ill-posed nature of pressure-to-motion conversion.

Method: Uses a generative model with dual-level feature extractor for pressure data interpretation and hierarchical diffusion model that discerns movement trajectories and posture adjustments, leveraging both physical pressure cues and semantic text guidance.

Result: Generates high-fidelity, physically plausible motions and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance, with the MPL benchmark being the first for this task.

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion is a pioneering work that successfully combines pressure data and linguistic priors for motion generation, offering a practical solution for privacy-preserving and cost-effective motion capture scenarios.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: NTP-MRISeg reformulates medical referring image segmentation as an autoregressive next-token prediction task using unified multimodal sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance with simplified architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRIS approaches involve complex multimodal fusion designs and multi-stage decoders, which the authors aim to simplify while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes NTP-MRISeg framework with three key strategies: Next-k Token Prediction to reduce cumulative errors, Token-level Contrastive Learning for boundary sensitivity, and memory-based Hard Error Token optimization for difficult tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming traditional MRIS pipelines.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg provides a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional MRIS approaches by eliminating modality-specific fusion and external segmentation models while achieving superior results.

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PITTA is a novel test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that achieves state-of-the-art performance through pose-agnostic adaptation and instance-aware masking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods for monocular depth estimation are ineffective in diverse and dynamic real-world environments, requiring a more robust solution that can adapt without camera pose information.

Method: Proposes PITTA with two key strategies: (1) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm that adapts pretrained MDE networks without camera pose information, and (2) instance-aware image masking that extracts dynamic object masks using pretrained panoptic segmentation and removes static background components.

Result: Extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets show PITTA surpasses state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance improvements in monocular depth estimation during test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: PITTA provides an effective and practical solution for test-time adaptation in monocular depth estimation, demonstrating superior performance across varying environmental conditions without requiring camera pose information.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP improves CLIP training by using multi-perspective role-playing prompts to generate more semantically diverse captions from MLLMs, achieving better performance with fewer training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods focus on increasing data volume but result in limited semantic diversity and redundant captions, which limits CLIP model effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Role-SynthCLIP framework that uses multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., compositional analyst, interpreter of image context) to guide MLLMs in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints.

Result: CLIP-B/16 trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves 64.1% Recall@1 on MS COCO, surpassing the best existing synthetic baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment of synthetic pairs, improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while maintaining the same number of image-text pairs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical smoke during laparoscopic procedures degrades visual quality, increasing surgical error risks and hindering clinical decision-making and computer-assisted analysis, making smoke removal critical for patient safety and operative efficiency.

Method: SurgiATM statistically combines physics-based atmospheric models with data-driven deep learning, designed as a lightweight plug-and-play module with only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving original network architectures.

Result: Experiments on three surgical datasets with ten desmoking methods show SurgiATM reduces restoration errors and enhances generalizability across diverse procedures including cholecystectomy, nephrectomy, and diaphragm dissection.

Conclusion: SurgiATM provides a convenient, low-cost, effective, and generalizable solution for surgical smoke removal that can be seamlessly integrated into existing desmoking architectures without computational overhead.

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial attacks.

Method: Introduced Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under occlusion. Used controlled experiments on CIFAR-10 with nine canonical attacks. Proposed Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example Detection (SWM-AED).

Result: Adversarial examples have significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals. SWM-AED demonstrated robust performance with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to 96.5% across classifiers and attacks.

Conclusion: The occlusion sensitivity property can be effectively leveraged for adversarial example detection, avoiding catastrophic overfitting of conventional adversarial training.

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

TL;DR: DPPP is a dual-stage framework that generates privacy-preserving virtual data for person re-identification using diffusion models and learns domain-invariant features through prompt-driven disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in person Re-ID by creating virtual datasets that overcome limitations of existing game-engine datasets like complex construction and poor domain generalization.

Method: Stage 1: Generate diverse virtual data (GenePerson dataset) using multi-dimensional prompts. Stage 2: Use Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) with contrastive learning to separate style and content features for domain-invariant learning.

Result: Models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance, outperforming models trained on both real and existing virtual Re-ID datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DPPP paradigm effectively addresses privacy concerns while achieving superior domain generalization in person re-identification through virtual data generation and feature disentanglement.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

*Fuyang Liu,Jiaqi Xu,Xiaowei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-level reinforcement learning framework for adverse weather visual perception that uses a physics-driven dataset for cold-start training, with local weather-specific restoration models and a global meta-controller for dynamic model orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, and existing vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to generalize to complex weather degradations.

Method: Construct HFLS-Weather dataset (physics-driven, high-fidelity simulation of diverse weather phenomena), then design dual-level reinforcement learning framework: local level refines weather-specific restoration models through perturbation-driven image quality optimization with reward-based learning; global level uses meta-controller to dynamically orchestrate model selection and execution order based on scene degradation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of adverse weather scenarios and enables continuous adaptation to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses adverse weather visual perception challenges through physics-driven simulation and adaptive reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

### [71] [Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Retinal OCT Images: A UK Biobank Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05106)
*Yasemin Turkan,F. Boray Tek,M. Serdar Nazlı,Öykü Eren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First deep learning study using raw OCT B-scans for Alzheimer's disease prediction, achieving AUC of 0.62 in 4-year cohort with ResNet-34, highlighting challenges in early detection years before clinical diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore direct classification of OCT B-scan images for early Alzheimer's disease detection, moving beyond traditional segmented layer thickness measurements, as this represents the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans for AD prediction.

Method: Fine-tuned multiple pretrained models (ImageNet-based networks and OCT-specific RETFound transformer) using UK Biobank data with subject-level cross-validation, applied standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques, and used year-weighted loss function prioritizing cases diagnosed within four years of imaging.

Result: ResNet-34 achieved the most stable results with AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort, below clinical application threshold but explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in central macular subfield between AD and control groups.

Conclusion: Study provides baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, demonstrates challenges in detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before diagnosis, and highlights need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches for improved early detection.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

### [72] [SnowyLane: Robust Lane Detection on Snow-covered Rural Roads Using Infrastructural Elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05108)
*Jörg Gamerdinger,Benedict Wetzel,Patrick Schulz,Sven Teufel,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel lane detection method for snow-covered roads that detects roadside delineators instead of lane markings, using Bezier curves to fit lane trajectories, with a new synthetic dataset called SnowyLane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection in snow-covered environments is challenging due to frequent absence or occlusion of traditional lane markings, requiring alternative approaches for autonomous driving in winter conditions.

Method: Detects vertical roadside posts (delineators) as indirect lane indicators, then fits smooth lane trajectories using parameterized Bezier curve models while leveraging spatial consistency and road geometry. Uses a synthetic dataset of 80,000 annotated frames with varying snow coverage and lighting.

Result: Significantly improved robustness in adverse weather compared to state-of-the-art lane detection systems, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for all-weather autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at
