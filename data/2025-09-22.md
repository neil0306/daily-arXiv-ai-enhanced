### [1] [Synthetic bootstrapped pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15248)
*Zitong Yang,Aonan Zhang,Hong Liu,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Emmanuel Cand√®s,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP) is a new LM pretraining method that learns inter-document relations to synthesize additional training data, improving performance without requiring massive unique datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pretraining only models token correlations within single documents, missing rich inter-document correlations that could enhance LM performance. SBP aims to efficiently capture these learnable relationships.

Method: SBP first learns a model of relations between documents from the pretraining dataset, then uses it to synthesize a vast new corpus for joint training. It abstracts core concepts from seed material and creates new narrations.

Result: A 3B-parameter model trained on up to 1T tokens showed SBP consistently improves upon repetition baselines and achieves significant performance gains comparable to using 20x more unique data. Synthesized documents go beyond paraphrases to create novel content.

Conclusion: SBP effectively captures latent concepts shared between related documents, admits a natural Bayesian interpretation, and provides strong empirical performance improvements while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP), a language model (LM)
pretraining procedure that first learns a model of relations between documents
from the pretraining dataset and then leverages it to synthesize a vast new
corpus for joint training. While the standard pretraining teaches LMs to learn
causal correlations among tokens within a single document, it is not designed
to efficiently model the rich, learnable inter-document correlations that can
potentially lead to better performance. We validate SBP by designing a
compute-matched pretraining setup and pretrain a 3B-parameter model on up to 1T
tokens from scratch. We find SBP consistently improves upon a strong repetition
baseline and delivers a significant fraction of performance improvement
attainable by an oracle upper bound with access to 20x more unique data.
Qualitative analysis reveals that the synthesized documents go beyond mere
paraphrases -- SBP first abstracts a core concept from the seed material and
then crafts a new narration on top of it. Besides strong empirical performance,
SBP admits a natural Bayesian interpretation: the synthesizer implicitly learns
to abstract the latent concepts shared between related documents.

### [2] [Comparative Analysis of Tokenization Algorithms for Low-Resource Language Dzongkha](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15255)
*Tandin Wangchuk,Tad Gonsalves*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three tokenization algorithms (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece) for Dzongkha, a low-resource language, finding SentencePiece most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenizers are crucial for LLMs but perform poorly for low-resource languages like Dzongkha, which has unique linguistic challenges and lacks research in NLP.

Method: Evaluated three tokenization algorithms (Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece, SentencePiece) using metrics like Subword Fertility, Proportion of Continued Words, Normalized Sequence Length, and execution time.

Result: All three algorithms showed potential, but SentencePiece was identified as the most effective for Dzongkha tokenization.

Conclusion: SentencePiece is the best choice for Dzongkha tokenization, highlighting the need for tailored approaches for low-resource languages and enabling future Dzongkha LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity and improving rapidly.
Tokenizers are crucial components of natural language processing, especially
for LLMs. Tokenizers break down input text into tokens that models can easily
process while ensuring the text is accurately represented, capturing its
meaning and structure. Effective tokenizers enhance the capabilities of LLMs by
improving a model's understanding of context and semantics, ultimately leading
to better performance in various downstream tasks, such as translation,
classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation. Most pre-trained
tokenizers are suitable for high-resource languages like English but perform
poorly for low-resource languages. Dzongkha, Bhutan's national language spoken
by around seven hundred thousand people, is a low-resource language, and its
linguistic complexity poses unique NLP challenges. Despite some progress,
significant research in Dzongkha NLP is lacking, particularly in tokenization.
This study evaluates the training and performance of three common tokenization
algorithms in comparison to other popular methods. Specifically, Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece (Unigram) were evaluated for their
suitability for Dzongkha. Performance was assessed using metrics like Subword
Fertility, Proportion of Continued Words, Normalized Sequence Length, and
execution time. The results show that while all three algorithms demonstrate
potential, SentencePiece is the most effective for Dzongkha tokenization,
paving the way for further NLP advancements. This underscores the need for
tailored approaches for low-resource languages and ongoing research. In this
study, we presented three tokenization algorithms for Dzongkha, paving the way
for building Dzongkha Large Language Models.

### [3] [Toxicity Red-Teaming: Benchmarking LLM Safety in Singapore's Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15260)
*Yujia Hu,Ming Shan Hee,Preslav Nakov,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGToxicGuard introduces a dataset and evaluation framework to benchmark LLM safety in Singapore's multilingual context, revealing critical safety gaps through red-teaming experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM safety mechanisms are under-explored in low-resource multilingual settings, particularly in culturally diverse environments like Singapore with languages including Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil.

Method: Adopts a red-teaming approach to systematically probe LLM vulnerabilities across three real-world scenarios: conversation, question-answering, and content composition. Uses the SGToxicGuard dataset for extensive experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.

Result: Experiments uncover critical gaps in LLM safety guardrails, demonstrating vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms when tested in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Conclusion: The research provides actionable insights for cultural sensitivity and toxicity mitigation, laying the foundation for safer and more inclusive AI systems in linguistically diverse environments.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed natural
language processing; however, their safety mechanisms remain under-explored in
low-resource, multilingual settings. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In
particular, we introduce \textsf{SGToxicGuard}, a novel dataset and evaluation
framework for benchmarking LLM safety in Singapore's diverse linguistic
context, including Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. SGToxicGuard adopts a
red-teaming approach to systematically probe LLM vulnerabilities in three
real-world scenarios: \textit{conversation}, \textit{question-answering}, and
\textit{content composition}. We conduct extensive experiments with
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs, and the results uncover critical gaps in
their safety guardrails. By offering actionable insights into cultural
sensitivity and toxicity mitigation, we lay the foundation for safer and more
inclusive AI systems in linguistically diverse environments.\footnote{Link to

### [4] [PolBiX: Detecting LLMs' Political Bias in Fact-Checking through X-phemisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15335)
*Charlott Jakob,David Harbecke,Patrick Parschan,Pia Wenzel Neves,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates political bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) by testing their consistency in classifying factually equivalent German claims that differ only in political connotation through euphemisms or dysphemisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for objective assessment tasks, but concerns exist about political bias potentially compromising their objectivity. While previous studies found left-leaning preferences in LLMs, the downstream effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored.

Method: Researchers constructed minimal pairs of factually equivalent German claims that differ only in political connotation (using euphemisms vs dysphemisms) and evaluated six LLMs' consistency in truthfulness classification. They also tested whether explicit calls for objectivism in prompts could mitigate bias.

Result: The presence of judgmental words significantly influences truthfulness assessment more than political leaning. While some models showed political bias tendencies, this bias was not mitigated by explicitly calling for objectivism in prompts.

Conclusion: Political bias in LLMs' fact-checking is more influenced by judgmental language than political leaning, and simple prompt engineering (calling for objectivism) does not effectively mitigate existing biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in applications requiring
objective assessment, which could be compromised by political bias. Many
studies found preferences for left-leaning positions in LLMs, but downstream
effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored. In this study, we
systematically investigate political bias through exchanging words with
euphemisms or dysphemisms in German claims. We construct minimal pairs of
factually equivalent claims that differ in political connotation, to assess the
consistency of LLMs in classifying them as true or false. We evaluate six LLMs
and find that, more than political leaning, the presence of judgmental words
significantly influences truthfulness assessment. While a few models show
tendencies of political bias, this is not mitigated by explicitly calling for
objectivism in prompts.

### [5] [Quantifying Self-Awareness of Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15339)
*Yeongbin Seo,Dongha Lee,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the interpretation of hallucination prediction in LLMs as self-awareness, arguing it often stems from question-side shortcuts. It introduces AQE to quantify question-awareness effects and SCAO method to enhance genuine model-side introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle whether hallucination prediction performance in LLMs comes from true self-awareness or simply exploiting superficial patterns in questions.

Method: Proposed Approximate Question-side Effect (AQE) to quantify question-awareness contribution, and Semantic Compression by Answering in One word (SCAO) to enhance model-side signals.

Result: Analysis revealed much reported success stems from question-side shortcuts. SCAO achieved strong, consistent performance especially when question-side cues were reduced.

Conclusion: SCAO effectively fosters genuine self-awareness in LLMs by reducing reliance on question-side patterns and enhancing model-side introspection.

Abstract: Hallucination prediction in large language models (LLMs) is often interpreted
as a sign of self-awareness. However, we argue that such performance can arise
from question-side shortcuts rather than true model-side introspection. To
disentangle these factors, we propose the Approximate Question-side Effect
(AQE), which quantifies the contribution of question-awareness. Our analysis
across multiple datasets reveals that much of the reported success stems from
exploiting superficial patterns in questions. We further introduce SCAO
(Semantic Compression by Answering in One word), a method that enhances the use
of model-side signals. Experiments show that SCAO achieves strong and
consistent performance, particularly in settings with reduced question-side
cues, highlighting its effectiveness in fostering genuine self-awareness in
LLMs.

### [6] [Real, Fake, or Manipulated? Detecting Machine-Influenced Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15350)
*Yitong Wang,Zhongping Zhang,Margherita Piana,Zheng Zhou,Peter Gerstoft,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HERO is a hierarchical detector that classifies text into four types (human-written, machine-generated, machine-polished, machine-translated) using length-specialist models with subcategory guidance to distinguish fine-grained uses of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-generated text detection focuses only on human vs machine distinction, ignoring important fine-grained uses like translation or polishing which have different implications for intent and potential misuse.

Method: HERO combines predictions from length-specialist models trained with Subcategory Guidance that encourages separation of easily confused categories (e.g., different source languages) to improve fine-grained classification.

Result: Extensive experiments across five LLMs and six domains show HERO outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.5-3 mAP on average.

Conclusion: HERO provides a robust framework for detecting fine-grained machine-influenced text, addressing the limitations of binary classification approaches and enabling better understanding of LLM usage intent.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLMs) can be used to write or modify documents,
presenting a challenge for understanding the intent behind their use. For
example, benign uses may involve using LLM on a human-written document to
improve its grammar or to translate it into another language. However, a
document entirely produced by a LLM may be more likely to be used to spread
misinformation than simple translation (\eg, from use by malicious actors or
simply by hallucinating). Prior works in Machine Generated Text (MGT) detection
mostly focus on simply identifying whether a document was human or machine
written, ignoring these fine-grained uses. In this paper, we introduce a
HiErarchical, length-RObust machine-influenced text detector (HERO), which
learns to separate text samples of varying lengths from four primary types:
human-written, machine-generated, machine-polished, and machine-translated.
HERO accomplishes this by combining predictions from length-specialist models
that have been trained with Subcategory Guidance. Specifically, for categories
that are easily confused (\eg, different source languages), our Subcategory
Guidance module encourages separation of the fine-grained categories, boosting
performance. Extensive experiments across five LLMs and six domains demonstrate
the benefits of our HERO, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 2.5-3 mAP on
average.

### [7] [Beyond Spurious Signals: Debiasing Multimodal Large Language Models via Counterfactual Inference and Adaptive Expert Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15361)
*Zichen Wu,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A causal mediation-based debiasing framework for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that addresses spurious correlation bias using counterfactual examples and Mixture-of-Experts architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs frequently rely on spurious correlations between visual and textual information, which undermines their robustness and generalization in complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Method: Distinguishes core semantics from spurious contexts via counterfactual examples for training-stage debiasing, and employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with dynamic routing to selectively engage modality-specific debiasing experts.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multimodal sarcasm detection and sentiment analysis tasks demonstrates significant improvement over unimodal debiasing strategies and existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed causal mediation-based debiasing framework effectively enhances MLLM robustness by addressing superficial correlation bias through counterfactual analysis and expert-based modality-specific debiasing.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown substantial capabilities
in integrating visual and textual information, yet frequently rely on spurious
correlations, undermining their robustness and generalization in complex
multimodal reasoning tasks. This paper addresses the critical challenge of
superficial correlation bias in MLLMs through a novel causal mediation-based
debiasing framework. Specially, we distinguishing core semantics from spurious
textual and visual contexts via counterfactual examples to activate
training-stage debiasing and employ a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with dynamic routing to selectively engages modality-specific debiasing
experts. Empirical evaluation on multimodal sarcasm detection and sentiment
analysis tasks demonstrates that our framework significantly surpasses unimodal
debiasing strategies and existing state-of-the-art models.

### [8] [Speech Language Models for Under-Represented Languages: Insights from Wolof](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15362)
*Yaya Sy,Dioula Doucour√©,Christophe Cerisara,Irina Illina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training the first Speech LLM for Wolof language using large-scale spontaneous speech data, achieving improved ASR performance and extending to speech translation with Chain-of-Thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of speech language models for underrepresented languages like Wolof spoken in West Africa, and extend capabilities beyond speech recognition to tasks like speech translation.

Method: 1) Collect large-scale spontaneous high-quality Wolof speech data 2) Continue pretraining HuBERT on this dataset 3) Integrate speech encoder into Wolof LLM 4) Explore multi-step Chain-of-Thought reasoning before transcription/translation

Result: The Speech LLM outperforms base models and African-centric models on ASR, performs well in speech translation, and shows improved speech recognition capabilities.

Conclusion: Successfully created the first Speech LLM for Wolof that enhances both speech recognition and translation, with models and code to be openly shared to benefit underrepresented language communities.

Abstract: We present our journey in training a speech language model for Wolof, an
underrepresented language spoken in West Africa, and share key insights. We
first emphasize the importance of collecting large-scale, spontaneous,
high-quality speech data, and show that continued pretraining HuBERT on this
dataset outperforms both the base model and African-centric models on ASR. We
then integrate this speech encoder into a Wolof LLM to train the first Speech
LLM for this language, extending its capabilities to tasks such as speech
translation. Furthermore, we explore training the Speech LLM to perform
multi-step Chain-of-Thought before transcribing or translating. Our results
show that the Speech LLM not only improves speech recognition but also performs
well in speech translation. The models and the code will be openly shared.

### [9] [Frustratingly Easy Data Augmentation for Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15373)
*Katsumi Ibaraki,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Three text-based data augmentation methods for low-resource ASR that generate synthetic audio via TTS, achieving significant WER reductions across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited training data in low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition by creating effective data augmentation techniques that don't require additional annotated data.

Method: Three self-contained methods: gloss-based replacement, random replacement, and LLM-based text generation, followed by Text-to-Speech conversion to create synthetic audio. Applied to pretrained Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 model fine-tuning.

Result: Significant performance gains including 14.3% absolute WER reduction for Nashta. Effective across all four low-resource languages (Vatlongos, Nashta, Shinekhen Buryat, Kakabe) and also beneficial for high-resource languages like English.

Conclusion: The proposed text-based data augmentation methods are broadly applicable and effective for improving ASR performance in both low-resource and high-resource language scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces three self-contained data augmentation methods for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Our techniques first generate
novel text--using gloss-based replacement, random replacement, or an LLM-based
approach--and then apply Text-to-Speech (TTS) to produce synthetic audio. We
apply these methods, which leverage only the original annotated data, to four
languages with extremely limited resources (Vatlongos, Nashta, Shinekhen
Buryat, and Kakabe). Fine-tuning a pretrained Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 model on a
combination of the original audio and generated synthetic data yields
significant performance gains, including a 14.3% absolute WER reduction for
Nashta. The methods prove effective across all four low-resource languages and
also show utility for high-resource languages like English, demonstrating their
broad applicability.

### [10] [Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Explanations of Large Language Models for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15403)
*Yangyi Li,Mengdi Huai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel uncertainty estimation framework for natural language explanations generated by LLMs, addressing the lack of valid uncertainty guarantees in existing explanation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current natural language explanations for LLMs lack valid uncertainty quantification, which is critical for understanding confidence in explanations, especially given the auto-regressive generation process and noise in domains like medical inquiries.

Method: The authors propose a post-hoc, model-agnostic uncertainty estimation framework for natural language explanations, along with a robust uncertainty estimation method that maintains valid guarantees under noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on QA tasks demonstrate the desired performance of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap in uncertainty quantification for natural language explanations, providing valid uncertainty guarantees that are robust to noise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities, enabling
concise, context-aware answers in question answering (QA) tasks. The lack of
transparency in complex LLMs has inspired extensive research aimed at
developing methods to explain large language behaviors. Among existing
explanation methods, natural language explanations stand out due to their
ability to explain LLMs in a self-explanatory manner and enable the
understanding of model behaviors even when the models are closed-source.
However, despite these promising advancements, there is no existing work
studying how to provide valid uncertainty guarantees for these generated
natural language explanations. Such uncertainty quantification is critical in
understanding the confidence behind these explanations. Notably, generating
valid uncertainty estimates for natural language explanations is particularly
challenging due to the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs and the
presence of noise in medical inquiries. To bridge this gap, in this work, we
first propose a novel uncertainty estimation framework for these generated
natural language explanations, which provides valid uncertainty guarantees in a
post-hoc and model-agnostic manner. Additionally, we also design a novel robust
uncertainty estimation method that maintains valid uncertainty guarantees even
under noise. Extensive experiments on QA tasks demonstrate the desired
performance of our methods.

### [11] [Deep learning and abstractive summarisation for radiological reports: an empirical study for adapting the PEGASUS models' family with scarce data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15419)
*Claudio Benzoni,Martina Langhals,Martin Boeker,Luise Modersohn,M√°t√© E. Maros*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates fine-tuning PEGASUS and PEGASUS-X models for medical text summarization, analyzing overfitting/underfitting risks with limited training data and identifying performance patterns like double-descent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abstractive summarization remains challenging in sensitive medical domains with data restrictions, and automated tools are increasingly needed for complex medical text summarization as imaging data grows.

Method: Fine-tuned PEGASUS and PEGASUS-X encoder-decoder models on a medium-sized radiological reports dataset, evaluating different checkpoints with varying training data sizes using lexical and semantic metrics on validation sets.

Result: PEGASUS showed phases related to epoch-wise double-descent or peak-drop-recovery behavior, while PEGASUS-X with larger checkpoints suffered performance detriment. Both models demonstrated challenges with high expressivity on scarce training data.

Conclusion: The work highlights risks of fine-tuning expressive models with limited data and provides groundwork for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies for specialized domain summarization models.

Abstract: Regardless of the rapid development of artificial intelligence, abstractive
summarisation is still challenging for sensitive and data-restrictive domains
like medicine. With the increasing number of imaging, the relevance of
automated tools for complex medical text summarisation is expected to become
highly relevant. In this paper, we investigated the adaptation via fine-tuning
process of a non-domain-specific abstractive summarisation encoder-decoder
model family, and gave insights to practitioners on how to avoid over- and
underfitting. We used PEGASUS and PEGASUS-X, on a medium-sized radiological
reports public dataset. For each model, we comprehensively evaluated two
different checkpoints with varying sizes of the same training data. We
monitored the models' performances with lexical and semantic metrics during the
training history on the fixed-size validation set. PEGASUS exhibited different
phases, which can be related to epoch-wise double-descent, or
peak-drop-recovery behaviour. For PEGASUS-X, we found that using a larger
checkpoint led to a performance detriment. This work highlights the challenges
and risks of fine-tuning models with high expressivity when dealing with scarce
training data, and lays the groundwork for future investigations into more
robust fine-tuning strategies for summarisation models in specialised domains.

### [12] [BiRQ: Bi-Level Self-Labeling Random Quantization for Self-Supervised Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15430)
*Liuyuan Jiang,Xiaodong Cui,Brian Kingsbury,Tianyi Chen,Lisha Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiRQ is a bilevel self-supervised learning framework that combines the efficiency of BEST-RQ with HuBERT-style label refinement by using the model itself as a pseudo-label generator, eliminating external encoders and enabling end-to-end training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech SSL requires informative yet efficient pseudo-labels. Current methods face trade-offs: HuBERT provides strong labels but requires complex multi-stage pipelines, while BEST-RQ is simple but produces weaker labels.

Method: BiRQ uses intermediate model representations discretized by a random-projection quantizer to generate enhanced labels, with anchoring labels from raw input for stability. It employs first-order bilevel optimization with differentiable Gumbel-softmax selection for end-to-end training.

Result: BiRQ consistently outperforms BEST-RQ while maintaining low complexity and computational efficiency across various datasets including 960-hour LibriSpeech, 150-hour AMI meetings, and 5,000-hour YODAS.

Conclusion: The proposed bilevel SSL framework successfully combines efficiency with label refinement, eliminating external encoders and enabling iterative label enhancement in an end-to-end fashion.

Abstract: Speech is a rich signal, and labeled audio-text pairs are costly, making
self-supervised learning essential for scalable representation learning. A core
challenge in speech SSL is generating pseudo-labels that are both informative
and efficient: strong labels, such as those used in HuBERT, improve downstream
performance but rely on external encoders and multi-stage pipelines, while
efficient methods like BEST-RQ achieve simplicity at the cost of weaker labels.
We propose BiRQ, a bilevel SSL framework that combines the efficiency of
BEST-RQ with the refinement benefits of HuBERT-style label enhancement. The key
idea is to reuse part of the model itself as a pseudo-label generator:
intermediate representations are discretized by a random-projection quantizer
to produce enhanced labels, while anchoring labels derived directly from the
raw input stabilize training and prevent collapse. Training is formulated as an
efficient first-order bilevel optimization problem, solved end-to-end with
differentiable Gumbel-softmax selection. This design eliminates the need for
external label encoders, reduces memory cost, and enables iterative label
refinement in an end-to-end fashion. BiRQ consistently improves over BEST-RQ
while maintaining low complexity and computational efficiency. We validate our
method on various datasets, including 960-hour LibriSpeech, 150-hour AMI
meetings and 5,000-hour YODAS, demonstrating consistent gains over BEST-RQ.

### [13] [PILOT: Steering Synthetic Data Generation with Psychological & Linguistic Output Targeting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15447)
*Caitlin Cisar,Emily Sheffield,Joshua Drake,Alden Harrell,Subramanian Chidambaram,Nikita Nangia,Vinayak Arannil,Alex Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PILOT introduces a two-phase framework for steering LLMs using structured psycholinguistic profiles instead of natural language personas, improving output coherence and reducing artificial repetition while maintaining response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language persona representations force models to make unintended inferences about attribute emphasis, limiting precise control over synthetic data generation outputs.

Method: Two-phase framework: Phase 1 translates natural language personas into structured psycholinguistic profiles with normalized scores; Phase 2 uses these profiles to guide generation along measurable axes. Evaluated across 3 LLMs using 25 personas under three steering conditions (NPS, SBS, HPS).

Result: Schema-based approaches significantly reduce artificial persona repetition and improve coherence (silhouette scores: 0.098‚Üí0.237, topic purity: 0.773‚Üí0.957). SBS produces concise, topically consistent outputs; NPS offers lexical diversity but less predictability; HPS balances both.

Conclusion: PILOT effectively addresses limitations of natural language persona steering, with schema-based methods providing better control and consistency while maintaining output quality across different LLMs.

Abstract: Generative AI applications commonly leverage user personas as a steering
mechanism for synthetic data generation, but reliance on natural language
representations forces models to make unintended inferences about which
attributes to emphasize, limiting precise control over outputs. We introduce
PILOT (Psychological and Linguistic Output Targeting), a two-phase framework
for steering large language models with structured psycholinguistic profiles.
In Phase 1, PILOT translates natural language persona descriptions into
multidimensional profiles with normalized scores across linguistic and
psychological dimensions. In Phase 2, these profiles guide generation along
measurable axes of variation. We evaluate PILOT across three state-of-the-art
LLMs (Mistral Large 2, Deepseek-R1, LLaMA 3.3 70B) using 25 synthetic personas
under three conditions: Natural-language Persona Steering (NPS), Schema-Based
Steering (SBS), and Hybrid Persona-Schema Steering (HPS). Results demonstrate
that schema-based approaches significantly reduce artificial-sounding persona
repetition while improving output coherence, with silhouette scores increasing
from 0.098 to 0.237 and topic purity from 0.773 to 0.957. Our analysis reveals
a fundamental trade-off: SBS produces more concise outputs with higher topical
consistency, while NPS offers greater lexical diversity but reduced
predictability. HPS achieves a balance between these extremes, maintaining
output variety while preserving structural consistency. Expert linguistic
evaluation confirms that PILOT maintains high response quality across all
conditions, with no statistically significant differences between steering
approaches.

### [14] [Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Spoken Sarcasm Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15476)
*Zhu Li,Xiyuan Gao,Yuqing Zhang,Shekhar Nayak,Matt Coler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs and multimodal LLMs for sarcasm detection across English and Chinese datasets, finding that audio-based models perform best unimodally, while text-audio and audio-vision combinations outperform unimodal and trimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection is challenging due to subtle cross-modal cues, and comprehensive audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding remains underexplored compared to text-only or visual-textual approaches.

Method: Systematically evaluate LLMs and MLLMs on English (MUStARD++) and Chinese (MCSD 1.0) datasets using zero-shot, few-shot, and LoRA fine-tuning settings, including direct classification and feature encoding with collaborative gating fusion.

Result: Audio-based models achieved strongest unimodal performance; text-audio and audio-vision combinations outperformed unimodal and trimodal models; MLLMs like Qwen-Omni showed competitive zero-shot and fine-tuned performance.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of MLLMs for cross-lingual, audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection remains a challenge in natural language understanding, as
sarcastic intent often relies on subtle cross-modal cues spanning text, speech,
and vision. While prior work has primarily focused on textual or visual-textual
sarcasm, comprehensive audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding remains
underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate large language models
(LLMs) and multimodal LLMs for sarcasm detection on English (MUStARD++) and
Chinese (MCSD 1.0) in zero-shot, few-shot, and LoRA fine-tuning settings. In
addition to direct classification, we explore models as feature encoders,
integrating their representations through a collaborative gating fusion module.
Experimental results show that audio-based models achieve the strongest
unimodal performance, while text-audio and audio-vision combinations outperform
unimodal and trimodal models. Furthermore, MLLMs such as Qwen-Omni show
competitive zero-shot and fine-tuned performance. Our findings highlight the
potential of MLLMs for cross-lingual, audio-visual-textual sarcasm

### [15] [Red Teaming Multimodal Language Models: Evaluating Harm Across Prompt Modalities and Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15478)
*Madison Van Doren,Casey Ford,Emily Dix*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the safety of four leading multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against adversarial prompts, finding significant differences in vulnerability across models and modalities, with Pixtral 12B being most vulnerable and Claude Sonnet 3.5 most resistant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are increasingly used in real-world applications but their safety under adversarial conditions remains underexplored, creating an urgent need for robust safety evaluation.

Method: 26 red teamers generated 726 adversarial prompts targeting illegal activity, disinformation, and unethical behavior. These were tested on four MLLMs (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, Qwen VL Plus) across text-only and multimodal formats. 17 annotators rated 2,904 model outputs for harmfulness using a 5-point scale.

Result: Pixtral 12B had the highest harmful response rate (~62%), Claude Sonnet 3.5 was most resistant (~10%). Text-only prompts were slightly more effective than multimodal ones. Both model type and input modality were statistically significant predictors of harmfulness.

Conclusion: Findings underscore the urgent need for robust, multimodal safety benchmarks as MLLMs are deployed more widely, highlighting significant safety vulnerabilities that vary by model and modality.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used in real world
applications, yet their safety under adversarial conditions remains
underexplored. This study evaluates the harmlessness of four leading MLLMs
(GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus) when exposed to
adversarial prompts across text-only and multimodal formats. A team of 26 red
teamers generated 726 prompts targeting three harm categories: illegal
activity, disinformation, and unethical behaviour. These prompts were submitted
to each model, and 17 annotators rated 2,904 model outputs for harmfulness
using a 5-point scale. Results show significant differences in vulnerability
across models and modalities. Pixtral 12B exhibited the highest rate of harmful
responses (~62%), while Claude Sonnet 3.5 was the most resistant (~10%).
Contrary to expectations, text-only prompts were slightly more effective at
bypassing safety mechanisms than multimodal ones. Statistical analysis
confirmed that both model type and input modality were significant predictors
of harmfulness. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust,
multimodal safety benchmarks as MLLMs are deployed more widely.

*Ahmed Abdou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple post-processing technique using conformal prediction for Arabic readability classification that improves model performance by 1-3 QWK points through uncertainty-aware decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fine-grained Arabic readability classification (19 ordinal levels) by reducing high-penalty misclassifications and providing statistical guarantees for practical educational assessment use.

Method: Model-agnostic conformal prediction that generates prediction sets with coverage guarantees, then computes weighted averages using softmax-renormalized probabilities over the conformal sets.

Result: Achieved QWK scores of 84.9%(test) and 85.7%(blind test) for sentence level, and 73.3% for document level in the BAREC 2025 Shared Task, with consistent 1-3 point QWK improvements across different base models.

Conclusion: The approach enables human reviewers to focus on plausible levels by combining statistical guarantees with practical usability for Arabic educational assessment.

Abstract: We present a simple, model-agnostic post-processing technique for
fine-grained Arabic readability classification in the BAREC 2025 Shared Task
(19 ordinal levels). Our method applies conformal prediction to generate
prediction sets with coverage guarantees, then computes weighted averages using
softmax-renormalized probabilities over the conformal sets. This
uncertainty-aware decoding improves Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) by reducing
high-penalty misclassifications to nearer levels. Our approach shows consistent
QWK improvements of 1-3 points across different base models. In the strict
track, our submission achieves QWK scores of 84.9\%(test) and 85.7\% (blind
test) for sentence level, and 73.3\% for document level. For Arabic educational
assessment, this enables human reviewers to focus on a handful of plausible
levels, combining statistical guarantees with practical usability.

### [17] [LLM Cache Bandit Revisited: Addressing Query Heterogeneity for Cost-Effective LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15515)
*Hantao Yang,Hong Xie,Defu Lian,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the LLM cache bandit problem with heterogeneous query sizes, treating cache selection as a knapsack problem and achieving improved regret bounds and 12% cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works assume uniform query sizes, but heterogeneous query sizes introduce combinatorial complexity in cache selection, making the problem more challenging computationally and statistically.

Method: Treat optimal cache selection as a knapsack problem and employ an accumulation-based strategy to balance computational overhead and cache updates effectively.

Result: The algorithm achieves an O(‚àöMNT) regret bound, improving upon the previous O(MN‚àöT) bound, and provides a problem-dependent bound. Experiments show approximately 12% total cost reduction using real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles query heterogeneity in LLM cache optimization, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical cost savings.

Abstract: This paper revisits the LLM cache bandit problem, with a special focus on
addressing the query heterogeneity for cost-effective LLM inference. Previous
works often assume uniform query sizes. Heterogeneous query sizes introduce a
combinatorial structure for cache selection, making the cache replacement
process more computationally and statistically challenging. We treat optimal
cache selection as a knapsack problem and employ an accumulation-based strategy
to effectively balance computational overhead and cache updates. In theoretical
analysis, we prove that the regret of our algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{MNT})$
bound, improving the coefficient of $\sqrt{MN}$ compared to the $O(MN\sqrt{T})$
result in Berkeley, where $N$ is the total number of queries and $M$ is the
cache size. Additionally, we also provide a problem-dependent bound, which was
absent in previous works. The experiment rely on real-world data show that our
algorithm reduces the total cost by approximately 12\%.

### [18] [How do Language Models Generate Slang: A Systematic Comparison between Human and Machine-Generated Slang Usages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15518)
*Siyang Wu,Zhewei Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares human and machine-generated slang usages to evaluate LLMs' understanding of slang structure and creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs have captured structural knowledge about slang that aligns with human-attested usages, as LLM agents are increasingly used for slang detection and interpretation tasks.

Method: Developed an evaluative framework comparing human slang from Online Slang Dictionary with GPT-4o and Llama-3 generated slang, focusing on systematic biases, creativity (lexical coinages and word reuses), and informativeness for model distillation.

Result: Found significant biases in how LLMs perceive slang. LLMs captured significant knowledge about creative aspects of slang but this knowledge doesn't sufficiently align with humans for extrapolative tasks like linguistic analyses.

Conclusion: While LLMs have learned creative aspects of slang, their understanding doesn't align well enough with human usage to enable reliable performance on linguistic analysis tasks requiring human-like slang comprehension.

Abstract: Slang is a commonly used type of informal language that poses a daunting
challenge to NLP systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs),
however, have made the problem more approachable. While LLM agents are becoming
more widely applied to intermediary tasks such as slang detection and slang
interpretation, their generalizability and reliability are heavily dependent on
whether these models have captured structural knowledge about slang that align
well with human attested slang usages. To answer this question, we contribute a
systematic comparison between human and machine-generated slang usages. Our
evaluative framework focuses on three core aspects: 1) Characteristics of the
usages that reflect systematic biases in how machines perceive slang, 2)
Creativity reflected by both lexical coinages and word reuses employed by the
slang usages, and 3) Informativeness of the slang usages when used as
gold-standard examples for model distillation. By comparing human-attested
slang usages from the Online Slang Dictionary (OSD) and slang generated by
GPT-4o and Llama-3, we find significant biases in how LLMs perceive slang. Our
results suggest that while LLMs have captured significant knowledge about the
creative aspects of slang, such knowledge does not align with humans
sufficiently to enable LLMs for extrapolative tasks such as linguistic
analyses.

TL;DR: M-DaQ is a novel method for selecting high-quality and diverse multilingual instruction fine-tuning data, addressing data scarcity issues and improving LLM performance across 18 languages with over 60% win rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual IFT is crucial for LLM generalization but faces data scarcity. Existing data selection methods fail across languages due to simplistic heuristics and language-specific assumptions.

Method: Introduces Multilingual Data Quality and Diversity (M-DaQ) method that selects high-quality and semantically diverse multilingual IFT samples. Also investigates the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis in multilingual settings.

Result: Models fine-tuned with M-DaQ achieve significant performance gains with over 60% win rate across 18 languages. Human evaluations show increased cultural relevance in responses.

Conclusion: M-DaQ effectively improves LLM multilinguality by addressing data quality and diversity issues. The method and code are released to support future research.

Abstract: Multilingual Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is essential for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to generalize effectively across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. However, the scarcity of high-quality multilingual training
data and corresponding building method remains a critical bottleneck. While
data selection has shown promise in English settings, existing methods often
fail to generalize across languages due to reliance on simplistic heuristics or
language-specific assumptions. In this work, we introduce Multilingual Data
Quality and Diversity (M-DaQ), a novel method for improving LLMs
multilinguality, by selecting high-quality and semantically diverse
multilingual IFT samples. We further conduct the first systematic investigation
of the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis (SAH) in multilingual setting.
Empirical results across 18 languages demonstrate that models fine-tuned with
M-DaQ method achieve significant performance gains over vanilla baselines over
60% win rate. Human evaluations further validate these gains, highlighting the
increment of cultural points in the response. We release the M-DaQ code to
support future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DNA-DetectLLM is a zero-shot AI-generated text detection method inspired by DNA repair processes, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 5.55% AUROC and 2.08% F1 score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The blurring line between AI-generated and human-written text creates societal risks like misinformation and authorship ambiguity, requiring reliable detection methods as current approaches struggle with overlapping feature distributions.

Method: Proposes a DNA-inspired perspective using repair-based process to capture intrinsic differences. DNA-DetectLLM constructs ideal AI-generated sequences, iteratively repairs non-optimal tokens, and quantifies cumulative repair effort as interpretable detection signal.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with strong robustness against adversarial attacks and input lengths. Shows 5.55% AUROC and 2.08% F1 score improvements across multiple public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The DNA-inspired repair-based approach provides an effective and interpretable solution for distinguishing AI-generated text, addressing current limitations in detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has blurred the line
between AI-generated and human-written text. This progress brings societal
risks such as misinformation, authorship ambiguity, and intellectual property
concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated text detection
methods. However, recent advances in generative language modeling have resulted
in significant overlap between the feature distributions of human-written and
AI-generated text, blurring classification boundaries and making accurate
detection increasingly challenging. To address the above challenges, we propose
a DNA-inspired perspective, leveraging a repair-based process to directly and
interpretably capture the intrinsic differences between human-written and
AI-generated text. Building on this perspective, we introduce DNA-DetectLLM, a
zero-shot detection method for distinguishing AI-generated and human-written
text. The method constructs an ideal AI-generated sequence for each input,
iteratively repairs non-optimal tokens, and quantifies the cumulative repair
effort as an interpretable detection signal. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and exhibits
strong robustness against various adversarial attacks and input lengths.
Specifically, DNA-DetectLLM achieves relative improvements of 5.55% in AUROC
and 2.08% in F1 score across multiple public benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Climb is a framework that optimizes multilingual data allocation for LLMs by quantifying cross-lingual interactions and using a two-step optimization process to achieve state-of-the-art multilingual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to determine optimal language proportions in training corpora due to complex cross-lingual interactions and sensitivity to dataset scale, creating a need for systematic optimization.

Method: Introduces cross-lingual interaction-aware language ratios to quantify effective allocations, then uses a two-step optimization: equalizing marginal benefits across languages and maximizing allocation vector magnitude.

Result: Climb accurately measures cross-lingual interactions and achieves SOTA multilingual performance, even matching open-sourced LLMs trained with more tokens.

Conclusion: The framework successfully simplifies multilingual optimization and delivers superior multilingual capabilities for LLMs through principled data allocation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to a wide range of
applications worldwide, driving an unprecedented global demand for effective
multilingual capabilities. Central to achieving robust multilingual performance
is the strategic allocation of language proportions within training corpora.
However, determining optimal language ratios is highly challenging due to
intricate cross-lingual interactions and sensitivity to dataset scale. This
paper introduces Climb (Cross-Lingual Interaction-aware Multilingual
Balancing), a novel framework designed to systematically optimize multilingual
data allocation. At its core, Climb introduces a cross-lingual
interaction-aware language ratio, explicitly quantifying each language's
effective allocation by capturing inter-language dependencies. Leveraging this
ratio, Climb proposes a principled two-step optimization procedure--first
equalizing marginal benefits across languages, then maximizing the magnitude of
the resulting language allocation vectors--significantly simplifying the
inherently complex multilingual optimization problem. Extensive experiments
confirm that Climb can accurately measure cross-lingual interactions across
various multilingual settings. LLMs trained with Climb-derived proportions
consistently achieve state-of-the-art multilingual performance, even achieving
competitive performance with open-sourced LLMs trained with more tokens.

### [22] [How important is language for human-like intelligence?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15560)
*Gary Lupyan,Hunter Gentry,Martin Zettersten*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language is not just for expressing thoughts but plays a transformative role in cognition, enabling thoughts that wouldn't exist otherwise. Recent AI advances suggest language may be key to developing general intelligence by providing compressed representations of abstract concepts and culturally evolved knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language merely expresses pre-existing thoughts or actively shapes human cognition, and explore how language could enable more general AI systems by providing compressed representations of complex concepts.

Method: Analyzing language's dual properties: (1) compact representations that facilitate reasoning about abstract concepts, and (2) these representations as culturally evolved abstractions accumulated over generations.

Result: Language serves as a powerful tool that allows learning systems to develop compressed models of the world, reverse-engineering conceptual and causal structures that support human-like thought.

Conclusion: Language holds transformative power in cognition and AI development, enabling the emergence of domain-general abilities through exposure to culturally evolved compressed representations of knowledge.

Abstract: We use language to communicate our thoughts. But is language merely the
expression of thoughts, which are themselves produced by other, nonlinguistic
parts of our minds? Or does language play a more transformative role in human
cognition, allowing us to have thoughts that we otherwise could (or would) not
have? Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science
have reinvigorated this old question. We argue that language may hold the key
to the emergence of both more general AI systems and central aspects of human
intelligence. We highlight two related properties of language that make it such
a powerful tool for developing domain--general abilities. First, language
offers compact representations that make it easier to represent and reason
about many abstract concepts (e.g., exact numerosity). Second, these compressed
representations are the iterated output of collective minds. In learning a
language, we learn a treasure trove of culturally evolved abstractions. Taken
together, these properties mean that a sufficiently powerful learning system
exposed to language--whether biological or artificial--learns a compressed
model of the world, reverse engineering many of the conceptual and causal
structures that support human (and human-like) thought.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for synthesizing long-context data using relevance-based aggregation face computational efficiency challenges, making high-quality long-context data synthesis expensive and inaccessible.

Method: Uses BISAC book classification system for hierarchical topic organization, multi-agent debate with LLMs to generate diverse topics, and lightweight BM25 retrieval to concatenate relevant documents into 128K-token training samples.

Result: Experiments on HELMET and Ruler benchmarks show competitive long-context performance and seamless integration with other long-dependency enhancement methods.

Conclusion: LiteLong makes high-quality long-context data synthesis more accessible by reducing computational and data engineering costs, facilitating further research in long-context language training.

Abstract: High-quality long-context data is essential for training large language
models (LLMs) capable of processing extensive documents, yet existing synthesis
approaches using relevance-based aggregation face challenges of computational
efficiency. We present LiteLong, a resource-efficient method for synthesizing
long-context data through structured topic organization and multi-agent debate.
Our approach leverages the BISAC book classification system to provide a
comprehensive hierarchical topic organization, and then employs a debate
mechanism with multiple LLMs to generate diverse, high-quality topics within
this structure. For each topic, we use lightweight BM25 retrieval to obtain
relevant documents and concatenate them into 128K-token training samples.
Experiments on HELMET and Ruler benchmarks demonstrate that LiteLong achieves
competitive long-context performance and can seamlessly integrate with other
long-dependency enhancement methods. LiteLong makes high-quality long-context
data synthesis more accessible by reducing both computational and data
engineering costs, facilitating further research in long-context language
training.

*Jaeyoung Kim,Jongho Kim,Seung-won Hwang,Seoho Song,Young-In Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2U proposes a novel approach to bridge the gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility in RAG systems by directly optimizing for correct answer generation through process supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bridge modules in RAG systems fail to capture true document utility despite retrieving topically relevant documents, creating a gap between retrieval optimization and effective generation.

Method: Proposes R2U with direct optimization to maximize probability of generating correct answers through process supervision, using an efficient distillation pipeline that scales supervision from LLMs to help smaller rewriter models generalize better.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple open-domain question-answering benchmarks demonstrates consistent improvements over strong bridging baselines.

Conclusion: R2U effectively addresses the utility gap in RAG systems by optimizing for generative success rather than just retrieval relevance, showing superior performance through process-supervised training.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems often suffer from a gap between
optimizing retrieval relevance and generative utility: retrieved documents may
be topically relevant but still lack the content needed for effective reasoning
during generation. While existing "bridge" modules attempt to rewrite the
retrieved text for better generation, we show how they fail to capture true
document utility. In this work, we propose R2U, with a key distinction of
directly optimizing to maximize the probability of generating a correct answer
through process supervision. As such direct observation is expensive, we also
propose approximating an efficient distillation pipeline by scaling the
supervision from LLMs, which helps the smaller rewriter model generalize
better. We evaluate our method across multiple open-domain question-answering
benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong bridging baselines.

*Yun Tang,Cindy Tseng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chunk SSL is a self-supervised learning algorithm for streaming and offline speech pre-training using chunk-based masked prediction with finite scalar quantization and group masked prediction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low latency speech communication requires streaming applications, but most self-supervised learning algorithms assume full utterances and compromise on partial utterances. Chunk SSL provides a unified solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training.

Method: Proposes chunk-based self-supervised learning with masked prediction loss, finite scalar quantization (FSQ) for discretization, copy-and-append data augmentation, and group masked prediction loss to handle large codebooks efficiently.

Result: Experimental results on Librispeech and Must-C datasets show competitive performance in speech recognition and speech translation tasks for both streaming and offline modes.

Conclusion: Chunk SSL effectively addresses the limitations of full-utterance SSL algorithms in streaming applications and achieves strong performance in speech-to-text tasks through chunk-based pre-training with efficient quantization techniques.

Abstract: Low latency speech human-machine communication is becoming increasingly
necessary as speech technology advances quickly in the last decade. One of the
primary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised
learning. Most self-supervised learning algorithms are designed with full
utterance assumption and compromises have to made if partial utterances are
presented, which are common in the streaming applications. In this work, we
propose a chunk based self-supervised learning (Chunk SSL) algorithm as an
unified solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training. Chunk SSL
is optimized with the masked prediction loss and an acoustic encoder is
encouraged to restore indices of those masked speech frames with help from
unmasked frames in the same chunk and preceding chunks. A copy and append data
augmentation approach is proposed to conduct efficient chunk based
pre-training. Chunk SSL utilizes a finite scalar quantization (FSQ) module to
discretize input speech features and our study shows a high resolution FSQ
codebook, i.e., a codebook with vocabulary size up to a few millions, is
beneficial to transfer knowledge from the pre-training task to the downstream
tasks. A group masked prediction loss is employed during pre-training to
alleviate the high memory and computation cost introduced by the large
codebook. The proposed approach is examined in two speech to text tasks, i.e.,
speech recognition and speech translation. Experimental results on the
\textsc{Librispeech} and \textsc{Must-C} datasets show that the proposed method
could achieve very competitive results for speech to text tasks at both
streaming and offline modes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DivLogicEval, a new classical logic benchmark using natural language sentences composed of diverse statements in counterintuitive ways, with a new evaluation metric to mitigate LLM biases and randomness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logic reasoning benchmarks have limitations: they entangle multiple reasoning skills, lack language diversity, and have distributions deviated from ideal logic reasoning benchmarks, leading to unfaithful and biased evaluations of LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created DivLogicEval benchmark with natural sentences using diverse statements arranged counterintuitively. Introduced a new evaluation metric specifically designed to reduce the influence of bias and randomness in LLMs during logical reasoning assessment.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that DivLogicEval effectively requires logical reasoning to answer questions and provided comparative performance analysis of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DivLogicEval offers a more reliable benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in LLMs by addressing limitations of existing benchmarks through diverse language construction and bias-mitigating evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important
measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular
benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful
evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning
benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are
deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may
lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical
logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of
diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable
evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the
influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we
demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the
questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs
in conducting logical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scientific information extraction (SciIE) relies on entity-relation extraction in narrow domains, which limits applicability to interdisciplinary research and struggles to capture necessary context, often resulting in fragmented or conflicting statements.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-stage event extraction pipeline: (1) segmenting abstracts into core scientific activities (Background, Method, Result, Conclusion), and (2) extracting corresponding triggers and arguments. They created a benchmark with 500 abstracts across five research domains with manual annotations.

Result: Experiments with fine-tuned EE models, LLMs, and human annotators reveal a performance gap, with current models struggling in domains like sociology and humanities.

Conclusion: SciEvent serves as a challenging benchmark and represents a step toward generalizable, multi-domain scientific information extraction.

Abstract: Scientific information extraction (SciIE) has primarily relied on
entity-relation extraction in narrow domains, limiting its applicability to

benchmark of scientific abstracts annotated via a unified event extraction (EE)
schema designed to enable structured and context-aware understanding of
scientific content. It includes 500 abstracts across five research domains,

abstracts into core scientific activities--Background, Method, Result, and
Conclusion; and (2) extracting the corresponding triggers and arguments.
Experiments with fine-tuned EE models, large language models (LLMs), and human

*Tomoya Yamashita,Yuuki Yamanaka,Masanori Yamada,Takayuki Miura,Toshiki Shibahara,Tomoharu Iwata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Unlearning (CU) as a new approach for machine unlearning in LLMs that removes broader concepts (like persons or events) rather than just specific sentences, using knowledge graphs to represent and target internal knowledge structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods only remove specific target sentences and cannot handle broader concept removal, which limits their applicability to privacy and copyright issues involving entire concepts rather than individual sentences.

Method: The authors propose using knowledge graphs to represent LLM knowledge, define CU as removing target nodes and edges, prompt the LLM to generate knowledge triplets and explanatory sentences about forgetting targets, and apply unlearning to these graph representations.

Result: Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show the method effectively achieves concept-level unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge.

Conclusion: The graph-based formulation enables more intuitive and effective concept unlearning by aligning the unlearning process with the LLM's internal knowledge representations, providing a more comprehensive solution for privacy and copyright protection.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) has recently attracted considerable attention as a
solution to privacy and copyright issues in large language models (LLMs).
Existing MU methods aim to remove specific target sentences from an LLM while
minimizing damage to unrelated knowledge. However, these approaches require
explicit target sentences and do not support removing broader concepts, such as
persons or events. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept Unlearning
(CU) as a new requirement for LLM unlearning. We leverage knowledge graphs to
represent the LLM's internal knowledge and define CU as removing the forgetting
target nodes and associated edges. This graph-based formulation enables a more
intuitive unlearning and facilitates the design of more effective methods. We
propose a novel method that prompts the LLM to generate knowledge triplets and
explanatory sentences about the forgetting target and applies the unlearning
process to these representations. Our approach enables more precise and
comprehensive concept removal by aligning the unlearning process with the LLM's
internal knowledge representations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method effectively achieves concept-level
unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge.

*Tomoya Yamashita,Akira Ito,Yuuki Yamanaka,Masanori Yamada,Takayuki Miura,Toshiki Shibahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel LLM unlearning method that directly intervenes in internal activations to shift forgotten targets from 'known' to 'unknown' states, avoiding suppression-based issues like model collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing suppression-based unlearning methods only mute responses without eliminating underlying knowledge, and often cause model collapse. There's a need for genuine forgetting that removes internal representations.

Method: Proposes an unlearning objective that modifies target entity activations away from known entities toward unknown entities in sparse autoencoder latent space, making forgotten targets indistinguishable from unknown entities.

Result: Effectively aligns internal activations of forgotten targets (which suppression methods fail to do), reduces recall of target knowledge in QA tasks without significant damage to non-target knowledge.

Conclusion: The method achieves genuine forgetting by shifting model's recognition from 'known' to 'unknown', avoiding over-suppression and model collapse while maintaining performance on non-target knowledge.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various
applications, privacy and copyright concerns have heightened the need for more
effective LLM unlearning techniques. Many existing unlearning methods aim to
suppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient
ascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such
suppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate
the underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a
response is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based
methods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a
novel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal
activations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the
activation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown''
entities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the
activation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward
those of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the
target's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the
model's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'',
achieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model
collapse. Empirically, we show that our method effectively aligns the internal
activations of the forgotten target, a result that the suppression-based
approaches do not reliably achieve. Additionally, our method effectively
reduces the model's recall of target knowledge in question-answering tasks
without significant damage to the non-target knowledge.

*Nhu Vo,Nu-Uyen-Phuong Le,Dung D. Le,Massimo Piccardi,Wray Buntine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of multilingual LLMs for English-Vietnamese medical translation shows model scale is key, with terminology-aware prompting providing consistent improvements over few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical English-Vietnamese translation is crucial for healthcare in Vietnam, but Vietnamese is a low-resource language that's under-studied in machine translation.

Method: Systematically evaluated six multilingual LLMs (0.5B-9B parameters) on MedEV dataset using zero-shot, few-shot, and dictionary-augmented prompting with Meddict medical lexicon.

Result: Larger LLMs achieve strong zero-shot results, few-shot prompting provides only marginal improvements, but terminology-aware cues and embedding-based retrieval consistently improve domain-specific translation.

Conclusion: Multilingual LLMs show promise for medical En-Vi MT but have current limitations, with model scale being the primary performance driver.

Abstract: Medical English-Vietnamese machine translation (En-Vi MT) is essential for
healthcare access and communication in Vietnam, yet Vietnamese remains a
low-resource and under-studied language. We systematically evaluate prompting
strategies for six multilingual LLMs (0.5B-9B parameters) on the MedEV dataset,
comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and dictionary-augmented prompting with Meddict,
an English-Vietnamese medical lexicon. Results show that model scale is the
primary driver of performance: larger LLMs achieve strong zero-shot results,
while few-shot prompting yields only marginal improvements. In contrast,
terminology-aware cues and embedding-based example retrieval consistently
improve domain-specific translation. These findings underscore both the promise
and the current limitations of multilingual LLMs for medical En-Vi MT.

*Linyang He,Qiaolin Wang,Xilin Jiang,Nima Mesgarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study systematically evaluates how well speech language models (SLMs) encode contextual syntactic and semantic features across different model types, finding that all speech models encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While previous research has examined shallow acoustic and phonetic features in SLMs, it remains unclear to what extent these models encode nuanced syntactic and conceptual features. The study aims to bridge this gap by drawing parallels with linguistic competence assessments for large language models.

Method: The researchers used minimal pair designs and diagnostic feature analysis across 71 tasks spanning diverse linguistic levels. They conducted layer-wise and time-resolved analysis of SLMs for self-supervised learning (S3M), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech compression (codec), and as encoders for auditory large language models (AudioLLMs).

Result: The analysis revealed that all speech models encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual features.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic evaluation showing that speech language models demonstrate stronger encoding of syntactic features compared to semantic/conceptual features across various model architectures and applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based speech language models (SLMs) have significantly improved
neural speech recognition and understanding. While existing research has
examined how well SLMs encode shallow acoustic and phonetic features, the
extent to which SLMs encode nuanced syntactic and conceptual features remains
unclear. By drawing parallels with linguistic competence assessments for large
language models, this study is the first to systematically evaluate the
presence of contextual syntactic and semantic features across SLMs for
self-supervised learning (S3M), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech
compression (codec), and as the encoder for auditory large language models
(AudioLLMs). Through minimal pair designs and diagnostic feature analysis
across 71 tasks spanning diverse linguistic levels, our layer-wise and
time-resolved analysis uncovers that 1) all speech encode grammatical features
more robustly than conceptual ones.

TL;DR: A multimodal fusion framework that bridges LLMs and acoustic models using audio-conditioned text space for alignment, achieving state-of-the-art Greek ASR with 20% relative improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build speech-enabled LLMs by effectively aligning audio and text representations, particularly for multilingual and low-resource scenarios like Greek speech processing.

Method: Uses intermediate audio-conditioned text space for alignment, fusing Whisper's decoder states with LLM states through cross-modal attention in continuous text representation spaces, supporting both offline and streaming modes.

Result: Developed VoxKrikri (first Greek speech LLM) with effective cross-modal alignment and achieved state-of-the-art Greek ASR results with ~20% relative improvement across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Continuous space fusion is a promising approach for multilingual and low-resource speech LLMs, demonstrating effective representation alignment and significant performance improvements.

Abstract: We present a multimodal fusion framework that bridges pre-trained
decoder-based large language models (LLM) and acoustic encoder-decoder
architectures such as Whisper, with the aim of building speech-enabled LLMs.
Instead of directly using audio embeddings, we explore an intermediate
audio-conditioned text space as a more effective mechanism for alignment. Our
method operates fully in continuous text representation spaces, fusing
Whisper's hidden decoder states with those of an LLM through cross-modal
attention, and supports both offline and streaming modes. We introduce
\textit{VoxKrikri}, the first Greek speech LLM, and show through analysis that
our approach effectively aligns representations across modalities. These
results highlight continuous space fusion as a promising path for multilingual
and low-resource speech LLMs, while achieving state-of-the-art results for
Automatic Speech Recognition in Greek, providing an average $\sim20\%$ relative
improvement across benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for Automatic Pronunciation Assessment shows significant improvements over zero-shot approaches, achieving competitive results at word and sentence levels, though phoneme-level assessment remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA) is critical for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), requiring evaluation across multiple granularities and aspects. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) present new opportunities for APA, but their effectiveness in fine-grained assessment remains uncertain.

Method: This work investigates fine-tuning LMMs for APA using the Speechocean762 dataset and a private corpus, comparing performance against zero-shot settings and existing public/commercial systems.

Result: Fine-tuning significantly outperforms zero-shot settings and achieves competitive results on single-granularity tasks. The model performs well at word and sentence levels, while phoneme-level assessment remains challenging. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) reaches 0.9, whereas Spearman's rank Correlation Coefficient (SCC) remains around 0.6.

Conclusion: These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LMMs for APA and point to future work on fine-grained modeling and rank-aware evaluation, suggesting that SCC better reflects ordinal consistency.

*Jonas Mayer Martins,Ali Hamza Bashir,Muhammad Rehan Khalid,Lisa Beinborn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training language models with high-level cognitive feedback (readability, coherence, creativity) instead of just next-word prediction can achieve similar storytelling improvements with 410x less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children learn language through social interaction and feedback, while LLMs are typically trained on massive text corpora with next-word prediction. This contrast motivates exploring more data-efficient training methods inspired by human learning.

Method: Train a student model to generate stories, which a teacher model rates on readability, narrative coherence, and creativity. Vary pretraining amounts before implementing the feedback loop to assess interactive learning impact.

Result: High-level feedback is highly data efficient: with just 1M words of input in interactive learning, storytelling skills improve as much as with 410M words of next-word prediction training.

Conclusion: Interactive learning with cognitive feedback can dramatically reduce the data requirements for training language models while achieving comparable performance improvements in storytelling capabilities.

Abstract: Children efficiently acquire language not just by listening, but by
interacting with others in their social environment. Conversely, large language
models are typically trained with next-word prediction on massive amounts of
text. Motivated by this contrast, we investigate whether language models can be
trained with less data by learning not only from next-word prediction but also
from high-level, cognitively inspired feedback. We train a student model to
generate stories, which a teacher model rates on readability, narrative
coherence, and creativity. By varying the amount of pretraining before the
feedback loop, we assess the impact of this interactive learning on formal and
functional linguistic competence. We find that the high-level feedback is
highly data efficient: With just 1 M words of input in interactive learning,
storytelling skills can improve as much as with 410 M words of next-word
prediction.

*Nannan Huang,Haytham M. Fayek,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces REFER, a frequency-framed prompting method that enhances fairness in LLM opinion summarization by adapting cognitive science techniques to reduce biases, without requiring hyperparameter tuning or ground truth distributional information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous fairness methods in opinion summarization rely on impractical approaches like hyperparameter tuning or providing ground truth distributional information, which are not feasible for end-users who rarely modify default parameters and often lack accurate distributional data.

Method: The study adapts frequency-based representations from cognitive science research to create REFER (frequency framed prompting), which makes reference classes explicit and reduces cognitive load. This approach is systematically tested with different prompting frameworks to improve information processing in language models compared to abstract probabilistic representations.

Result: REFER significantly enhances fairness in language models when summarizing opinions, with the effect being particularly pronounced in larger language models and when using stronger reasoning instructions.

Conclusion: Frequency-framed prompting (REFER) provides an effective and practical solution for improving fairness in LLM opinion summarization by leveraging cognitive science principles, offering advantages over previous methods that required impractical user interventions.

Abstract: Individuals express diverse opinions, a fair summary should represent these
viewpoints comprehensively. Previous research on fairness in opinion
summarisation using large language models (LLMs) relied on hyperparameter
tuning or providing ground truth distributional information in prompts.
However, these methods face practical limitations: end-users rarely modify
default model parameters, and accurate distributional information is often
unavailable. Building upon cognitive science research demonstrating that
frequency-based representations reduce systematic biases in human statistical
reasoning by making reference classes explicit and reducing cognitive load,
this study investigates whether frequency framed prompting (REFER) can
similarly enhance fairness in LLM opinion summarisation. Through systematic
experimentation with different prompting frameworks, we adapted techniques
known to improve human reasoning to elicit more effective information
processing in language models compared to abstract probabilistic
representations.Our results demonstrate that REFER enhances fairness in
language models when summarising opinions. This effect is particularly
pronounced in larger language models and using stronger reasoning instructions.

*Reza Sanayei,Srdjan Vesic,Eduardo Blanco,Mihai Surdeanu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can moderately approximate structured reasoning from Computational Argumentation Theory using QuAD semantics to rank arguments in debates, but performance degrades with longer inputs or disrupted discourse flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can approximate structured reasoning from Computational Argumentation Theory on non-linear argument structures found in natural debates, which are best expressed as argument graphs.

Method: Using Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) semantics to assign acceptability scores to arguments based on attack and support relations. Testing LLMs with advanced instruction strategies like Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning on dialogue-formatted debates from NoDE datasets.

Result: LLMs show moderate alignment with QuAD rankings, but performance degrades with longer inputs or disrupted discourse flow. Advanced prompting helps mitigate biases related to argument length and position.

Conclusion: The findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LLMs in modeling formal argumentation semantics and motivate future work on graph-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at linear reasoning tasks but remain
underexplored on non-linear structures such as those found in natural debates,
which are best expressed as argument graphs. We evaluate whether LLMs can
approximate structured reasoning from Computational Argumentation Theory (CAT).
Specifically, we use Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) semantics, which
assigns acceptability scores to arguments based on their attack and support
relations. Given only dialogue-formatted debates from two NoDE datasets, models
are prompted to rank arguments without access to the underlying graph. We test
several LLMs under advanced instruction strategies, including Chain-of-Thought
and In-Context Learning. While models show moderate alignment with QuAD
rankings, performance degrades with longer inputs or disrupted discourse flow.
Advanced prompting helps mitigate these effects by reducing biases related to
argument length and position. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LLMs in modeling formal argumentation semantics and motivate
future work on graph-aware reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniGist is a sequence-level long-context compression framework that replaces raw tokens with special compression tokens (gists) to reduce KV cache memory overhead while preserving important contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face memory bottlenecks from KV cache overhead when handling long-context inputs. Existing sequence-level compression methods risk losing important contextual information when dropping full KV caches.

Method: Uses a chunk-free training strategy with special compression tokens (gists) that replace raw tokens in a fine-grained manner. Features an efficient kernel with gist shift trick for optimized GPU training and supports flexible inference by allowing actual removal of compressed tokens.

Result: Significantly improves compression quality across multiple long-context tasks, with particularly strong performance in detail-recalling tasks and long-range dependency modeling.

Conclusion: UniGist effectively addresses KV cache memory bottlenecks while maintaining contextual information quality, enabling real-time memory savings during inference.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of handling long-context
inputs, but the memory overhead of key-value (KV) cache remains a major
bottleneck for general-purpose deployment. While various compression strategies
have been explored, sequence-level compression, which drops the full KV caches
for certain tokens, is particularly challenging as it can lead to the loss of
important contextual information. To address this, we introduce UniGist, a
sequence-level long-context compression framework that efficiently preserves
context information by replacing raw tokens with special compression tokens
(gists) in a fine-grained manner. We adopt a chunk-free training strategy and
design an efficient kernel with a gist shift trick, enabling optimized GPU
training. Our scheme also supports flexible inference by allowing the actual
removal of compressed tokens, resulting in real-time memory savings.
Experiments across multiple long-context tasks demonstrate that UniGist
significantly improves compression quality, with especially strong performance
in detail-recalling tasks and long-range dependency modeling.

Method: Complete end-to-end solution with web scraping and Graph-Aided Paragraph Alignment (GAPA) algorithm for paragraph-level alignment, featuring reproducible single-machine and distributed computing options.

Result: Corpus contains over 713 million English tokens, more than doubling prior work's scale, representing the largest publicly available parallel corpus of human-translated content.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses reproducibility and scalability issues in corpus building, providing a valuable resource for machine translation research under MIT License.

Abstract: The quality and accessibility of multilingual datasets are crucial for
advancing machine translation. However, previous corpora built from United
Nations documents have suffered from issues such as opaque process, difficulty
of reproduction, and limited scale. To address these challenges, we introduce a
complete end-to-end solution, from data acquisition via web scraping to text

resulting corpus contains over 713 million English tokens, more than doubling
the scale of prior work. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current claim detection methods struggle with vague political discourse and diverse formats like tweets, highlighting the need for more effective scalable fact-checking tools.

Method: RAVE (Retrieval and Scoring Aware Verifiable Claim Detection) framework that integrates evidence retrieval with structured signals of relevance and source credibility.

Result: Experiments on CT22-test and PoliClaim-test datasets show RAVE consistently outperforms text-only and retrieval-based baselines in both accuracy and F1 scores.

Conclusion: The RAVE framework provides an effective approach for verifiable claim detection by leveraging evidence retrieval combined with relevance and credibility assessment.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on social media underscores the need for
scalable fact-checking tools. A key step is claim detection, which identifies
statements that can be objectively verified. Prior approaches often rely on
linguistic cues or claim check-worthiness, but these struggle with vague
political discourse and diverse formats such as tweets. We present RAVE
(Retrieval and Scoring Aware Verifiable Claim Detection), a framework that

TL;DR: Cross-lingual reward modeling improves multilingual LLM reasoning by leveraging complementary strengths across languages, particularly benefiting English under low sampling budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning abilities vary across languages in multilingual LLMs and whether different languages produce complementary reasoning paths.

Method: Train a reward model to rank generated responses across languages for mathematical reasoning tasks, comparing cross-lingual vs single-language reward modeling.

Result: Cross-lingual reward modeling substantially improves mathematical reasoning performance compared to single-language approaches, benefiting even high-resource languages like English, especially under low sampling budgets.

Conclusion: Leveraging complementary reasoning strengths across diverse languages presents new opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: While the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, it remains unclear how such ability varies across languages in
multilingual LLMs and whether different languages produce reasoning paths that
complement each other. To investigate this question, we train a reward model to
rank generated responses for a given question across languages. Our results
show that our cross-lingual reward model substantially improves mathematical
reasoning performance compared to using reward modeling within a single
language, benefiting even high-resource languages. While English often exhibits
the highest performance in multilingual models, we find that cross-lingual
sampling particularly benefits English under low sampling budgets. Our findings
reveal new opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning by leveraging the
complementary strengths of diverse languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Visual grounding affects language processing differently in speech vs. text models, enhancing word identity alignment but not semantic discriminability in speech models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual information in training affects language processing in audio- and text-based deep learning models, specifically examining how visual grounding influences model-internal representations of words.

Method: Global representational comparisons and targeted clustering analyses to probe phonetic vs. semantic discriminability in model representations of speech- and text-based language encoders.

Result: Visual grounding increases alignment between spoken and written language representations, driven by enhanced word identity encoding rather than meaning. Speech representations remain phonetically dominated, and visual grounding does not improve semantic discriminability in speech models unlike text models.

Conclusion: Findings can inform development of more efficient methods to enrich speech-based models with visually-informed semantics, highlighting different effects of visual grounding on speech vs. text representations.

Abstract: How does visual information included in training affect language processing
in audio- and text-based deep learning models? We explore how such visual
grounding affects model-internal representations of words, and find
substantially different effects in speech- vs. text-based language encoders.
Firstly, global representational comparisons reveal that visual grounding
increases alignment between representations of spoken and written language, but
this effect seems mainly driven by enhanced encoding of word identity rather
than meaning. We then apply targeted clustering analyses to probe for phonetic
vs. semantic discriminability in model representations. Speech-based
representations remain phonetically dominated with visual grounding, but in
contrast to text-based representations, visual grounding does not improve
semantic discriminability. Our findings could usefully inform the development
of more efficient methods to enrich speech-based models with visually-informed
semantics.

Conclusion: Multi-Physics provides a valuable resource and robust methodology for dissecting multimodal reasoning processes of state-of-the-art MLLMs in specialized scientific domains, with open-sourced dataset and code available to the community.

Abstract: While multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning progress,
their application in specialized scientific domains like physics reveals
significant gaps in current evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, existing

Furthermore, we systematically study the impact of difficulty level and visual
information by comparing the model performance before and after changing the
input mode. Our work provides not only a fine-grained resource for the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Steering Vector Decoding (SVD) is a lightweight method that adapts language models by steering output distributions during decoding rather than through weight updates, improving performance across multiple tasks without additional trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning billion-parameter language models is costly even with parameter-efficient methods. The paper aims to reduce adaptation costs by directly aligning output distributions rather than indirectly through weight updates.

Method: SVD extracts a task-aware steering vector from KL divergence gradient between warm-started and pre-trained models, then uses this vector to guide decoding. It's theoretically equivalent to full fine-tuning's gradient step and provides optimal steering strength.

Result: SVD improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 points across three tasks and nine benchmarks, with similar gains on commonsense datasets, without adding trainable parameters beyond PEFT adapters.

Conclusion: SVD offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded approach for stronger task adaptation in large language models, providing performance improvements while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still
costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task
adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the
output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding
rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we
introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and
theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and
extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained
models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to
steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We
theoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of
full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the
steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four
standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and
open-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on
commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT
adapter. SVD thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger
task adaptation for large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey paper argues for a shift from purely factual accuracy-based misinformation detection to human-centered frameworks that incorporate psychological factors like cognitive biases, social dynamics, and emotional responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated fact-checking systems are limited to evaluating factual accuracy, but misinformation's harm extends beyond falsehoods to how people perceive, interpret, and emotionally react to information. There's a need for more holistic detection approaches.

Method: The paper conducts a survey analyzing state-of-the-art misinformation detection systems through the lens of human psychology and behavior, examining the interplay between traditional fact-checking and psychological concepts.

Result: The analysis reveals critical limitations in current misinformation detection methods and identifies opportunities for improvement by incorporating human psychological factors.

Conclusion: Future research should develop neuro-behavioral models that integrate technological factors with human cognition and social influence complexities, creating more robust and adaptive frameworks to effectively detect and mitigate misinformation's societal harms.

Abstract: Misinformation remains one of the most significant issues in the digital age.
While automated fact-checking has emerged as a viable solution, most current
systems are limited to evaluating factual accuracy. However, the detrimental
effect of misinformation transcends simple falsehoods; it takes advantage of
how individuals perceive, interpret, and emotionally react to information. This
underscores the need to move beyond factuality and adopt more human-centered
detection frameworks. In this survey, we explore the evolving interplay between
traditional fact-checking approaches and psychological concepts such as
cognitive biases, social dynamics, and emotional responses. By analyzing
state-of-the-art misinformation detection systems through the lens of human
psychology and behavior, we reveal critical limitations of current methods and
identify opportunities for improvement. Additionally, we outline future
research directions aimed at creating more robust and adaptive frameworks, such
as neuro-behavioural models that integrate technological factors with the
complexities of human cognition and social influence. These approaches offer
promising pathways to more effectively detect and mitigate the societal harms
of misinformation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based meeting summarization suffers from hallucinations, omissions, and irrelevancies, lacking control and personalization capabilities.

Method: FRAME pipeline extracts/scored salient facts, organizes them thematically, enriches outlines into summaries. SCOPE uses reason-out-loud protocol with 9 questions for personalization. P-MESA framework for multi-dimensional evaluation.

Result: FRAME reduces hallucination/omission by 2/5 points on QMSum/FAME datasets. SCOPE improves knowledge fit and goal alignment. P-MESA achieves >=89% balanced accuracy against human annotations with strong correlation (r>=0.70).

Conclusion: Rethinking summarization as semantic enrichment improves control, faithfulness, and personalization in meeting summarization systems.

Abstract: Meeting summarization with large language models (LLMs) remains error-prone,
often producing outputs with hallucinations, omissions, and irrelevancies. We
present FRAME, a modular pipeline that reframes summarization as a semantic
enrichment task. FRAME extracts and scores salient facts, organizes them
thematically, and uses these to enrich an outline into an abstractive summary.
To personalize summaries, we introduce SCOPE, a reason-out-loud protocol that
has the model build a reasoning trace by answering nine questions before
content selection. For evaluation, we propose P-MESA, a multi-dimensional,
reference-free evaluation framework to assess if a summary fits a target
reader. P-MESA reliably identifies error instances, achieving >= 89% balanced
accuracy against human annotations and strongly aligns with human severity
ratings (r >= 0.70). On QMSum and FAME, FRAME reduces hallucination and
omission by 2 out of 5 points (measured with MESA), while SCOPE improves
knowledge fit and goal alignment over prompt-only baselines. Our findings
advocate for rethinking summarization to improve control, faithfulness, and
personalization.

### [46] [Beyond the Score: Uncertainty-Calibrated LLMs for Automated Essay Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15926)
*Ahmed Karim,Qiao Wang,Zheng Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of confidence measures in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems by using conformal prediction to provide set-valued outputs with formal coverage guarantees, applied to fine-tuned open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world adoption of AES systems in high-stakes examinations is limited because most models output single scores without confidence measures or explanations, creating trust and reliability issues.

Method: Fine-tuned two open-source LLMs (Llama-3 8B and Qwen-2.5 3B) on three essay corpora and applied conformal prediction at 90% risk level, assessing reliability with uncertainty-aware accuracy (UAcc).

Result: Calibrated models consistently met the 90% coverage target while maintaining compact prediction sets, demonstrating that mid-sized open-source LLMs can support teacher-in-the-loop AES.

Conclusion: The combination of conformal prediction and UAcc successfully addresses reliability concerns in AES, with future work focusing on scaling and broader user studies.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems now reach near human agreement on some
public benchmarks, yet real-world adoption, especially in high-stakes
examinations, remains limited. A principal obstacle is that most models output
a single score without any accompanying measure of confidence or explanation.
We address this gap with conformal prediction, a distribution-free wrapper that
equips any classifier with set-valued outputs and formal coverage guarantees.
Two open-source large language models (Llama-3 8B and Qwen-2.5 3B) are
fine-tuned on three diverse corpora (ASAP, TOEFL11, Cambridge-FCE) and
calibrated at a 90 percent risk level. Reliability is assessed with UAcc, an
uncertainty-aware accuracy that rewards models for being both correct and
concise. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine conformal
prediction and UAcc for essay scoring. The calibrated models consistently meet
the coverage target while keeping prediction sets compact, indicating that
open-source, mid-sized LLMs can already support teacher-in-the-loop AES; we
discuss scaling and broader user studies as future work.

### [47] [Localmax dynamics for attention in transformers and its asymptotic behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15958)
*Henri Cimeti√®re,Maria Teresa Chiri,Bahman Gharesifard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces localmax dynamics, a discrete-time attention model that interpolates between softmax and hardmax dynamics, featuring controlled relaxation of neighborhood interactions through an alignment-sensitivity parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more flexible attention mechanism that bridges the gap between softmax (smooth) and hardmax (strict winner-take-all) dynamics, allowing controlled deviations from pure hardmax behavior while maintaining analytical tractability.

Method: The authors propose localmax dynamics with two key parameters: one controlling neighbor influence (similar to hardmax) and an alignment-sensitivity parameter that relaxes neighborhood interactions. They analyze convergence properties, introduce quiescent sets to capture invariant behavior, and adapt Lyapunov-based methods from opinion dynamics.

Result: The model converges to a convex polytope but cannot be fully described by maximal alignment sets alone, requiring quiescent sets. It does not exhibit finite-time convergence, and the authors provide results for various alignment-sensitivity parameter regimes, recovering hardmax behavior as a limiting case.

Conclusion: Localmax dynamics offers a flexible framework between softmax and hardmax, with quiescent sets being crucial for understanding asymptotic behavior. The paper highlights limitations of classical Lyapunov methods in asymmetric settings and outlines future research directions.

Abstract: We introduce a new discrete-time attention model, termed the localmax
dynamics, which interpolates between the classic softmax dynamics and the
hardmax dynamics, where only the tokens that maximize the influence toward a
given token have a positive weight. As in hardmax, uniform weights are
determined by a parameter controlling neighbor influence, but the key extension
lies in relaxing neighborhood interactions through an alignment-sensitivity
parameter, which allows controlled deviations from pure hardmax behavior. As we
prove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex
polytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment
set, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant
behavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in
understanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying
alignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does
not exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero,
time-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior
of hardmax as a by-product. Finally, we adapt Lyapunov-based methods from
classical opinion dynamics, highlighting their limitations in the asymmetric
setting of localmax interactions and outlining directions for future research.

*Baichuan Huang,Ananth Balashankar,Amir Aminifar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bias-efficient fine-tuning (BEFT) approach for selecting which bias terms to fine-tune in large language models, demonstrating superior performance across various tasks and model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias-only fine-tuning offers parameter efficiency but lacks clear guidance on selecting which specific bias terms (query, key, or value projections) to fine-tune for optimal downstream performance.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach for selecting bias terms to fine-tune, comparing it against existing methods like magnitude of bias change and empirical Fisher information across LLMs from 110M to 6.7B parameters.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows the proposed bias-efficient approach outperforms other bias-selection methods on diverse tasks including classification, multiple-choice, and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The bias-efficient fine-tuning (BEFT) approach provides an effective and superior method for selecting bias terms to fine-tune, enabling unprecedented parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning all-bias-terms stands out among various parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, owing to its out-of-the-box usability and
competitive performance, especially in low-data regimes. Bias-only fine-tuning
has the potential for unprecedented parameter efficiency. However, the link
between fine-tuning different bias terms (i.e., bias terms in the query, key,
or value projections) and downstream performance remains unclear. The existing
approaches, e.g., based on the magnitude of bias change or empirical Fisher
information, provide limited guidance for selecting the particular bias term
for effective fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose an approach for selecting
the bias term to be fine-tuned, forming the foundation of our bias-efficient
fine-tuning (BEFT). We extensively evaluate our bias-efficient approach against
other bias-selection approaches, across a wide range of large language models
(LLMs) spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures from 110M to 6.7B
parameters. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
bias-efficient approach on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
multiple-choice, and generation tasks.

*Hong-Yun Lin,Jhen-Ke Lin,Chung-Chun Wang,Hao-Chien Lu,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel multimodal foundation model for spoken language assessment that performs session-level evaluation in a single pass, outperforming previous cascaded systems and showing robust cross-part generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing population of L2 English speakers has intensified demand for reliable spoken language assessment. Existing approaches use error-prone cascaded pipelines or end-to-end models that miss discourse-level evidence by operating on short audio windows.

Method: Uses multi-target learning with a frozen Whisper ASR model-based speech prior for acoustic-aware calibration, allowing joint learning of holistic and trait-level objectives without handcrafted features. Processes entire response sessions coherently.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art cascaded system on the Speak & Improve benchmark. Exhibits robust cross-part generalization and produces a compact deployable grader for CALL applications.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal foundation model approach effectively addresses limitations of existing SLA methods by enabling session-level evaluation with improved performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Spoken Language Assessment (SLA) estimates a learner's oral proficiency from
spontaneous speech. The growing population of L2 English speakers has
intensified the demand for reliable SLA, a critical component of Computer
Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Existing efforts often rely on cascaded
pipelines, which are prone to error propagation, or end-to-end models that
often operate on a short audio window, which might miss discourse-level
evidence. This paper introduces a novel multimodal foundation model approach
that performs session-level evaluation in a single pass. Our approach couples
multi-target learning with a frozen, Whisper ASR model-based speech prior for
acoustic-aware calibration, allowing for jointly learning holistic and
trait-level objectives of SLA without resorting to handcrafted features. By
coherently processing the entire response session of an L2 speaker, the model
excels at predicting holistic oral proficiency. Experiments conducted on the
Speak & Improve benchmark demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art cascaded system and exhibits robust cross-part
generalization, producing a compact deployable grader that is tailored for CALL
applications.

*Sang Hoon Woo,Sehun Lee,Kang-wook Kim,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Think-Verbalize-Speak (TVS) framework decouples reasoning from speech delivery using verbalization to preserve LLM reasoning while improving spoken output naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of LLMs in spoken dialogue systems yields suboptimal results due to mismatches between optimal textual and verbal delivery, with existing approaches' impact on reasoning performance being underexplored.

Method: Proposes TVS framework with verbalization as intermediate step to translate thoughts into speech-ready text, and introduces ReVerT - a latency-efficient verbalizer using incremental and asynchronous summarization.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show enhanced speech naturalness and conciseness with minimal impact on reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully preserves LLM reasoning capacity while improving spoken dialogue system performance through decoupled reasoning and verbalization.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) to
leverage their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, direct application of
LLMs in spoken communication often yield suboptimal results due to mismatches
between optimal textual and verbal delivery. While existing approaches adapt
LLMs to produce speech-friendly outputs, their impact on reasoning performance
remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Think-Verbalize-Speak, a
framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full
reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is verbalizing, an
intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text. We
also introduce ReVerT, a latency-efficient verbalizer based on incremental and
asynchronous summarization. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that
our method enhances speech naturalness and conciseness with minimal impact on
reasoning. The project page with the dataset and the source code is available

*Fangyi Yu,Nabeel Seedat,Dasha Herrmannova,Frank Schilder,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeCE is a decomposed LLM evaluation framework that separates precision (factual accuracy) and recall (coverage) using automatically extracted criteria from gold answers, achieving strong correlation with expert judgments in legal QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture semantic correctness in high-stakes domains, and current LLM evaluators reduce nuanced quality aspects into single scores.

Method: DeCE framework separates precision and recall evaluation using instance-specific criteria automatically extracted from gold answer requirements, requiring no predefined taxonomies or handcrafted rubrics.

Result: DeCE achieves substantially stronger correlation with expert judgments (r=0.78) compared to traditional metrics (r=0.12), pointwise LLM scoring (r=0.35), and modern multidimensional evaluators (r=0.48). It reveals interpretable trade-offs between generalist and specialized models.

Conclusion: DeCE offers an interpretable and actionable LLM evaluation framework in expert domains, with high scalability (only 11.95% of criteria required expert revision).

Abstract: Evaluating long-form answers in high-stakes domains such as law or medicine
remains a fundamental challenge. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to
capture semantic correctness, and current LLM-based evaluators often reduce
nuanced aspects of answer quality into a single undifferentiated score. We
introduce DeCE, a decomposed LLM evaluation framework that separates precision
(factual accuracy and relevance) and recall (coverage of required concepts),
using instance-specific criteria automatically extracted from gold answer
requirements. DeCE is model-agnostic and domain-general, requiring no
predefined taxonomies or handcrafted rubrics. We instantiate DeCE to evaluate
different LLMs on a real-world legal QA task involving multi-jurisdictional
reasoning and citation grounding. DeCE achieves substantially stronger
correlation with expert judgments ($r=0.78$), compared to traditional metrics
($r=0.12$), pointwise LLM scoring ($r=0.35$), and modern multidimensional
evaluators ($r=0.48$). It also reveals interpretable trade-offs: generalist
models favor recall, while specialized models favor precision. Importantly,
only 11.95% of LLM-generated criteria required expert revision, underscoring
DeCE's scalability. DeCE offers an interpretable and actionable LLM evaluation
framework in expert domains.

*Sikai Bai,Haoxi Li,Jie Zhang,Zicong Hong,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiEP is a non-uniform pruning strategy for Mixture-of-Experts models that adaptively adjusts pruning rates at layer level to handle varying expert redundancy, achieving 92% performance retention with half the experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE pruning methods use uniform sparsity across layers, leading to suboptimal outcomes due to varying expert redundancy in different MoE layers, which causes performance degradation.

Method: DiEP transforms the global discrete search space into a continuous one, adaptively adjusts pruning rates at layer level while jointly learning inter-layer importance, enabling adaptive gradient-based pruning to handle exponentially growing non-uniform expert combinations.

Result: Extensive experiments on five advanced MoE models show DiEP retains around 92% of original performance on Mixtral 8√ó7B with only half the experts, outperforming other pruning methods by up to 7.1% on MMLU dataset.

Conclusion: DiEP effectively addresses memory and storage challenges in large MoE models through non-uniform pruning that captures varying redundancy across different MoE layers, demonstrating superior performance compared to uniform pruning approaches.

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthrough of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), the
increasing scale of these MoE models presents huge memory and storage
challenges. Existing MoE pruning methods, which involve reducing parameter size
with a uniform sparsity across all layers, often lead to suboptimal outcomes
and performance degradation due to varying expert redundancy in different MoE
layers. To address this, we propose a non-uniform pruning strategy, dubbed
\textbf{Di}fferentiable \textbf{E}xpert \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{DiEP}), which
adaptively adjusts pruning rates at the layer level while jointly learning
inter-layer importance, effectively capturing the varying redundancy across
different MoE layers. By transforming the global discrete search space into a
continuous one, our method handles exponentially growing non-uniform expert
combinations, enabling adaptive gradient-based pruning. Extensive experiments
on five advanced MoE models demonstrate the efficacy of our method across
various NLP tasks. Notably, \textbf{DiEP} retains around 92\% of original
performance on Mixtral 8$\times$7B with only half the experts, outperforming
other pruning methods by up to 7.1\% on the challenging MMLU dataset.

*Lukas Ellinger,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with referential ambiguity resolution in conversations, tending to commit to single interpretations or cover all possibilities rather than hedging. Simplification prompts worsen this issue, but fine-tuning with DPO significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can leverage commonsense knowledge to resolve referential ambiguity in multi-turn conversations, and analyze how simplification requests affect this capability.

Method: Used a novel multilingual evaluation dataset to test multiple LLMs (DeepSeek v3, GPT-4o, Qwen3-32B, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.1-8B) via LLM-as-Judge and human annotations. Applied Direct Preference Optimization fine-tuning to Llama-3.1-8B.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with ambiguity resolution, either committing to single interpretations or covering all references. Simplification prompts reduce commonsense reasoning and diverse strategies. DPO fine-tuning substantially improves ambiguity resolution across request types.

Conclusion: Advanced fine-tuning is needed to improve LLMs' handling of ambiguity and ensure robust performance across diverse communication styles.

Abstract: Ambiguous words or underspecified references require interlocutors to resolve
them, often by relying on shared context and commonsense knowledge. Therefore,
we systematically investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can leverage
commonsense to resolve referential ambiguity in multi-turn conversations and
analyze their behavior when ambiguity persists. Further, we study how requests
for simplified language affect this capacity. Using a novel multilingual
evaluation dataset, we test DeepSeek v3, GPT-4o, Qwen3-32B, GPT-4o-mini, and
Llama-3.1-8B via LLM-as-Judge and human annotations. Our findings indicate that
current LLMs struggle to resolve ambiguity effectively: they tend to commit to
a single interpretation or cover all possible references, rather than hedging
or seeking clarification. This limitation becomes more pronounced under
simplification prompts, which drastically reduce the use of commonsense
reasoning and diverse response strategies. Fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B with Direct
Preference Optimization substantially improves ambiguity resolution across all
request types. These results underscore the need for advanced fine-tuning to
improve LLMs' handling of ambiguity and to ensure robust performance across
diverse communication styles.

TL;DR: CodeRAG is a framework for repository-level code completion that addresses issues in existing methods through improved query construction, multi-path retrieval, and preference-aligned reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current repository-level code completion methods suffer from inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLMs.

Method: CodeRAG uses log probability guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned BestFit reranking to identify relevant knowledge for retrieval-augmented code completion.

Result: Extensive experiments on ReccEval and CCEval benchmarks show CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CodeRAG provides an effective framework for repository-level code completion by addressing key limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: Repository-level code completion automatically predicts the unfinished code
based on the broader information from the repository. Recent strides in Code
Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of
repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results.
Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction,
single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code
LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to
identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented
repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability
guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned
BestFit reranking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks ReccEval and CCEval
demonstrate that CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensiveness and scalability across cultural contexts due to reliance on expert-driven manual annotations without guidance from established cultural theories.

Method: Proposed CultureScope framework with dimensional schema inspired by cultural iceberg theory (3 layers, 140 dimensions) to automate construction of culture-specific knowledge bases and evaluation datasets for any languages/cultures.

Result: Experimental results show the method effectively evaluates cultural understanding and reveal that existing LLMs lack comprehensive cultural competence, with multilingual data alone not enhancing cultural understanding.

Conclusion: CultureScope provides the most comprehensive evaluation framework to date for assessing cultural understanding in LLMs, addressing scalability and adaptability challenges across diverse cultural environments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural
environments, evaluating their cultural understanding capability has become
essential for ensuring trustworthy and culturally aligned applications.
However, most existing benchmarks lack comprehensiveness and are challenging to
scale and adapt across different cultural contexts, because their frameworks
often lack guidance from well-established cultural theories and tend to rely on
expert-driven manual annotations. To address these issues, we propose
CultureScope, the most comprehensive evaluation framework to date for assessing
cultural understanding in LLMs. Inspired by the cultural iceberg theory, we
design a novel dimensional schema for cultural knowledge classification,
comprising 3 layers and 140 dimensions, which guides the automated construction
of culture-specific knowledge bases and corresponding evaluation datasets for
any given languages and cultures. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method can effectively evaluate cultural understanding. They also reveal that
existing large language models lack comprehensive cultural competence, and
merely incorporating multilingual data does not necessarily enhance cultural
understanding. All code and data files are available at

TL;DR: ZeroRepo introduces Repository Planning Graph (RPG) to address the challenge of generating complete software repositories from scratch, replacing ambiguous natural language with explicit blueprints for coherent planning and scalable code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language is ill-suited for representing complex software structures due to ambiguity and verbosity, making complete repository generation a fundamental challenge despite LLMs' capabilities in function- and file-level code generation.

Method: ZeroRepo uses a three-stage graph-driven framework: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation.

Result: On the RepoCraft benchmark (6 real-world projects, 1,052 tasks), ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC (3.9√ó stronger baseline), achieving 81.5% functional coverage and 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points respectively.

Conclusion: RPG effectively models complex dependencies, enables sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, accelerating agent localization for repository generation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet
generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge.
This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and
implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and
verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software
structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG),
a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level
planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions
in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit
blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation.
Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository
generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning
and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by
graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we
construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks.
On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly
3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other
baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate,
exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further
analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more
sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM
understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM2VEC4CXR and LLM2CLIP4CXR are domain-adapted models that use LLM encoders to improve chest X-ray report understanding and image-text alignment, addressing challenges of noisy clinical reports through robustness rather than just scaling data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology vision-language pretraining is constrained by heterogeneous clinical reports with abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability. Naively scaling to large noisy datasets can plateau or degrade performance, so robust clinical representations are needed.

Method: Introduces LLM2VEC4CXR (domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports) and LLM2CLIP4CXR (dual-tower framework coupling the LLM encoder with vision backbone). Trained on 1.6M CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous reports.

Result: LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines, handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical alignment. LLM2CLIP4CXR boosts retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants.

Conclusion: Robustness - not scale alone - is key to effective multimodal learning in medical imaging. Models demonstrate that LLM encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across diverse report styles and better guide image-text alignment.

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec introduces a novel speculative decoding framework for vision-language models that achieves substantial speedups by using a lightweight vision adaptor to compress image tokens and enhance multimodal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding has been successful for LLMs but achieves only modest speedups (<1.5x) for VLMs, creating a significant gap as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models.

Method: ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into compact representations, integrates them into the draft model's attention mechanism, and augments text tokens with global image features. It also curates specialized training data to prevent shortcut learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show ViSpec achieves the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ViSpec successfully addresses the challenges of applying speculative decoding to VLMs and demonstrates that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information without compromising textual comprehension.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [59] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE is a multimodal compliance framework that uses a mother-child MLLM setup to unify compliance checking for vision-language content, reducing costs by 31x while maintaining comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance frameworks use disjointed multi-stage pipelines that increase operational overhead and hinder scalability. MLLMs offer potential to unify these workflows under a single framework.

Method: Proposes M-PACE framework using mother-child MLLM setup where a stronger parent MLLM evaluates outputs of smaller child models. Applied to advertisement compliance with human-annotated benchmark including challenging real-world conditions.

Result: Reduces inference costs by over 31 times (from $0.0159 to $0.0005 per image) with comparable accuracy. Can evaluate over 15 compliance-related attributes in a single pass.

Conclusion: M-PACE demonstrates effective automation of quality control, significantly reducing human reviewer dependence while achieving cost-quality trade-offs suitable for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion is a hybrid framework that combines deep learning with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to predict 3D structures of large protein complexes, overcoming limitations of current AI methods and expensive experimental techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI methods struggle with large protein complexes due to missing 3D spatial cues, while experimental techniques like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. AFM provides high-resolution height maps but generating sufficient training data is impractical.

Method: Developed a virtual AFM framework to simulate imaging and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins with multi-view synthetic AFM images. Uses conditional diffusion model for novel view synthesis and instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction.

Result: Reconstructed 3D protein structures achieve average Chamfer Distance within AFM imaging resolution, demonstrating high structural fidelity. Validated on experimental AFM images of various protein complexes.

Conclusion: ProFusion shows strong potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and enables rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MMEL, a Multi-Modal Explainable Learning framework that enhances interpretability of vision-language models through hierarchical semantic relationship processing while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying vision-language models in safety-critical contexts is challenging due to complex object relationships, subtle visual cues, and demands for transparency and reliability.

Method: MMEL builds on Grad-eclip and introduces a Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module with multi-scale feature processing, adaptive attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment to capture relationships at different granularities.

Result: MMEL produces more focused and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language models process complex scenes, generalizing across various domains.

Conclusion: The framework offers valuable insights into model decisions for applications requiring high interpretability and reliability, enhancing both transparency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [62] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP) is a token pruning method for Vision-and-Language Navigation that preserves navigation performance while reducing computational cost by over 50% FLOPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models achieve strong VLN performance but are computationally expensive. Token pruning can improve efficiency but prior methods overlook VLN-specific challenges like information loss leading to longer navigation paths.

Method: NAP uses navigation-specific traits to pre-filter tokens into foreground/background categories. It filters image views based on navigable directions and extracts navigation-relevant instructions using LLMs, then focuses pruning on background tokens while discouraging backtracking by removing low-importance nodes.

Result: Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

Conclusion: Navigation-aware pruning effectively balances efficiency and performance in VLN tasks by leveraging domain-specific knowledge to minimize information loss during token reduction.

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff is a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that uses dual-module transformation on diffusion model representations to improve fairness and safety without compromising semantic fidelity or image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving fairness and safety in text-to-image generation typically sacrifice semantic fidelity and image quality, creating a need for a balanced approach that maintains both responsible generation and high-quality output.

Method: The approach introduces two learnable modules: one for enforcing responsible concepts (fairness/safety) and another for maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts, using a novel score-matching objective for coordination between modules.

Result: RespoDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse prompts, and integrates seamlessly with large-scale models like SDXL.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the trade-off between responsible generation and image quality, providing an effective solution for fairness and safety in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether autoguidance and online data selection methods (specifically JEST) can improve time and sample efficiency in training generative diffusion models, finding that autoguidance consistently improves quality while early data selection shows limited benefits due to overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of generative models by exploring efficient data curation methods that could improve training efficiency for diffusion models.

Method: Integrated joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified codebase for benchmarking. Evaluated combinations on 2-D synthetic data and 3x64x64-D image generation tasks, comparing at equal wall-clock time and sample counts while accounting for selection overhead.

Result: Autoguidance consistently improved sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (selection only at training start) could match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency, but its time overhead and complexity made autoguidance or uniform random selection preferable in most cases.

Conclusion: Targeted online selection can yield early training efficiency gains, but robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. Data selection may be beneficial in specific scenarios despite limitations.

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a scalable framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images using phase-enhanced radial Fourier transforms to achieve model attribution with high accuracy across diverse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical need for attribution methods to identify the source model of AI-generated content, especially in commercial settings where users expect guarantees about content origin.

Method: PRISM uses radial reduction of discrete Fourier transform leveraging amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures, followed by linear discriminant analysis clustering for reliable attribution.

Result: Achieved 92.04% attribution accuracy on PRISM-36K dataset, 81.60% average accuracy on four benchmarks, and 88.41% accuracy for real vs fake detection, with best result of 95.06% on GenImage benchmark.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain fingerprinting is effective for cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, providing a viable solution for accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of vision transformers (ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, DINOv3) on mental rotation tasks, finding self-supervised models outperform supervised ones and intermediate layers work best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well modern vision transformers develop spatial reasoning abilities similar to human mental rotation, which is a key test of spatial cognition.

Method: Probing model representations layer by layer across various mental-rotation tasks including block structures, text, and photo-realistic objects with different rotation complexities and occlusion levels.

Result: Self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; intermediate layers perform better than final layers; task difficulty increases with rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times.

Conclusion: Vision transformers exhibit mental rotation abilities with patterns similar to human cognition, suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered Vision Transformer (ViT) features from self-supervised learning, evaluating different token types and decision rules for image classification and segmentation tasks without additional transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL approaches for ViTs often use additional transformation layers or distillation to achieve superior performance, but there's no comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic capabilities of unmodified ViT features. The study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Systematically evaluates unmodified ViT features (keys, queries, values, and post-feed-forward features) across image classification and segmentation tasks using hyperplane-based (logistic regression) and cosine-similarity based decision rules, without additional feature transformations.

Result: The analysis provides insights into optimal token type and decision rule choices based on task, context, and pre-training objective, with detailed findings reported on two widely-used datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that unaltered ViT features have significant intrinsic representation capabilities, and provides guidance on selecting appropriate token types and decision rules for different computer vision tasks without requiring additional transformations.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark to evaluate large multimodal models' reasoning capabilities in embodied environments, highlighting current limitations and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large multimodal models show promising visual understanding but lack structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks that require safety, spatial coherence, and contextual grounding.

Method: Proposed FoMER benchmark with 1.1k samples across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments covering 3 robot types, featuring a novel evaluation framework that separates perceptual grounding from action reasoning.

Result: Empirical analysis reveals both potential and significant limitations of leading LMMs in embodied reasoning, identifying key challenges for future development.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a foundation for advancing robot intelligence by systematically evaluating and improving embodied reasoning capabilities in foundation models.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoDoL, a Conditional Domain prompt Learning method that uses domain information to improve vision-language embedding alignment and out-of-distribution generalization in CLIP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP methods suffer from inaccurate text descriptions and limited vision-language embedding alignment, which affects zero-shot performance and generalization to out-of-distribution data.

Method: CoDoL utilizes domain information to form prompts and includes a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional tokens capturing both instance-specific and domain-specific information.

Result: Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DigitDG) show improved vision-language embedding alignment and better out-of-distribution generalization performance.

Conclusion: The proposed CoDoL method effectively addresses the limitations of existing CLIP approaches by leveraging domain information for better prompt learning and embedding alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN is a framework that shifts machine vision from passive processing to active, adaptive perception by mimicking human visual attention through sequential fixations, achieving significant efficiency gains without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine vision models process entire scenes at once, leading to excessive computational demands that scale with input resolution and model size, limiting advancements and real-world applications.

Method: Formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process using self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training without supervision on fixation locations.

Result: Achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without accuracy loss, adapts to varying task demands without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability through fixation patterns.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a promising approach for efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision that closely mimics human perceptual behaviors, potentially serving as a tool for visual cognition research.

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

TL;DR: LowDiff is an efficient diffusion framework that uses cascaded generation from low to high resolution with a unified model, achieving comparable or better quality with 50%+ throughput improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have slow sampling speed, and prior efficiency improvements focused on model compression or reducing denoising steps, neglecting multi-resolution generation approaches.

Method: Proposes LowDiff framework using cascaded approach with unified model to progressively refine images from low to high resolution, applicable to both pixel and latent space diffusion models.

Result: Achieved over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets while maintaining comparable or better quality. On CIFAR-10: FID 2.11/IS 9.87 (unconditional), FID 1.94/IS 10.03 (conditional). On FFHQ 64x64: FID 2.43. On ImageNet 256x256: FID 4.00/IS 195.06.

Conclusion: LowDiff demonstrates effectiveness and generality across various datasets and settings, showing substantial efficiency gains while maintaining high-quality generation performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional

*Yu Chang,Jiahao Chen,Anzhe Cheng,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskAttn-SDXL is a region-level gating mechanism for SDXL that sparsifies cross-attention to address compositional failures in multi-object text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models suffer from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations, leading to cross-token interference where entities entangle and spatial cues are violated.

Method: Proposes MaskAttn-SDXL which learns binary masks per layer and injects them into cross-attention logits before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions, preserving only semantically relevant connections without positional encodings or external masks.

Result: The model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: Logit-level masked cross-attention is a data-efficient primitive for enforcing compositional control, making MaskAttn-SDXL a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

### [73] [RaceGAN: A Framework for Preserving Individuality while Converting Racial Information for Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15391)
*Mst Tasnim Pervin,George Bebis,Fang Jiang,Alireza Tavakkoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaceGAN is a novel framework for multi-domain racial attribute translation that maintains individuality and high-level semantics without requiring reference images, outperforming existing models on racial feature translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN models like CycleGAN, StarGAN, and StyleGAN have limitations in handling multi-domain racial attribute translation - they either require reference images, don't maintain individuality, or can't map in-depth low-level style changes across domains.

Method: RaceGAN uses a novel framework that maps style codes over multiple domains during racial attribute translation while preserving individuality and high-level semantics without relying on reference images.

Result: RaceGAN outperforms other models in translating racial features (Asian, White, Black) on the Chicago Face Dataset, with quantitative validation using InceptionReNetv2-based classification. The model effectively partitions the latent space into distinct clusters for each ethnic group.

Conclusion: RaceGAN successfully addresses the limitations of previous GAN models by enabling multi-domain racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and not requiring reference images, demonstrating superior performance in racial feature translation.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

*Kunal Rathore,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to generate global symbolic explanations by transferring user-defined part labels from limited images to larger datasets, reducing annotation costs while providing human-understandable model explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are opaque, and existing explanation methods either focus on localized visual explanations or require extensive annotations for concept-based explanations, which incur significant labeling costs.

Method: Leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently transfers them to a larger dataset, then aggregates part-based local explanations to generate global symbolic explanations.

Result: Enables generation of human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large scale without requiring extensive annotations.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient way to create global symbolic explanations that help understand model decisions while minimizing labeling costs.

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

*Hui Xu,Chi Liu,Congcong Zhu,Minghao Wang,Youyang Qu,Longxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal fingerprint framework for generative models that disentangles model-specific traces from image content and style using diffusion reconstruction residuals, achieving superior model attribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model fingerprint methods rely on limited cues or artifacts that generalize poorly across different generative models. The authors argue that a complete fingerprint should reflect the causality between image provenance and model traces, which has been largely unexplored.

Method: Proposes a causality-decoupling framework that disentangles causal fingerprints from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residuals. Enhances fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution across representative GANs and diffusion models. Validates causality through attribution performance and source anonymization using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints.

Conclusion: The causal fingerprint framework shows strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection, demonstrating the importance of capturing causal relationships in model attribution.

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

*Moinak Bhattacharya,Angelica P. Kurtz,Fabio M. Iwamoto,Prateek Prasanna,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a neuro-oncology specific foundation model with distributionally robust optimization to improve molecular marker prediction and survival analysis across multiple institutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuro-oncology faces challenges with heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting foundation models' generalization. Existing models perform poorly on uncommon molecular markers essential for treatment response and risk stratification.

Method: Pretrained self-supervised backbones (BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class imbalance. Tasks included molecular classification of common/uncommon markers and survival prediction.

Result: Improved molecular prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. Mean balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785, AUC from 0.656 to 0.676. Largest gains for underrepresented endpoints. Survival c-index improved at all sites. Grad-CAM confirmed interpretability.

Conclusion: Coupling foundation models with DRO yields more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon markers, and enhances survival discrimination, advancing precision neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

*Chung-En Johnny Yu,Hsuan-Chih,Chen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORCA is an agentic reasoning framework that improves factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through test-time structured inference using small vision models without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucinations from intrinsic errors and vulnerability to adversarial attacks, limiting their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: ORCA uses an Observe-Reason-Critique-Act loop with small vision models (<3B parameters) to query visual tools, validate inconsistencies, and refine predictions iteratively while storing reasoning traces for auditable decision-making.

Result: ORCA improves LVLM performance by +3.64% to +40.67% on POPE hallucination benchmark, achieves +20.11% accuracy gain under adversarial perturbations, and provides +1.20% to +48.00% gains when combined with defense techniques on AMBER images.

Conclusion: ORCA offers a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems by enhancing factual accuracy and adversarial robustness without requiring model retraining or access to internals.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

*Abolfazl Saheban Maleki,Maryam Imani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAD-Conv is a new convolutional operator that uses boundary offsets to create flexible rectangular sampling regions, enabling precise control over receptive field shape independent of kernel size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deformable convolutions are limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, which restricts their ability to adapt to complex image structures and capture both local details and long-range dependencies efficiently.

Method: RAD-Conv uses four boundary offsets per kernel element to create flexible rectangular regions that dynamically adjust size and shape. This decouples receptive field shape from kernel structure, allowing even 1x1 kernels to capture wide dependencies.

Result: The approach combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the efficiency of standard convolutions, enabling more expressive and efficient vision models.

Conclusion: RAD-Conv bridges the gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally expensive attention-based methods, offering a practical solution for building adaptive vision models.

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

TL;DR: CAGE is a robust framework for reconstructing vector floorplans from point-cloud density maps using a native edge-centric formulation that models wall segments as directed, geometrically continuous edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional corner-based polygon representations are sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, leading to fragmented layouts. Recent line grouping methods struggle to recover fine geometric details.

Method: Proposes an edge-centric formulation with directed, geometrically continuous edges. Uses a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework for stable optimization and faster convergence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Structured3D and SceneCAD with F1 scores of 99.1% (rooms), 91.7% (corners), and 89.3% (angles). Demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: CAGE provides a robust solution for floorplan reconstruction that ensures watertight, topologically valid room boundaries while reducing artifacts, with effective architectural innovations.

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of labeled data and overfitting in multimodal pulmonary nodule diagnosis models by leveraging unlabeled multimodal medical archives.

Method: Use self-supervised learning with joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) pretraining on unlabeled CT scans and electronic health records, followed by supervised finetuning.

Result: Outperforms baseline models internally (0.91 vs 0.88 multimodal and 0.73 imaging-only AUC) but underperforms externally (0.72 vs 0.75 imaging-only AUC). Developed synthetic environment to characterize failure contexts.

Conclusion: The approach innovatively leverages unlabeled multimodal archives to improve predictive models but has limitations in external generalization, with identified contexts where JEPA may underperform.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

TL;DR: EDGE is a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation that addresses correlation and diversity challenges in image-text datasets, achieving 18x faster performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases computing resource requirements and takes days to process distillation. There's a growing importance of multimodal datasets with the rise of large language models.

Method: Proposes a generative model training workflow with bi-directional contrastive loss and diversity loss to address lack of correlation between generated images/captions and lack of diversity. Also introduces caption synthesis strategy to improve text-to-image retrieval.

Result: Evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Achieves results 18x faster than state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: EDGE provides an efficient solution for multimodal dataset distillation that overcomes key challenges in generative approaches while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing video generation systems which use large models requiring significant resources, offer limited design insights, and lack publicly available code and datasets.

Method: Builds on pre-trained open-source models fine-tuned with publicly available automotive data (BDD100K), with separate evaluation of three components: image tokenizer, world model, and video decoder.

Result: Able to predict realistic driving scene videos at 256x256 resolution and 4 fps with only one frame of algorithmic latency.

Conclusion: OpenViGA provides a transparent, reproducible, and accessible video generation system for automotive scenes by leveraging open-source models and public datasets.

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

TL;DR: Analysis of representational spaces in six computational pathology foundation models reveals distinct structures based on training paradigms, with vision-language models having more compact representations and stain normalization reducing slide-dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and compare the learned representations of computational pathology foundation models, as understanding their representational structures is crucial for improving robustness and informing deployment strategies.

Method: Used representational similarity analysis on H&E image patches from TCGA to compare six CPath foundation models (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP, UNI2, Virchow2, Prov-GigaPath) spanning vision-language contrastive learning and self-distillation approaches.

Result: UNI2 and Virchow2 had the most distinct representations; Prov-GigaPath showed highest average similarity; same training paradigm didn't guarantee similarity; all models showed high slide-dependence but low disease-dependence; stain normalization reduced slide-dependence by 5.5-20.5%; vision-language models had more compact representations than vision-only models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape representations, with the framework being extendable across medical imaging domains.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

Motivation: Current vision-language models are too large for resource-constrained environments like warehouses and robotics, where both efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical.

Method: A compact architecture with region-level spatial reasoning using RGB and depth cues, employing a three-stage curriculum for progressive visual-language alignment, spatial relationship understanding, and task-specific adaptation.

Result: With only 600M parameters, SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger alternatives.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential for efficient, deployable multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth

to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger

ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for
conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen
reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers
through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity
preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through
evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which
yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the
state of personalized video generation.

### [86] [Backdoor Mitigation via Invertible Pruning Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15497)
*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pruning approach with learned selection mechanism and invertible mask for backdoor defense, formulated as bi-level optimization to eliminate backdoors while preserving clean task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning-based defenses fall short in accurately identifying backdoor parameters, while fine-tuning dominates but pruning offers better interpretability and robustness in low-data regimes.

Method: Learned selection mechanism to identify critical parameters, invertible pruning mask for simultaneous backdoor elimination and preservation, bi-level optimization with inner problem for trigger synthesis and outer problem for mask refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing pruning-based approaches, maintains strong performance under limited data, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, particularly effective in restoring correct predictions for compromised samples.

Conclusion: The proposed invertible pruning approach provides an effective defense against backdoor attacks with superior performance, interpretability, and robustness in data-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

*Junbiao Pang,Tianyang Cai,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEC-Quant is a novel quantization-aware training method that addresses representation biases in low-bit quantization by optimizing representation structure using maximum entropy principles, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to full-precision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT methods still produce inferior performance compared to full-precision models, especially in extremely low-bit settings, due to quantization introducing biases into learned representations.

Method: Proposes Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant) that uses minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a surrogate for entropy, with a scalable Mixture of Experts (MOE) reformulation for efficient computation and handling long-tailed distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments show MEC-Quant pushes QAT limits to x-bit activation for the first time, achieving accuracy comparable to or surpassing full-precision counterparts, establishing new state-of-the-art for QAT.

Conclusion: MEC-Quant provides a principled approach to reduce representation biases in quantization, enabling high-performance low-bit neural networks that match or exceed full-precision performance.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

TL;DR: GUI-ARP is a novel framework for GUI grounding that uses adaptive multi-stage inference with adaptive region perception and stage controlling to improve fine-grained localization in high-resolution screenshots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding methods struggle with fine-grained localization in high-resolution screenshots, requiring a more adaptive approach to handle varying complexity levels.

Method: Proposes GUI-ARP framework with Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) for task-relevant region cropping and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC) for dynamic inference strategy (single-stage for simple cases, multi-stage for complex scenarios). Uses two-phase training with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9% on UI-Vision benchmark with 7B model. GUI-ARP-7B outperforms open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and shows strong competitiveness against proprietary models.

Conclusion: GUI-ARP demonstrates effective adaptive multi-stage inference for GUI grounding, achieving superior performance with smaller models by dynamically adjusting inference strategy based on complexity.

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMPO is a hybrid world model framework that combines visual autoregressive modeling with causal modeling to improve video prediction and planning, achieving 4.4x faster inference while maintaining high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and inadequate motion modeling, limiting their effectiveness for planning and control tasks.

Method: SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with bidirectional spatial attention, uses an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer, and includes a trajectory-aware motion prompt module to preserve spatial details and improve dynamic scene understanding.

Result: SAMPO achieves competitive performance in action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, with 4.4x faster inference speed while maintaining generation quality. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed SAMPO framework effectively addresses limitations of existing world models by combining autoregressive and causal modeling approaches, resulting in improved temporal consistency, efficiency, and physical realism for planning and control applications.

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

*Wei Chen,Tongguan Wang,Feiyue Xue,Junkai Li,Hui Liu,Ying Sha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A symmetrical bidirectional multimodal learning framework that uses mutual guidance between text and image modalities to improve desire, emotion, and sentiment recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches for sentiment analysis overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues, and there's a lack of specialized methods for human desire understanding despite its close relationship with emotion and sentiment.

Method: Proposes a symmetrical bidirectional framework with text-image mutual guidance, using low-resolution images for global representations and high-resolution sub-images with masked image modeling for fine-grained features. Includes text-guided image decoder and image-guided text decoder for deep cross-modal interaction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding, 0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis on the MSED dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed symmetrical bidirectional multimodal learning framework effectively captures intention-related representations and demonstrates consistent improvements across desire, emotion, and sentiment recognition tasks.

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by addressing false positives and improving temporal context capture without requiring additional training.

Method: Introduces two components: (1) Video-Language Checker to verify subject/action presence in videos, reducing false positives; (2) Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames for better temporal context.

Result: Achieved J&F score of 64.14% on MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in RVOS track of 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025.

Conclusion: The training-free framework successfully improves RVOS performance by incorporating explicit verification mechanisms and adaptive frame selection, demonstrating effective enhancement of existing methods without additional training costs.

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GS is a novel framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting with multi-appearance capabilities for sparse-view scene reconstruction, leveraging monocular depth priors and geometry-guided supervision to overcome overfitting and achieve photorealistic renderings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-the-wild photo collections often have limited imagery with multiple appearances (different times, seasons), making scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis challenging. Existing NeRF and 3DGS adaptations tend to oversmooth and overfit in sparse-view scenarios.

Method: Built on geometric priors from monocular depth estimations, uses SfM points anchored algorithm for local semantic region extraction, and introduces geometry-guided supervision at virtual views with fine-grained and coarse schemes to ensure 3D consistency and reduce overfitting.

Result: MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions, significantly outperforming existing approaches across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MS-GS framework effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges by leveraging geometric priors and multi-view constraints, demonstrating superior performance in realistic in-the-wild scenarios.

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-Feat is a framework that extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, fuses them for multi-label classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification requires powerful representations that can capture multi-label interactions. Existing methods may not fully leverage the rich intermediate features available in diffusion-Transformer models.

Method: Extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models at specific timesteps and blocks, uses a heuristic local-search algorithm to find optimal image-text √ó block-timestep pairs, and fuses features via linear projection and addition.

Result: Achieves 98.6% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7% mAP on Visual Genome 500, surpassing CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines. t-SNE and clustering metrics show tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Conclusion: Diff-Feat demonstrates that carefully selected intermediate features from diffusion-Transformer models can create powerful representations for multi-label classification, with consistent optimal performance observed at specific layers (e.g., Layer 12 for images).

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address preventable disability from vision/hearing diseases in resource-constrained settings where specialists are scarce and paper-based workflows dominate, with limited documented field experience for scalable AI-assisted screening.

Method: Iterative interdisciplinary collaboration through early prototyping, shadow deployment, continuous feedback, and treating AI development and workflow digitization as an end-to-end co-design process.

Result: Public datasets and AI models are useful despite domain shift issues, and automated AI-based image quality checks are needed for robust screening in high-volume camps.

Conclusion: Successful deployment requires treating AI development and workflow digitization as an iterative co-design process, with documented practical challenges providing actionable field knowledge for building real-world AI-assisted telehealth programs.

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

TL;DR: DC-Mamba introduces an 'align-then-enhance' framework with BTDA for geometric alignment and SSCA for change signal amplification, significantly improving RSCD performance over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing change detection methods, including state-of-the-art SSMs, lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and struggle to distinguish subtle true changes from noise.

Method: Built on ChangeMamba backbone, DC-Mamba integrates two modules: Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA) for geometric correction at semantic feature level, and Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier (SSCA) for selective amplification of high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvement: F1-score increased from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU from 0.4015 to 0.4187 compared to the ChangeMamba baseline.

Conclusion: The 'align-then-enhance' strategy effectively addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in remote sensing change detection, offering a robust and easily deployable solution.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

TL;DR: Blink-Think-Link (BTL) is a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics human cognitive processes, achieving state-of-the-art performance in GUI understanding and interaction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven GUI interaction systems deviate from natural human communication patterns, creating a gap in how humans naturally interact with graphical interfaces.

Method: The framework decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: Blink (rapid detection/attention), Think (reasoning/decision-making), and Link (executable command generation). It includes automated blink data generation and a novel rule-based reward mechanism for reinforcement learning.

Result: The BTL-UI agent model demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework provides conclusive empirical validation for developing advanced GUI agents that better mimic natural human cognitive processes in interface interaction.

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

*Shilong Bao,Qianqian Xu,Feiran Li,Boyu Han,Zhiyong Yang,Xiaochun Cao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses size bias in Salient Object Detection (SOD) metrics by proposing a Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework and optimization method (SIOpt) that prevents larger objects from dominating evaluation scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD metrics are inherently size-sensitive, causing larger objects to dominate evaluation outcomes while overlooking smaller but potentially more important objects, leading to biased performance assessments.

Method: Proposes SIEva framework that evaluates each object component individually then aggregates results, and SIOpt optimization framework that adheres to size-invariant principles for detecting objects across size ranges.

Result: The approach effectively mitigates size imbalance impact, enhances detection of salient objects across sizes, and provides theoretical generalization analysis supporting the new evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed size-invariant evaluation and optimization framework addresses fundamental limitations in SOD metrics, enabling more balanced and accurate assessment of salient object detection performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust solution for identifying fake news in short video platforms and paves the way for more reliable approaches in combating misinformation through effective multimodal fusion techniques.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short video platforms has necessitated advanced
methods for detecting fake news. This need arises from the widespread influence
and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal
harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of
short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel
multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate
the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that
dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted
Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with
incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV
(VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news
detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV
datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over
state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of
effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video
platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in
combating misinformation.

*Zheng Wang,Hong Liu,Zheng Wang,Danyi Li,Min Cen,Baptiste Magnier,Li Liang,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rasa framework uses pathology reports and LLMs to enhance WSI-based survival analysis through self-distillation and risk-aware mix-up strategies


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional WSI-based survival analysis faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, while pathology reports contain rich patient information that remains unexplored for enhancing WSI analysis

Method: Uses LLMs to extract fine-grained WSI-relevant descriptions from pathology reports, implements self-distillation pipeline to filter irrelevant WSI features, and incorporates risk-aware mix-up strategy for data augmentation

Result: Extensive experiments on CRC and TCGA-BRCA datasets demonstrate superior effectiveness against state-of-the-art methods

Conclusion: The proposed Rasa framework successfully leverages pathology reports to improve WSI-based survival analysis through effective feature filtering and data augmentation

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

*Zhuoyao Liu,Yang Liu,Wentao Feng,Shudong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCSR framework improves cross-modal retrieval by addressing noisy correspondences through pseudo-label consistency-based sample refinement and adaptive optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal retrieval methods assume perfect image-text alignment, ignoring real-world noisy correspondences that degrade performance. Current approaches use simplistic clean/noisy categorizations and uniform training strategies, failing to account for diverse characteristics within noisy samples.

Method: Proposes Pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR) with confidence-based estimation to distinguish clean/noisy pairs, pseudo-label consistency analysis to identify structurally distinct subsets, and Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO) using different loss functions and text replacement strategies based on sample characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and Flickr30K demonstrate improved retrieval robustness under noisy supervision compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PCSR framework effectively handles noisy correspondences in cross-modal retrieval by leveraging pseudo-label consistency for sample refinement and adaptive optimization, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A personalized federated SAM framework for medical image segmentation that addresses privacy constraints and data heterogeneity through parameter aggregation and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy constraints hinder medical data sharing across institutions, and existing federated learning approaches struggle with complex heterogeneous data. SAM's massive encoder poses challenges in federated settings.

Method: Integrates two innovations: (1) personalized strategy aggregating only global parameters while retaining L-MoE for domain-specific features; (2) decoupled global-local fine-tuning using teacher-student knowledge distillation to bridge global and local models.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show significant improvement in segmentation performance, robust cross-domain adaptation, and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses privacy and heterogeneity challenges in medical image segmentation while maintaining high performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

TL;DR: UNIV is a biologically inspired unified foundation model for RGB-visible and infrared modalities that achieves superior cross-modal performance through patch-wise contrastive learning and dual-knowledge preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of multimodal perception where pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data underperform when used together, particularly for applications like autonomous vehicles that require robust performance under diverse weather conditions.

Method: Proposes two key innovations: 1) Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL) - an attention-guided distillation framework mimicking retinal horizontal cells' lateral inhibition for cross-modal feature alignment; 2) Dual-knowledge preservation mechanism using LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, emulating retina's photopic and scotopic functionality.

Result: Superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+ of baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Introduces MVIP dataset with 98,992 aligned image pairs.

Conclusion: UNIV demonstrates effective cross-modal learning through biologically inspired mechanisms, providing a unified foundation model that excels in both infrared and visible modalities while preventing performance degradation in either domain.

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

### [105] [GS-Scale: Unlocking Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting Training via Host Offloading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15645)
*Donghyun Lee,Dawoon Jeong,Jae W. Lee,Hongil Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Scale is a memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables large-scale scene training on consumer GPUs by storing Gaussians in host memory and using selective offloading optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes requires substantial GPU memory for parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which overwhelms consumer-grade GPU memory capacity.

Method: GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory and transfers subsets to GPU on demand. It employs three optimizations: selective geometric parameter offloading for fast frustum culling, parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and deferred optimizer updates for Gaussians with zero gradients.

Result: GS-Scale reduces GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x while maintaining comparable training speeds to GPU-only methods. It enables scaling from 4M to 18M Gaussians on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, achieving 23-35% LPIPS improvement.

Conclusion: The system successfully enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer GPUs through efficient memory management and computational optimizations.

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel contactless fingerprint recognition framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for 3D registration, reconstruction, and generation from sparse 2D images without camera parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contactless fingerprint recognition underperforms contact-based methods due to insufficient data with pose variations and lack of 3D fingerprint representations. The authors aim to bridge this gap by leveraging 3D reconstruction techniques.

Method: The proposed framework integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve 3D fingerprint registration and reconstruction from sparse 2D contactless fingerprint images, without requiring camera parameters. It also enables generation of high-quality contactless fingerprints from the reconstructed 3D models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate accurate 3D fingerprint alignment and reconstruction from 2D images, with the generated contactless fingerprints significantly improving recognition performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This work presents the first application of 3D Gaussian Splatting to fingerprint recognition, establishing a new paradigm that effectively addresses the limitations of current contactless fingerprint systems through 3D reconstruction and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

### [107] [A PCA Based Model for Surface Reconstruction from Incomplete Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15675)
*Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A PCA-based model for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data that uses estimated normal information as a regularizer to guide reconstruction in missing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud data often has missing regions due to scanning limitations like high light-absorption and occlusions, making complete surface reconstruction challenging.

Method: Uses PCA to estimate surface normal information from available point cloud data, then employs this as a regularizer in the reconstruction model with an operator-splitting solution method.

Result: The model successfully infers surface structures in data-missing regions and reconstructs underlying surfaces, outperforming existing methodologies.

Conclusion: The PCA-based approach with normal information regularization provides an effective solution for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data.

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Camera Splatting is a novel view synthesis framework that models cameras as 3D Gaussians and optimizes views by refining these camera splats to achieve better target distributions observed from virtual point cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve novel view synthesis by better capturing complex view-dependent phenomena like metallic reflections and intricate textures, which existing methods like Farthest View Sampling (FVS) struggle with.

Method: Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian (camera splat), and virtual point cameras are placed near surfaces to observe camera splat distributions. View optimization is achieved through differentiable refinement of camera splats to match desirable target distributions.

Result: The optimized views outperform FVS in capturing complex view-dependent effects, particularly intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

Conclusion: Camera Splatting provides a more effective framework for novel view synthesis, especially for scenes with challenging view-dependent phenomena.

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,

*Sidra Hanif,Longin Jan Latecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a conditional diffusion model for handwriting stroke generation that incorporates multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation and word layout information for consistent word spacing, outperforming state-of-the-art stroke generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous handwriting stroke generation methods failed to consider word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, leading to inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. The authors aim to improve calligraphic style imitation by incorporating both local/global style features and word layout information.

Method: The paper proposes: 1) multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation that highlight local and global style features, 2) inclusion of word layout to facilitate word spacing, and 3) a conditional diffusion model that predicts strokes (rather than style images) guided by calligraphic style and word layout.

Result: Experimentation shows the proposed diffusion model outperforms current state-of-the-art stroke generation methods and is competitive with recent image generation networks.

Conclusion: The conditional diffusion model with multi-scale attention features and word layout guidance enables better handwriting imitation and stroke generation in calligraphic style by providing temporal coordinate information that is lacking in image generation approaches.

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage vision method inspired by human saccadic vision for fine-grained visual classification, using peripheral features and fixation patches with contextual attention to address spatial redundancy in part-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing part-based FGVC methods suffer from complex localization networks, limited feature utility, and high spatial redundancy in sampled points, making it difficult to determine optimal part numbers.

Method: Two-stage process: extracts peripheral features to generate sample map, samples fixation patches using non-maximum suppression to avoid redundancy, encodes patches with weight-shared encoder, and fuses representations using contextualized selective attention.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art on standard FGVC benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101, Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths, AMI-Moths), consistently outperforming baseline encoder.

Conclusion: The human saccadic vision-inspired approach effectively addresses spatial redundancy in part-based FGVC methods while maintaining competitive performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets and improve contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text by leveraging structured multi-object scene compositions.

Method: Uses individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairs them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model, and augments contrastive training with these compositional samples.

Result: Substantial performance gains across multiple tasks including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart, improved 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, and robust generalization to retrieval scenarios with increasing complexity.

Conclusion: SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic and consistently improve performance across multiple encoder architectures, demonstrating effective spatial reasoning capabilities and addressing 3D-text data scarcity through structured scene compositions.

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to

*Zhaoyang Li,Zhan Ling,Yuchen Zhou,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORIC, a benchmark to evaluate Large Vision-Language Models' object recognition in incongruous contexts where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when expected, revealing significant recognition gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are prone to errors in incongruous contexts, leading to object misidentification and hallucination, which needs systematic examination.

Method: ORIC uses two strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling to identify contextually incongruous objects, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling to detect plausible but nonexistent objects likely to be hallucinated.

Result: Evaluation of 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models shows significant recognition gaps when faced with contextual incongruity.

Conclusion: The work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

*Yuxuan Liang,Xu Li,Xiaolei Chen,Yi Zheng,Haotian Chen,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTP is a training-free token pruning strategy that reduces computational overhead in LVLMs by selectively retaining tokens from visually salient regions and instruction-relevant areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models struggle with high-resolution images due to excessive visual tokens causing exponential computational overhead during inference.

Method: Pyramid Token Pruning integrates bottom-up visual saliency at region/token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance, inspired by human visual attention mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments across 13 benchmarks show substantial reduction in computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: PTP effectively addresses efficiency issues in LVLMs processing high-resolution images through selective token pruning based on visual saliency and task relevance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

### [114] [SGMAGNet: A Baseline Model for 3D Cloud Phase Structure Reconstruction on a New Passive Active Satellite Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15706)
*Chi Yang,Fu Wang,Xiaofei Yang,Hao Huang,Weijia Cao,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark dataset and baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into 3D cloud phase structures using deep learning models, with SGMAGNet achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction as they affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. The research aims to improve cloud microphysics parameterization in NWP systems.

Method: Uses multimodal satellite observations (VIS/TIR imagery from geostationary satellites and vertical cloud phase profiles from CALIOP/CALIPSO lidar and CPR/CloudSat radar) to create synchronized image-profile pairs. Adopts SGMAGNet and compares it with UNet variants and SegNet for cloud phase reconstruction.

Result: SGMAGNet achieves superior performance with Precision of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and IoU of 0.617, significantly outperforming baseline models, especially in complex multi-layer and boundary transition regions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms multimodal satellite data into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, demonstrating potential for operational cloud phase profile retrieval and integration with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization.

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

*Shuaibo Li,Zhaohu Xing,Hongqiu Wang,Pengfei Hao,Xingyu Li,Zekai Liu,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedForensics dataset and DSKI detector address AI-generated medical image threats by creating comprehensive medical forensics resources and a dual-stage detection method that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging poses serious risks including diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and misinformation, but existing forensic methods are inadequate for medical images and there's a lack of specialized datasets.

Method: Introduces MedForensics dataset (6 medical modalities, 12 generative models) and DSKI detector with cross-domain fine-trace adapter for spatial/noise domain analysis and medical forensic retrieval module for few-shot retrieval.

Result: DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed MedForensics dataset and DSKI detector effectively address the critical need for specialized medical image forensics, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in detecting AI-generated medical images.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

### [116] [TrueMoE: Dual-Routing Mixture of Discriminative Experts for Synthetic Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15741)
*Laixin Zhang,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueMoE is a dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework for synthetic image detection that uses multiple specialized discriminative subspaces instead of a single universal space, achieving better generalization across diverse generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic image detection methods use a single universal discriminative space which tends to be complex, brittle, and struggles to generalize to unseen generative patterns.

Method: Proposes TrueMoE with a Discriminative Expert Array organized along manifold structure and perceptual granularity axes, using dual-routing (granularity-aware sparse router and manifold-aware dense router) to adaptively assign inputs to relevant experts.

Result: Extensive experiments show TrueMoE achieves superior generalization and robustness across a wide spectrum of generative models.

Conclusion: The collaborative inference across multiple specialized discriminative subspaces is more effective than single-space approaches for synthetic image detection.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

*Tony Lindeberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops mathematical relationships between receptive field responses at different scales and parameters, providing tools for efficient computation and biological vision modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle variability in real-world image structures under natural transformations by establishing formal relationships between receptive field responses across different parameter values.

Method: Derives (i) infinitesimal relationships using semi-groups and Lie groups concepts, and (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties describing how coarser-scale responses can be computed from finer-scale outputs.

Result: Established mathematical relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different filter parameters, enabling more efficient computation schemes.

Conclusion: The results provide deeper understanding of receptive field relationships, enabling improved computational efficiency and better theoretical models for biological vision systems.

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FloorSAM is a framework that combines point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate building floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data, outperforming traditional methods in noisy and complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for floor plan reconstruction from point clouds suffer from noise sensitivity, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details, creating a need for more robust and accurate approaches.

Method: The framework uses grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement to create top-down density maps, then applies SAM's zero-shot learning for room segmentation with adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization.

Result: Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets demonstrate superior accuracy, recall, and robustness compared to traditional methods, particularly in noisy and complex settings.

Conclusion: FloorSAM effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating SAM's segmentation capabilities with point cloud processing, enabling accurate floor plan reconstruction and recovery of room topological relationships.

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

*Zhengyang Yu,Arthur Aubret,Chen Yu,Jochen Triesch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modeling foveated vision with varying resolution improves self-supervised learning of object representations from egocentric videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning models ignore the foveated nature of human vision, which has high resolution in the center and low resolution in the periphery of the visual field.

Method: Used egocentric videos with foveation models and cortical magnification to create inputs with decreasing resolution towards the periphery, then trained bio-inspired self-supervised models with time-based learning objectives.

Result: Foveated vision modeling improves object representation quality by making objects appear bigger and creating better trade-off between central and peripheral information.

Conclusion: Incorporating foveated vision aspects makes models of human visual learning more realistic and performant.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

*Yang Li,Tingfa Xu,Shuyan Bai,Peifu Liu,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCOD is the first multispectral benchmark dataset for camouflaged object detection, addressing limitations of RGB-only datasets by providing comprehensive challenge attributes, diverse scenarios, and high-quality annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking support for multispectral approaches despite their potential for enhanced foreground-background discrimination in challenging conditions.

Method: Introducing MCOD dataset with three key advantages: comprehensive challenge attributes (small objects, extreme lighting), diverse real-world scenarios, and high-quality pixel-level manual annotations with precise object masks and attribute labels.

Result: Benchmarking 11 representative COD methods on MCOD revealed consistent performance drops due to increased difficulty, but multispectral modality integration substantially alleviated this degradation, demonstrating the value of spectral information.

Conclusion: MCOD provides a strong foundation for future multispectral COD research and highlights that spectral information enhances detection robustness, with the dataset publicly available for community use.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The PlantCLEF 2024 challenge introduces a new test set for multi-label plant species identification from plot images, using AI to enhance ecological studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of ecological studies by leveraging AI for automated plant species identification in plot images, enabling larger-scale and more comprehensive biodiversity assessments.

Method: The challenge uses a multi-label classification task where participants predict all plant species present in high-resolution plot images, utilizing a training set of 1.7 million individual plant images and pre-trained vision transformer models.

Result: The paper provides a detailed description of the data, evaluation methodology, participant methods, and results, but specific performance metrics are not mentioned in the abstract.

Conclusion: The PlantCLEF 2024 challenge aims to advance AI capabilities in ecological research by providing standardized datasets and evaluation frameworks for multi-label plant species identification.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants
and the results achieved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM3D improves text-to-3D generation by integrating vision-language models into Score Distillation Sampling to address semantic alignment and 3D consistency issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDS-based methods have two key limitations: poor semantic alignment due to CLIP-style text encoders struggling with fine-grained prompts, and geometric inconsistencies from 2D diffusion priors lacking explicit 3D spatial constraints.

Method: Proposes VLM3D framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) as differentiable semantic and spatial priors into the SDS pipeline, using Qwen2.5-VL model to provide rich language-grounded supervision and spatial understanding.

Result: VLM3D significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods on GPTeval3D benchmark across diverse objects and complex scenes, achieving better semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs into SDS pipelines effectively addresses fundamental limitations of existing text-to-3D generation methods by leveraging VLMs' superior semantic alignment and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cutie and SAM2 each have limitations in feature capacity and temporal modeling, so combining their complementary strengths can improve video object segmentation performance.

Method: Replace Cutie's encoder with SAM2's ViT encoder, introduce motion prediction module for temporal stability, and use ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and the proposed variant.

Result: Achieved 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge, demonstrating effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion prediction.

Conclusion: The SCOPE framework effectively combines enriched feature representation from SAM2 with Cutie's segmentation capabilities and temporal modeling, providing robust video object segmentation.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

*Xiang Chen,Fengting Zhang,Qinghao Liu,Min Liu,Kun Wu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegReg is a segmentation-driven registration framework that uses anatomically adaptive regularization to handle regionally varying deformations in medical image registration, outperforming existing methods by 2-12% across cardiac, abdominal, and lung imaging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning registration approaches use globally uniform smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate complex, regionally varying deformations characteristic of anatomical motion, limiting their effectiveness in medical image registration.

Method: SegReg first decomposes input images into anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation, processes these localized domains with the same registration backbone to compute optimized partial deformation fields, and integrates them into a global deformation field.

Result: SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23% Dice on critical anatomies) with ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms existing methods by 2-12% across cardiac, abdominal, and lung registration scenarios even with automatic segmentation.

Conclusion: SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on segmentation quality, effectively transforming the registration challenge into a segmentation problem, providing a robust framework for anatomically adaptive medical image registration.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBPNet addresses plasticity loss in continual learning by adaptively reinitializing underutilized parameters in frozen pretrained models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods using frozen pretrained models suffer from plasticity loss - diminished ability to learn new knowledge due to frozen backbones and limited prompt capacity. This creates a critical bottleneck for real-time applications like robotics and autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet) with an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by adaptively reinitializing underutilized parameters during training, restoring learning vitality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.41% on Split ImageNet-R and improves average accuracy by over 1% on Split CIFAR-100, while training only 0.2% additional parameters compared to backbone size.

Conclusion: CBPNet effectively addresses plasticity loss in continual learning, demonstrating superior performance with high parameter efficiency, making it suitable for edge devices requiring real-time responses.

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

*Haotian Zhang,Han Guo,Keyan Chen,Hao Chen,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LevirSCD, a new benchmark dataset for remote sensing semantic change detection with fine-grained categories, and proposes FoBa, a foreground-background co-guided method with gated interaction fusion to improve change detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two major challenges in remote sensing semantic change detection: limited datasets with insufficient change categories and coarse class definitions, and underutilization of change information in current methods that treat it as post-processing.

Method: Proposes FoBa (foreground-background co-guided SCD) method that leverages foreground regions of interest and contextual backgrounds collaboratively. Introduces Gated Interaction Fusion (GIF) module and consistency loss for bi-temporal interaction and spatial consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND, JL1, and LevirSCD) show FoBa achieves competitive results with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%, and 2.81% in SeK metric respectively compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LevirSCD dataset and FoBa method effectively address current limitations in remote sensing semantic change detection, providing fine-grained categorization and improved change detection performance through collaborative foreground-background guidance and enhanced temporal interaction.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

### [127] [Minimal Semantic Sufficiency Meets Unsupervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15791)
*Tan Pan,Kaiyu Guo,Dongli Xu,Zhaorui Tan,Chen Jiang,Deshu Chen,Xin Guo,Brian C. Lovell,Limei Han,Yuan Cheng,Mahsa Baktashmotlagh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MS-UDG, a novel approach for Unsupervised Domain Generalization that learns Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representations by optimizing for sufficiency (preserving semantic information) and minimality (removing irrelevant information) without requiring domain labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised domain generalization methods often rely on domain labels which are unavailable in real-world scenarios. There's a need to enhance generalization of unsupervised learning models without such supervision.

Method: MS-UDG integrates an InfoNCE-based objective for sufficiency, plus a semantic-variation disentanglement loss and reconstruction mechanism for minimality, theoretically grounded in information theory.

Result: MS-UDG achieves state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods.

Conclusion: The proposed minimal sufficient semantic representation framework effectively addresses UDG challenges without requiring category or domain labels, demonstrating strong theoretical foundations and practical performance.

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

*Tianyang Wang,Xi Xiao,Gaofei Chen,Hanzhang Chi,Qi Zhang,Guo Cheng,Yingrui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASAM extends SAM with terrain and temporal awareness for remote sensing segmentation, achieving better performance than zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with remote sensing data due to complex terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics, requiring domain-specific adaptations.

Method: Integrates three lightweight modules: terrain-aware adapter for elevation priors, temporal prompt generator for land-cover changes, and multi-scale fusion for fine-grained object delineation without retraining SAM backbone.

Result: Substantial performance gains across LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD benchmarks, outperforming both zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive augmentation enhances foundation models for geospatial segmentation, offering a scalable path toward more robust performance.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

*Kehua Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChronoForge-RL is a novel video understanding framework that addresses computational inefficiency and semantic frame selection challenges through Temporal Apex Distillation and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods struggle with computational infeasibility of processing every frame and difficulty in identifying semantically significant frames through uniform sampling strategies.

Method: Combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) for keyframe selection via variation scoring, inflection detection, and prioritized distillation, and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) using contrastive learning with saliency-enhanced reward mechanism.

Result: Achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench, surpassing previous approaches while enabling a 7B parameter model to match performance of 72B parameter alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses computational efficiency and semantic frame selection challenges in video understanding, demonstrating superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models exhibit significant 'brand bias' - generating content featuring dominant commercial brands from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks.

Method: CIDER uses a lightweight detector to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate stylistically divergent alternatives. It introduces Brand Neutrality Score (BNS) to quantify bias.

Result: Extensive experiments show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal.

Conclusion: CIDER offers a practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to trustworthy generative AI development.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

*Het Patel,Muzammil Allie,Qian Zhang,Jia Chen,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight defense method using tensor decomposition to protect vision language models from adversarial attacks without requiring retraining or architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision language models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses are costly as they require retraining or significant architectural modifications.

Method: Using tensor decomposition and reconstruction of vision encoder representations to filter adversarial noise while preserving semantic meaning, with optimal parameters being Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual strength (Œ±=0.1-0.2).

Result: On Flickr30K, the method restored 12.3% performance lost to attacks (Recall@1 accuracy improved from 7.5% to 19.8%). On COCO, it recovered 8.1% performance (accuracy improved from 3.8% to 11.9%).

Conclusion: This provides a practical, plug-and-play defense solution with minimal overhead that can be applied to any pre-trained VLM without retraining.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

### [132] [Boosting Active Learning with Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15805)
*Tianyang Wang,Xi Xiao,Gaofei Chen,Xiaoying Liao,Guo Cheng,Yingrui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Active Learning method using knowledge transfer between teacher and student models for uncertainty estimation, applicable to various tasks including cryo-ET classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty estimation methods in Active Learning require complex auxiliary models and special training techniques that are difficult to implement, especially for domain-specific tasks like cryo-ET classification.

Method: Proposes a teacher-student framework where the teacher is the task model and the student is a task-agnostic auxiliary model. Both models are trained simultaneously in each AL cycle, using distance between their outputs to measure uncertainty for unlabeled data.

Result: Extensive experiments on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges demonstrate the method's efficacy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective uncertainty estimation approach that doesn't rely on special training techniques and shows that data uncertainty relates to the upper-bound of task loss rather than concrete loss values.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

### [133] [LC-SLab -- An Object-based Deep Learning Framework for Large-scale Land Cover Classification from Satellite Imagery and Sparse In-situ Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15868)
*Johannes Leonhardt,Juergen Gall,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LC-SLab is a deep learning framework for object-based land cover classification using sparse supervision, addressing fragmentation issues in traditional pixel-wise methods by aggregating predictions at input or output levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning land cover mapping methods produce fragmented and noisy predictions when using sparse in-situ datasets. Object-based classification offers a solution but remains underexplored, especially for medium-resolution imagery with sparse supervision.

Method: LC-SLab supports two approaches: input-level aggregation via graph neural networks and output-level aggregation by postprocessing semantic segmentation results. It also incorporates features from large pre-trained networks to improve performance on small datasets.

Result: Object-based methods match or exceed pixel-wise model accuracy while producing more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation works better on smaller datasets, while output-level aggregation performs best with more data. LC-SLab outperforms existing land cover products.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates practical utility for large-scale land cover classification, effectively balancing accuracy and fragmentation while being robust to sparse supervision conditions.

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Manzano is a unified multimodal LLM framework that reduces performance trade-offs between visual understanding and generation by using a hybrid image tokenizer and shared training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source multimodal LLMs suffer from performance trade-offs between visual understanding and generation capabilities, creating a need for a unified solution.

Method: Uses a shared vision encoder with two lightweight adapters producing continuous embeddings for understanding and discrete tokens for generation. Combines autoregressive LLM for semantic prediction with diffusion decoder for pixel generation, trained jointly on understanding and generation data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, competitive with specialist models, especially on text-rich evaluation. Shows minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size.

Conclusion: The hybrid tokenizer design is validated as effective for scalable joint learning of multimodal understanding and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

TL;DR: GVR is a zero-shot 3D visual grounding framework that transforms 3D object localization into 2D view retrieval, eliminating the need for per-scene training and large labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DVG methods struggle with implicit spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting and require extensive labeled data and per-scene training, making them impractical for real-world applications.

Method: Proposes Grounding via View Retrieval (GVR) that uses object-level view retrieval to collect grounding clues from multiple 2D views, avoiding 3D annotations and per-scene training by treating 3DVG as a 2D retrieval task.

Result: Extensive experiments show GVR achieves state-of-the-art visual grounding performance without per-scene training, providing a foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research.

Conclusion: GVR offers an effective zero-shot solution for 3D visual grounding that is more practical and scalable than existing methods by leveraging 2D view retrieval instead of direct 3D processing.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

Result: Achieved DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of 2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597 on hidden test set, outperforming VISTA3D and SAM-Med3D, matching SegVol in some metrics. Ranked 5th overall and best among non-pretrained approaches.

Conclusion: ENSAM demonstrates that effective 3D medical image segmentation can be achieved with limited resources, with relative positional encodings and Muon optimizer being key contributors to performance.

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a
lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation.
ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossI2P is a self-supervised framework for image-to-point cloud registration that bridges 2D-3D modalities through cross-modal learning and two-stage registration, achieving state-of-the-art performance on autonomous driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich images and metrically precise point clouds, and overcome local optima convergence in existing I2P registration methods.

Method: Uses dual-path contrastive learning for geometric-semantic embedding, coarse-to-fine registration with superpoint-superpixel correspondences, and dynamic training with gradient normalization for balanced loss optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on KITTI Odometry and 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: CrossI2P effectively bridges 2D-3D sensor modalities through unified cross-modal learning and two-stage registration, demonstrating superior performance for autonomous perception systems.

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

*Xiaosheng Long,Hanyu Wang,Zhentao Song,Kun Luo,Hongde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACap is a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning that addresses limitations in fine-grained relation modeling by mining structured relation semantics from retrieval captions and identifying heterogeneous objects from images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented image captioning methods have limitations in relation modeling: coarse-grained semantic prompts that fail to capture fine-grained relationships, and lack of explicit modeling of image objects and their semantic relationships.

Method: RACap mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions and identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. It effectively retrieves structured relation features containing heterogeneous visual information to enhance semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.

Result: RACap achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning models with only 10.8M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed RACap model successfully addresses relation modeling challenges in retrieval-augmented image captioning by incorporating fine-grained structured relation features and explicit object relationship modeling.

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

*Jiahao Li,Xinhong Chen,Zhengmin Jiang,Qian Zhou,Yung-Hui Li,Jianping Wang*

TL;DR: GREAT-Stereo is a framework that enhances iterative stereo matching methods by incorporating global context through three attention modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative stereo matching methods like RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo struggle in ill-posed regions (occlusions, textureless areas, repetitive patterns) due to lack of global context and geometric information for effective refinement.

Method: Proposes GREAT framework with three attention modules: Spatial Attention (SA) for global context in spatial dimension, Matching Attention (MA) for global context along epipolar lines, and Volume Attention (VA) that works with SA and MA to build robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details.

Result: GREAT-IGEV ranks first on Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and second on Middlebury benchmark among all published methods. The framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.

Conclusion: The GREAT framework effectively enables iterative stereo matching methods to incorporate global context, significantly improving performance in difficult regions and achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

TL;DR: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are stateful neural networks that use feedback mechanisms to iteratively refine internal states, outperforming feedforward networks in noisy and data-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce dynamics into static neural architectures by mimicking biological decision-making processes through feedback mechanisms, aiming for more robust and generalizable learning.

Method: Model the feedback process as a differential equation solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to ensure convergence.

Result: DFMs consistently outperform feedforward counterparts in object recognition and segmentation tasks, particularly in low data or high noise regimes, and show strong performance in medical imaging with robustness to noise corruption.

Conclusion: Feedback mechanisms are crucial for achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning in neural networks, with DFMs demonstrating superior performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

*Olivier Moliner,Viktor Larsson,Kalle √Östr√∂m*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free open-vocabulary 3D object detection using 2D foundation models and sparse-view RGB images


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object detection methods are limited to fixed categories and require dense 3D data. This work addresses the practical sparse-view setting with open-vocabulary capability.

Method: Lifts 2D detections from pre-trained models and optimizes 3D proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, avoiding expensive 3D feature fusion or 3D-specific training.

Result: Establishes a powerful baseline that performs competitively with state-of-the-art in dense scenarios and significantly outperforms them in sparse-view settings.

Conclusion: Simple pipeline leveraging 2D foundation models effectively addresses open-vocabulary 3D detection in sparse-view scenarios without requiring 3D training.

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

TL;DR: A novel camera-radar fusion approach for 3D object detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved inference time by using radar point clouds in bird's-eye-view with a new backbone architecture and self-attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-radar fusion provides a robust, low-cost alternative to camera-lidar fusion for real-time 3D object detection under adverse weather and lighting conditions, but current literature lacks architectures that fully exploit radar advantages like accurate distance estimation and speed information.

Method: Proposes a new 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and radars in bird's-eye-view (BEV) with a novel backbone that maps radar pillar features into embedded dimensions using self-attention to model dependencies between radar points, and replaces FPN-based convolutional layers with simplified convolutional layers to reduce inference time.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 58.2 NDS metric using ResNet-50 and sets new benchmark for inference time on nuScenes dataset in the same category.

Conclusion: The proposed camera-radar fusion approach demonstrates superior performance and efficiency, establishing new standards for real-time 3D object detection while leveraging radar's unique advantages over lidar-based systems.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

Conclusion: The method provides effective yield prediction across diverse conditions, offering valuable insights to assist farmers in decision-making and potentially improving crop yields.

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores explainable AI methods for Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) networks, evaluating Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different MDE models and introducing a new metric called Attribution Fidelity to assess explanation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world applications, creating a need to understand how MDE networks map input images to predicted depth maps.

Method: The study investigates feature attribution methods (Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, Attention Rollout) on MDE models (METER and PixelFormer), assesses explanation quality through selective pixel perturbation, and introduces Attribution Fidelity metric to evaluate explanation reliability.

Result: Saliency Maps perform well for lightweight MDE models, while Integrated Gradients work better for deep models. Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies when explainability methods fail to produce reliable visual maps, even when conventional metrics suggest satisfactory results.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that different explainability methods suit different MDE model complexities, and Attribution Fidelity provides a more reliable way to assess explanation quality than existing metrics.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

Motivation: Single-vehicle perception has limitations due to instability, which affects trajectory prediction accuracy in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Uses Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filtering for early fusion, Past Time Attention (PTA) module for interaction capture, mode attention module for prediction diversity, and anchor-oriented decoder for trajectory generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, demonstrating high completeness and accuracy in cooperative trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: CoPAD effectively addresses limitations of single-vehicle perception and validates the effectiveness of cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing spurious 3D points. While sharp edges typically require fine-grained supervision, this work aims to achieve crisp depth discontinuities using only self-supervision.

Method: Models per-pixel depth as a mixture distribution that captures multiple plausible depths, shifting uncertainty from direct regression to mixture weights. Integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions and uncertainty propagation.

Result: Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show the method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed mixture distribution formulation enables self-supervised monocular depth estimation with crisp boundaries, outperforming existing methods in boundary sharpness and point cloud quality.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuproCL replaces single semantic targets with multiple context-aware prototypes to address semantic ambiguity and intra-class visual diversity in language-guided continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single semantic targets from pretrained language models cause two issues: semantic ambiguity (polysemous category names lead to conflicting visual representations) and intra-class visual diversity (single prototypes fail to capture visual variety within classes).

Method: Uses a lightweight LLM agent for category disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate multiple semantic prototypes, with LogSumExp aggregation for adaptive alignment between vision model and most relevant prototype per image.

Result: Extensive experiments across various continual learning baselines show MuproCL consistently enhances performance and robustness.

Conclusion: MuproCL establishes a more effective path for language-guided continual learning by addressing limitations of single-target approaches.

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal image matching faces challenges due to significant appearance differences between modalities and scarcity of annotated datasets. Existing deep learning methods perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation from VFMs (DINOv2/DINOv3) to build lightweight student models, injects modality category information to retain modality-specific details, and employs V2I-GAN for visible-to-infrared translation for data augmentation.

Result: Experiments show DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses multimodal matching challenges by leveraging VFM's generalizable features while preserving modality-specific information through innovative distillation and augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CauMVC is a causal multi-view clustering network that addresses the challenge of partially aligned data in multi-view clustering by modeling it as a causal intervention problem and using variational auto-encoders for invariant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view clustering often faces the problem of partial data alignment across views, which violates the common assumption of view consistency and reduces clustering performance. Existing methods assume fully aligned data, but practical scenarios frequently have only partial alignment.

Method: The paper proposes CauMVC, which uses causal modeling to treat partially aligned data as an intervention. It employs a Variational Auto-Encoder with an encoder to estimate invariant features and a decoder for post-intervention inference, along with a contrastive regularizer to capture sample correlations.

Result: Empirical experiments demonstrate that CauMVC shows strong generalization and effectiveness on both fully and partially aligned data, outperforming existing methods in handling the data order shift problem.

Conclusion: This is the first work to address generalized multi-view clustering through causal learning, providing a novel framework that effectively handles the practical challenge of partial data alignment across views.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLip is a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework for robust visual speech recognition that addresses real-world challenges like illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes through a dual-path feature extraction and two-stage progressive learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. The authors aim to create a more robust system that can handle these adverse conditions effectively.

Method: GLip uses a dual-path feature extraction architecture integrating global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. Stage 1 learns coarse alignment between visual features and speech content using audio-visual data. Stage 2 introduces a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with global context across spatial and temporal dimensions.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms existing methods on LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks and demonstrates enhanced robustness against various visual challenges. It also shows effectiveness on a newly introduced challenging Mandarin dataset.

Conclusion: GLip's progressive learning strategy that exploits discriminative local regions while maintaining global context provides superior robustness for visual speech recognition in challenging real-world conditions compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Motivation: Existing surface reconstruction methods rely heavily on ground truth normals or approximate normals, making them unreliable for noisy point clouds. Traditional B-spline methods use fixed control points, limiting their ability to match surface complexity.

Method: Developed a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network that simultaneously predicts both the location and number of control points for B-spline surface reconstruction, eliminating the need for point normals.

Result: The method outperforms several well-known and recent baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively across widely-used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective solution for generating smooth surfaces from noisy point clouds without normal dependency, offering superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: LIR-GAD is a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with specialized tokens for group activity detection, improving contextual reasoning and explainability over traditional visual-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for group activity detection rely solely on implicit visual pattern recognition and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. The authors aim to leverage MLLMs' commonsense knowledge to address these limitations.

Method: The approach expands MLLM vocabulary with activity-level <ACT> tokens and cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens. It processes video frames with these tokens and language instructions through MLLM, uses multi-label classification loss for semantic learning, and integrates embeddings with visual features via a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion module.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate superior performance in group activity detection tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LIR-GAD framework effectively leverages MLLMs' commonsense knowledge through specialized tokens and multimodal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance in group activity detection with improved explainability.

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE&TREK is a training-free prompting framework that enhances spatial understanding of MLLMs using visual diversity and motion reconstruction principles without requiring additional training or GPU resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on modalities like depth or point clouds for spatial reasoning, but purely visual spatial understanding remains underexplored in MLLMs under vision-only constraints.

Method: Uses Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling to extract semantically rich keyframes for visual diversity, and simulates visual trajectories with encoded relative spatial positions for motion reconstruction. Requires only a single forward pass and integrates seamlessly with existing MLLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on VSI-BENCH and STI-BENCH show consistent performance boosts across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, with up to +3.5% improvement.

Conclusion: SEE&TREK offers a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence in MLLMs through training-free visual enhancement techniques.

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of blind-spot networks (which sacrifice local details and cause pixel discontinuities) and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to self-supervised denoising without paired training data.

Method: Proposes a dual-branch diffusion framework with a BSN-based diffusion branch generating semi-clean images and a conventional diffusion branch capturing noise distributions. Uses BSN-based branch to guide sampling process for effective training without paired data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SIDD and DND datasets, demonstrating highly effective self-supervised denoising capabilities.

Conclusion: The method establishes an effective self-supervised solution for real-world image denoising, with code and pre-trained models publicly released.

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

TL;DR: AdaSports-Traj is an adaptive trajectory modeling framework that addresses distribution discrepancies in multi-agent sports scenarios through role- and domain-aware adaptation and hierarchical contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified frameworks fail to capture structured distributional shifts across different agent roles (players vs. ball) and sports domains, leading to suboptimal generalization in trajectory prediction.

Method: Proposes AdaSports-Traj with: 1) Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on agent identity and domain context; 2) Hierarchical Contrastive Learning objective that separately supervises role-sensitive and domain-aware representations for disentangled latent structures.

Result: Experiments on Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U datasets demonstrate strong performance in both unified and cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

Conclusion: The adaptive design effectively addresses intra-domain and inter-domain distribution discrepancies in sports trajectory prediction, achieving superior generalization across roles and domains.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

*Jinyuan Qu,Hongyang Li,Xingyu Chen,Shilong Liu,Yukai Shi,Tianhe Ren,Ruitao Jing,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDINO3D is a Transformer encoder-decoder framework for 3D instance segmentation that leverages pre-trained 2D detection models to enhance 3D representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D training data is generally insufficient compared to 2D images, so the paper aims to leverage rich 2D representations from pre-trained 2D detection models to improve 3D instance segmentation performance.

Method: The framework takes point clouds and associated 2D images as input. It enriches 3D points with 2D image features, uses a 3D encoder for context fusion, and performs cross-attention between 3D anchor box queries and 2D object queries from pre-trained 2D models.

Result: SegDINO3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 benchmarks, with significant improvements of +8.7 and +6.8 mAP on ScanNet200 validation and test sets respectively.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges 2D and 3D representations, demonstrating that leveraging pre-trained 2D models can significantly boost 3D instance segmentation performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

### [159] [RadarGaussianDet3D: An Efficient and Effective Gaussian-based 3D Detector with 4D Automotive Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16119)
*Weiyi Xiong,Bing Zhu,Tao Huang,Zewei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadarGaussianDet3D is a novel 4D radar-based 3D detector that uses Gaussian primitives and distributions to overcome limitations of existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with faster inference for real-time autonomous driving applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D radar detectors suffer from sparse feature maps due to pillar encoders, sub-optimal detection accuracy from independent bounding box optimization, and insufficient inference speed for vehicle-mounted embedded devices.

Method: Proposes RadarGaussianDet3D with: 1) Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) that transforms points into Gaussian primitives using 3D Gaussian Splatting for denser BEV feature maps, 2) Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) that converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions for more comprehensive optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art detection accuracy with substantially faster inference speed compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: RadarGaussianDet3D shows strong potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving by addressing key limitations of current 4D radar detectors through Gaussian-based representations.

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) through exhaustive experimental analysis, introducing BaseReward as a new SOTA baseline that outperforms previous models on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge, but there's currently a lack of systematic guidance for building effective Multimodal Reward Models in both academia and industry.

Method: Systematically investigated every crucial component in MRM development pipeline including reward modeling paradigms, reward head architecture, training strategies, data curation, backbone model and scale, and ensemble methods. Introduced BaseReward built on Qwen2.5-VL backbone with optimized two-layer reward head trained on curated multimodal and text-only preference data.

Result: BaseReward establishes new SOTA on major benchmarks (MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, Multimodal Reward Bench) and successfully enhances MLLM performance across perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks when integrated into real-world reinforcement learning pipelines.

Conclusion: This work delivers a top-tier MRM and provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for next-generation MLLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

TL;DR: Recovering 3D parametric scene geometry using very few (as few as 15) low-resolution time-of-flight sensor measurements through a combined feed-forward prediction and differentiable rendering approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable 3D geometry recovery from sparse measurements using commercially available low-cost time-of-flight sensors that offer single-pixel resolution but capture detailed time-of-flight data.

Method: Combines feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters with differentiable rendering in an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine parameter estimates.

Result: Successfully recovers object pose given untextured 3D models in both simulations and real-world captures, with promising results for other parametric scenes.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates feasibility of using distributed sparse measurements for 3D geometry recovery and explores the limits of this imaging solution.

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AcT2I, a benchmark for evaluating text-to-image models on action-centric prompts, and proposes a training-free knowledge distillation technique using LLMs to enhance prompts with temporal details, achieving 72% improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models struggle with accurately rendering complex scenes involving actions and interactions, often missing nuanced attributes and contextual dependencies in action depiction.

Method: Developed AcT2I benchmark for systematic evaluation, then created a training-free knowledge distillation technique using Large Language Models to enhance prompts across three dimensions, with temporal details proving most effective.

Result: Leading T2I models performed poorly on AcT2I, but the proposed method achieved a 72% increase in image generation accuracy by incorporating temporal details into prompts.

Conclusion: Current T2I methods have limitations in complex reasoning tasks, but systematic integration of linguistic knowledge through prompt enhancement can significantly improve generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs exhibit visual sycophantic behavior that worsens with image inputs, creating a "sycophantic modality gap." The paper proposes Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT) to reduce this behavior without making models overly stubborn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the pronounced visual sycophantic behavior in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that becomes more prominent when processing image inputs compared to text-only LLMs.

Method: Proposed Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT), which enables MLLMs to engage in reflective reasoning to determine if user instructions are misleading or corrective before drawing conclusions.

Result: SRT significantly reduces sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions without causing excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective instructions.

Conclusion: SRT effectively mitigates the visual sycophantic behavior in MLLMs by balancing resistance to misleading instructions while maintaining responsiveness to corrective feedback.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

TL;DR: UniMRSeg is a unified modality-relax segmentation network that handles incomplete/corrupted modalities through hierarchical self-supervised compensation, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal segmentation methods require specialized models for each modality combination, leading to high deployment costs. There's a need for a unified approach that can handle various missing modality scenarios efficiently.

Method: Uses hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC) across three levels: modality reconstruction with hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, modality-invariant contrastive learning, and lightweight reverse attention adapter. Fine-tuned under hybrid consistency constraint.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, and RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.

Conclusion: UniMRSeg provides an effective unified solution for multi-modal segmentation with missing modalities, reducing deployment complexity while maintaining high performance across various applications.

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

TL;DR: The paper introduces dynamic role profiles for role-playing agents by incorporating video modality, creating a large-scale dataset (Role-playing-Video60k), and developing a framework that combines adaptive temporal sampling with both dynamic and static profile representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for role-playing agents focus on static role profiles, overlooking the dynamic perceptual abilities inherent to humans that enable understanding of temporal and visual context.

Method: Constructed Role-playing-Video60k dataset (60k videos, 700k dialogues). Developed RPA framework with adaptive temporal sampling: dynamic profile from video frames in temporal order, static profile from character dialogues and summary context. Proposed 8-metric evaluation method.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, showing that dynamic role profiles significantly improve RPA performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic role profiles are crucial for developing effective role-playing agents, and the proposed video-based framework successfully bridges the gap between static profiles and human-like dynamic perception.

Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPAs) have attracted growing interest for their ability
to simulate immersive and interactive characters. However, existing approaches
primarily focus on static role profiles, overlooking the dynamic perceptual
abilities inherent to humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of
dynamic role profiles by incorporating video modality into RPAs. To support
this, we construct Role-playing-Video60k, a large-scale, high-quality dataset
comprising 60k videos and 700k corresponding dialogues. Based on this dataset,
we develop a comprehensive RPA framework that combines adaptive temporal
sampling with both dynamic and static role profile representations.
Specifically, the dynamic profile is created by adaptively sampling video
frames and feeding them to the LLM in temporal order, while the static profile
consists of (1) character dialogues from training videos during fine-tuning,
and (2) a summary context from the input video during inference. This joint
integration enables RPAs to generate greater responses. Furthermore, we propose
a robust evaluation method covering eight metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the importance of
dynamic role profiles in developing RPAs.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: VoXtream is a fully autoregressive, zero-shot streaming text-to-speech system that achieves extremely low initial delay (102ms) while maintaining competitive quality in real-time streaming scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a real-time TTS system that can begin speaking immediately from the first word without delaying onset, addressing the need for low-latency streaming applications.

Method: Uses a monotonic alignment scheme with dynamic look-ahead, built around three transformers: incremental phoneme transformer, temporal transformer predicting semantic/duration tokens, and depth transformer producing acoustic tokens.

Result: Achieves 102ms initial delay on GPU (lowest among publicly available streaming TTS), matches or surpasses larger baselines on several metrics despite being trained on a mid-scale 9k-hour corpus.

Conclusion: VoXtream demonstrates that competitive streaming TTS quality can be achieved with minimal latency, making it suitable for real-time applications requiring immediate speech onset.

Abstract: We present VoXtream, a fully autoregressive, zero-shot streaming
text-to-speech (TTS) system for real-time use that begins speaking from the
first word. VoXtream directly maps incoming phonemes to audio tokens using a
monotonic alignment scheme and a dynamic look-ahead that does not delay onset.
Built around an incremental phoneme transformer, a temporal transformer
predicting semantic and duration tokens, and a depth transformer producing
acoustic tokens, VoXtream achieves, to our knowledge, the lowest initial delay
among publicly available streaming TTS: 102 ms on GPU. Despite being trained on
a mid-scale 9k-hour corpus, it matches or surpasses larger baselines on several
metrics, while delivering competitive quality in both output- and
full-streaming settings. Demo and code are available at

### [168] [Incorporating Visual Cortical Lateral Connection Properties into CNN: Recurrent Activation and Excitatory-Inhibitory Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15460)
*Jin Hyun Park,Cheng Zhang,Yoonsuck Choe*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes adding lateral connections (recurrent activation and excitatory/inhibitory separation) to CNNs to better mimic the biological visual system, showing improved accuracy and biological plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNNs lack lateral connections within feature maps that exist in the mammalian visual system, limiting their biological fidelity and potentially their performance.

Method: Modeled lateral connections using recurrent CNNs with weight sharing and a custom loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory connections.

Result: The addition of lateral connections increased classification accuracy and produced activation/connection properties similar to biological visual systems.

Conclusion: This approach helps align CNNs closer to biological counterparts and improves understanding of visual cortical computation principles.

Abstract: The original Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their modern updates
such as the ResNet are heavily inspired by the mammalian visual system. These
models include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and
long-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas).
However, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each
visual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would
roughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important
architectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we
present how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN
framework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in
relation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main
architectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2)
separation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN
using weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom
loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of
these two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the
activation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show
properties similar to those observed in the biological visual system. We expect
our approach to help align CNN closer to its biological counterpart and better
understand the principles of visual cortical computation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel framework for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction that extends NeuralAngelo to dynamic settings using template-based deformation fields


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic reconstruction methods produce noisy or overly smooth meshes, lacking geometric fidelity needed for detailed dynamic scene reconstruction

Method: Start with high-quality template reconstruction from initial frame using NeuralAngelo, then jointly optimize deformation fields to track template and refine geometry based on temporal sequence

Result: Superior reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on ActorsHQ dataset

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables highly detailed dynamic reconstruction by combining template-based approach with flexible deformation modeling

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction from multi-view videos remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. While recent neural surface reconstruction
methods have achieved remarkable results in static 3D reconstruction, extending
these approaches with comparable quality for dynamic scenes introduces
significant computational and representational challenges. Existing dynamic
methods focus on novel-view synthesis, therefore, their extracted meshes tend
to be noisy. Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too
smooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem. We present a novel
framework for highly detailed dynamic reconstruction that extends the static 3D
reconstruction method NeuralAngelo to work in dynamic settings. To that end, we
start with a high-quality template scene reconstruction from the initial frame
using NeuralAngelo, and then jointly optimize deformation fields that track the
template and refine it based on the temporal sequence. This flexible template
allows updating the geometry to include changes that cannot be modeled with the
deformation field, for instance occluded parts or the changes in the topology.
We show superior reconstruction accuracy in comparison to previous
state-of-the-art methods on the ActorsHQ dataset.

*Edward P. Chandler,Shirin Shoushtari,Brendt Wohlberg,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an analysis formulation of Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) that applies learned denoisers in the gradient domain rather than the image domain, extending total variation regularization to learned regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PnP methods apply denoisers directly in the image domain as implicit priors. The authors explore an alternative approach where the prior is imposed on transformed representations like image gradients, conceptually extending TV regularization to learned regularization.

Method: Train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the gradient domain instead of the image domain. Develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting (APnP-HQS) and alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM) to incorporate this gradient-domain prior.

Result: The analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain PnP algorithms on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: Gradient-domain PnP provides an effective alternative to standard image-domain PnP, demonstrating that learned priors can be successfully applied in transformed representations while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a popular framework for solving imaging inverse
problems by integrating learned priors in the form of denoisers trained to
remove Gaussian noise from images. In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is
applied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural
images. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in
which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such
as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the
gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an
extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization.
To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms,
we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting
(APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We
evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating
that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain
PnP algorithms.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive focal loss function for prostate capsule segmentation in micro-ultrasound images, addressing challenges with ambiguous boundaries and annotation variability to improve segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with prostate capsule segmentation due to ambiguous boundaries and annotation variability between experts and non-experts, motivating the development of a tailored approach that can handle these challenges.

Method: The proposed method integrates a standard focal loss function as baseline and develops an adaptive focal loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions based on difficulty levels and annotation variability. It dilates hard regions identified through expert vs non-expert annotation discrepancies to better identify fuzzy capsule regions.

Result: The adaptive focal loss function achieved superior performance with a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in testing, demonstrating significant improvement in segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The study shows that integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive techniques enhances prostate capsule segmentation accuracy in micro-US images, potentially improving clinical decision-making for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a promising imaging technique for cancer
detection and computer-assisted visualization. This study investigates prostate
capsule segmentation using deep learning techniques from micro-US images,
addressing the challenges posed by the ambiguous boundaries of the prostate
capsule. Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the
development of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal
loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking
into account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The
proposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal
loss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for
proper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust
foundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are
difficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility,
addressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability
by dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert
and non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the
segmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the
prostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates
superior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a
mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset. These results
highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive
techniques into deep learning models. This enhances the accuracy of prostate
capsule segmentation in micro-US images, offering the potential to improve
clinical decision-making in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing breast tumor segmentation methods struggle with irregular tumor shapes and fail to effectively integrate local and global features, limiting diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Uncertainty-gated deformable network incorporating deformable feature modeling in both convolution and attention modules, with Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module (U-GEM) for selective feature exchange and Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss for improved boundary delineation.

Result: Superior segmentation performance demonstrated on two clinical breast MRI datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows strong clinical potential for accurate breast tumor delineation by effectively addressing irregular shapes and feature integration challenges.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of breast tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is
essential for breast cancer diagnosis, yet existing methods face challenges in
capturing irregular tumor shapes and effectively integrating local and global
features. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-gated
deformable network to leverage the complementary information from CNN and
Transformers. Specifically, we incorporates deformable feature modeling into
both convolution and attention modules, enabling adaptive receptive fields for
irregular tumor contours. We also design an Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module
(U-GEM) to selectively exchange complementary features between CNN and
Transformer based on pixel-wise uncertainty, enhancing both local and global
representations. Additionally, a Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss is
introduced to further improve tumor boundary delineation. Comprehensive
experiments on two clinical breast MRI datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art
methods, highlighting its clinical potential for accurate breast tumor
delineation.

Motivation: Large-scale pre-training has shown benefits for medical image segmentation but remains underexplored for 3D object detection, with existing methods failing to fully leverage 3D volumetric information.

Method: Systematically studied how existing pre-training methods can be integrated into state-of-the-art detection architectures (both CNNs and Transformers) across various tasks and datasets.

Result: Pre-training consistently improves detection performance, with reconstruction-based self-supervised pre-training outperforming supervised pre-training, while contrastive pre-training provides no clear benefit.

Conclusion: This work establishes the importance of pre-training for 3D medical object detection and demonstrates that reconstruction-based self-supervised methods are most effective for this task.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training holds the promise to advance 3D medical object
detection, a crucial component of accurate computer-aided diagnosis. Yet, it
remains underexplored compared to segmentation, where pre-training has already
demonstrated significant benefits. Existing pre-training approaches for 3D

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SLaM-DiMM is a diffusion model-based framework that generates missing MRI modalities from available ones, ensuring structural coherence across brain volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In clinical practice, not all four MRI modalities (T1ce, T1w, T2w, Flair) are always available, creating a need for missing modality generation to enable downstream medical image analysis tasks.

Method: The proposed SLaM-DiMM framework uses diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities, incorporating a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism to maintain structural consistency across volume depth.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset show the approach effectively generates anatomically plausible and structurally consistent MRI modality images.

Conclusion: SLaM-DiMM provides a robust solution for missing modality generation in brain MRI analysis, enabling models to leverage complementary information even when some modalities are unavailable.

Abstract: Brain MRI scans are often found in four modalities, consisting of T1-weighted
with and without contrast enhancement (T1ce and T1w), T2-weighted imaging
(T2w), and Flair. Leveraging complementary information from these different
modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for
understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as
anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are
always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation
a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose
SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the
power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities
from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity
images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume
through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing
anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods struggle with segmenting small, irregular, or anatomically complex organs and primarily focus on spatial-domain analysis, overlooking the potential benefits of frequency-domain representations.

Method: The framework integrates Multi-axis External Weight Block (MEWB) for multi-axis frequency-domain feature extraction and improved dual attention module (DA+) with depthwise separable convolutions and attention mechanisms for enhanced feature fusion and reduced redundancy.

Result: On the Synapse dataset, FMD-TransUNet achieved an average DSC of 81.32% and HD of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs, representing a 3.84% DSC improvement and 15.34 mm HD reduction compared to baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed FMD-TransUNet effectively improves abdominal multi-organ segmentation accuracy by leveraging complementary frequency-domain information and enhanced attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Accurate abdominal multi-organ segmentation is critical for clinical
applications. Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation
methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular,
or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on
spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of
frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ
segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block
(MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet
framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture
both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing
complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block
utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel
attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information,
and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental
validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other
recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD
of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the
average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the
accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand group learning processes and outcomes through analysis of discussion dialogs in flipped classrooms, which contain rich information about student learning progression.

Method: Recorded and transcribed in-class group discussions from a flipped classroom course, extracted features using multiple tools and customized processing techniques, performed statistical analyses to identify relevant indicators, and applied machine learning algorithms for outcome prediction.

Result: The best prediction accuracy reached 78.9% for classifying group learning outcomes as High, Mid, or Low, demonstrating feasibility of automatic prediction from discussion dialogs.

Conclusion: The study successfully shows that automatic learning outcome prediction from group discussion dialogs in flipped classrooms is feasible and effective.

Abstract: The flipped classroom is a new pedagogical strategy that has been gaining
increasing importance recently. Spoken discussion dialog commonly occurs in
flipped classroom, which embeds rich information indicating processes and
progression of students' learning. This study focuses on learning analytics
from spoken discussion dialog in the flipped classroom, which aims to collect
and analyze the discussion dialogs in flipped classroom in order to get to know
group learning processes and outcomes. We have recently transformed a course
using the flipped classroom strategy, where students watched video-recorded
lectures at home prior to group-based problem-solving discussions in class. The
in-class group discussions were recorded throughout the semester and then
transcribed manually. After features are extracted from the dialogs by multiple
tools and customized processing techniques, we performed statistical analyses
to explore the indicators that are related to the group learning outcomes from
face-to-face discussion dialogs in the flipped classroom. Then, machine
learning algorithms are applied to the indicators in order to predict the group

*Chi Liu,Derek Li,Yan Shu,Robin Chen,Derek Duan,Teng Fang,Bryan Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fleming-R1 is a medical reasoning model that achieves expert-level clinical reasoning through three innovations: Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS), Chain-of-Thought cold start, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The 7B variant surpasses larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with expert-level clinical reasoning due to the need for both accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. Current models lack verifiable medical reasoning capabilities required for safe deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.

Method: Three complementary innovations: 1) RODS combining curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis, 2) Chain-of-Thought cold start to distill reasoning trajectories from teacher models, 3) Two-stage RLVR framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization with adaptive hard-sample mining.

Result: Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives across diverse medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. The model enables transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI for safer clinical deployment.

Abstract: While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving
expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both
accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical
reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our
Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets
with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented
diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning
trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third,
we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core
reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive
hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers
substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much
larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and
consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results
demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and
verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple
accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent,
reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment
in high-stakes clinical environments.

### [182] [Small LLMs with Expert Blocks Are Good Enough for Hyperparamter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15561)
*Om Naphade,Saksham Bansal,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Expert Block Framework using Small LLMs for hyper-parameter tuning, achieving performance close to GPT-4 with much smaller models by using a Trajectory Context Summarizer to structure training trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyper-parameter tuning is computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Current LLM-based HPT approaches rely on massive models exceeding 100B parameters, which is inefficient.

Method: Developed an Expert Block Framework with Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS) that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs (phi4:14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) to perform HPT effectively.

Result: Using only a 10-trial budget, the TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Small LLMs can achieve comparable HPT performance to large models when equipped with proper context structuring mechanisms like TCS, making HPT more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML)
pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most
rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block
Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context
Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training
trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze
optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two
locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial
budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9
percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

*Vaibhav Singh,Soumya Suvra Ghosal,Kapu Nirmal Joshua,Soumyabrata Pal,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a principled information theory-driven approach for selecting optimal examples in in-context learning (ICL) by framing it as a query-specific optimization problem with diversity regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional nearest-neighbor methods for ICL example selection suffer from poor generalization and lack of diversity in high-dimensional embedding spaces. The authors aim to develop a more principled approach that maximizes performance for specific queries rather than focusing on general generalization.

Method: Model LLMs as linear functions over input embeddings and formulate example selection as a query-specific optimization problem. Use an approximately submodular surrogate objective with greedy algorithm, enhanced by kernel trick for high-dimensional spaces and optimal design-based regularizer for diversity.

Result: Significant improvements over standard retrieval methods across multiple classification tasks, demonstrating the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection in label-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed principled approach to example selection in ICL outperforms traditional methods by optimizing for specific queries and ensuring diversity, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications with limited labeled data.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to new and data-scarce tasks using only a few
carefully selected task-specific examples presented in the prompt. However,
given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which
examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?
While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for
this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional
embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In
this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,
information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear
function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a
query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a
larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.
This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning
theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query
instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately
submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation
guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick
to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and
(ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in
the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements
over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks,
highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL
in real-world, label-scarce scenarios.

*Xinchen Wan,Jinhua Liang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmoHeal is a personalized digital mental wellness system that uses AI to detect fine-grained emotions from user text and delivers supportive narratives through music therapy principles, showing significant mood improvement in user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing digital mental wellness tools are static and one-size-fits-all, failing to adapt to individual emotional needs. Pre-sleep anxiety affects over 1.5 billion people worldwide, highlighting the need for more nuanced, personalized approaches.

Method: EmoHeal uses a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model to detect 27 fine-grained emotions from user text, maps them to musical parameters via a knowledge graph based on music therapy principles (GEMS, iso-principle), and retrieves audiovisual content using CLAMP3 model to guide users through a "match-guide-target" approach.

Result: A within-subjects study (N=40) showed significant supportive effects with substantial mood improvement (M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05, p<0.001). Strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates the fine-grained approach.

Conclusion: The findings establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools and provide a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy principles.

Abstract: Existing digital mental wellness tools often overlook the nuanced emotional
states underlying everyday challenges. For example, pre-sleep anxiety affects
more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, yet current approaches remain largely
static and "one-size-fits-all", failing to adapt to individual needs. In this
work, we present EmoHeal, an end-to-end system that delivers personalized,
three-stage supportive narratives. EmoHeal detects 27 fine-grained emotions
from user text with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model, mapping them to musical
parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music therapy principles (GEMS,
iso-principle). EmoHeal retrieves audiovisual content using the CLAMP3 model to
guide users from their current state toward a calmer one
("match-guide-target"). A within-subjects study (N=40) demonstrated significant
supportive effects, with participants reporting substantial mood improvement
(M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05,
p<0.001). A strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic
outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates our fine-grained approach. These findings
establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools
and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy
principles.

### [185] [SABER: Uncovering Vulnerabilities in Safety Alignment via Cross-Layer Residual Connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16060)
*Maithili Joshi,Palash Nandi,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SABER is a novel white-box jailbreak method that bypasses LLM safety mechanisms by connecting intermediate layers with residual connections, achieving 51% improvement over baselines on HarmBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite extensive safety alignment training, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can bypass their safety mechanisms, which are found to be predominantly embedded in middle-to-late layers.

Method: SABER connects two intermediate layers (s < e) through a residual connection to bypass safety mechanisms, leveraging the finding that safety features are concentrated in middle-to-late layers.

Result: The method achieves 51% improvement over best-performing baselines on HarmBench test set with only marginal perplexity shift on validation set.

Conclusion: SABER demonstrates that residual connections between intermediate layers can effectively bypass LLM safety mechanisms, highlighting vulnerabilities in current alignment approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with safe-alignment training are powerful
instruments with robust language comprehension capabilities. These models
typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to
ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.
However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to
produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,
we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the
middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box
jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which
connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a
residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the
best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces
only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation
set. The source code is publicly available at

### [186] [Latent learning: episodic memory complements parametric learning by enabling flexible reuse of experiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16189)
*Andrew Kyle Lampinen,Martin Engelcke,Yuxuan Li,Arslan Chaudhry,James L. McClelland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning systems fail to generalize due to lack of latent learning - learning information not immediately relevant but potentially useful later. Cognitive science suggests episodic memory as a solution, and retrieval mechanisms can improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why ML systems fail to generalize and identify mechanisms to improve generalization, drawing inspiration from cognitive science concepts like latent learning.

Method: Analyzed failures like reversal curse in language modeling and agent navigation, then tested systems with oracle retrieval mechanisms and studied essential components for effective retrieval including within-example in-context learning.

Result: Systems with retrieval mechanisms can use learning experiences more flexibly and generalize better across various challenges. Within-example in-context learning is crucial for using information across retrieved examples.

Conclusion: Lack of latent learning contributes to ML's data inefficiency compared to natural intelligence. Retrieval methods complement parametric learning to improve generalization, with episodic memory-inspired approaches showing promise.

Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms
could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive
science to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure
to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the
task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this
perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling
to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive
science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these
issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval
mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better
across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential
components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of
within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information
across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible
contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning
systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval
methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.

*Yue Song,T. Anderson Keller,Sevan Brodjian,Takeru Miyato,Yisong Yue,Pietro Perona,Max Welling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A score-based generative model using stochastic Kuramoto dynamics for orientation-rich images like fingerprints and textures, leveraging phase synchronization as an inductive bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard isotropic Euclidean diffusion struggles with coherent angular directional patterns in orientation-rich images. Biological phase synchronization in Kuramoto models provides a natural framework for structured image generation.

Method: Forward process performs synchronization among phase variables using coupled oscillator interactions, collapsing data into low-entropy von Mises distribution. Reverse process performs desynchronization using learned score function, with wrapped Gaussian kernels and periodicity-aware networks for circular geometry.

Result: Competitive results on general image benchmarks and significant quality improvements on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired synchronization dynamics show promise as structured priors in generative modeling, enabling hierarchical generation that refines global coherence into fine-scale details.

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired
synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

### [188] [Global Pre-fixing, Local Adjusting: A Simple yet Effective Contrastive Strategy for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15347)
*Jia Tang,Xinrui Wang,Songcan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPLASC is a contrastive learning strategy for continual learning that uses global pre-fixing with equiangular tight frames to separate task representations and local adjusting to maintain intra-task discriminative features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive continual learning methods suffer from confusion between inter-task and intra-task features, limiting their performance in preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The method divides the representation hypersphere into non-overlapping regions using ETF centers for inter-task separation, while allowing intra-task adjustable ETFs within each region to maintain discriminative feature structures.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively addresses feature confusion and can be integrated into existing contrastive continual learning frameworks.

Conclusion: GPLASC simultaneously ensures discriminative feature structures both between and within tasks, providing an effective solution for contrastive continual learning.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from
evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging
contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful
representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,
their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both
inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple
yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing,
\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the
entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with
the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular
\textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our
method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs
within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method
\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between
tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing
contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

*Zinan Lin,Enshu Liu,Xuefei Ning,Junyi Zhu,Wenyu Wang,Sergey Yekhanin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Zoning Network (LZN) proposes a unified framework that addresses generative modeling, representation learning, and classification using a shared Gaussian latent space with disjoint zones for different data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify three core ML problems (generative modeling, representation learning, classification) that currently have disjoint state-of-the-art solutions, simplifying ML pipelines and enabling synergy across tasks.

Method: LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space where each data type (images, text, labels) has dedicated encoders and decoders. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these components - e.g., label-conditional generation uses label encoder + image decoder, classification uses image encoder + label decoder.

Result: LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59 when combined with Rectified Flow; outperforms MoCo and SimCLR by 9.3% and 0.2% respectively on ImageNet linear classification; achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy on CIFAR10 while improving FID in joint tasks.

Conclusion: LZN demonstrates that a unified principle can effectively address multiple core ML problems, showing promise for simplifying ML pipelines and creating synergistic task interactions through shared latent representations.

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three
core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)
solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified
principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and
foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)
as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent
space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,
text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent
zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as
compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional
image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses
an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We
demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN
can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA
Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without
modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently
(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation
learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and
SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear
classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously
(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,
LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA
classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we
propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory

this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence
guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy

Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across
hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate
HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular
patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced

math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while
ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

TL;DR: A novel framework that uses Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data for imbalanced classification, training only a linear classifier to achieve state-of-the-art performance while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for imbalanced classification using foundation models require substantial computational resources and still fail to match performance on balanced datasets. There's a need for more efficient and simpler approaches.

Method: Leverages the rich semantic latent space of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data, then trains a simple linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail classification.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100-LT benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on Places-LT benchmark, with computational efficiency from reducing trainable parameters to just those in the linear model.

Conclusion: The proposed simple and effective approach using synthetic data generation from foundation models is highly effective for long-tail classification while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine
learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on
underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research
has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these
models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive
performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close
the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require
substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.
Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this
work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space
of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple
linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail
classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of
trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the
linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT
benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark,
highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current leukemia diagnosis relies on manual microscopic analysis which is complex and time-consuming. Existing AI solutions use private datasets and only cover parts of the diagnostic pipeline.

Method: Created a comprehensive public dataset with 246 pediatric patients, over 40,000 annotated cells, and proposed AI methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.

Result: AI models achieved: average precision of 0.96 for cell detection, AUC of 0.98 and F1-score of 0.61 for 33-class cell classification, and mean F1-score of 0.90 for diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches demonstrate usefulness for AI-assisted diagnostics, and the public dataset will foster further research to improve leukemia diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone
marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it
complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the
diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly
available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process,
from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose
methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The
dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and
laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and
more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most
comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded
an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of
0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean
F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.
While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted
diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the
field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient
outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn compact and informative representations from raw multivariate time series without labels for efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE) with two complementary pretext tasks: reconstructing masked values and estimating latent representations of masked features guided by a teacher encoder, plus feature-level alignment constraint.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate consistent and superior performance over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: DMAE effectively learns temporally coherent and semantically rich representations through joint optimization of dual reconstruction tasks and alignment constraints.

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to
extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without
relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked
time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning.
DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked
values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations
of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve
representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that
encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's
outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally
coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations
across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our
approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive
baselines.

Motivation: Existing RL methods for diffusion models have limitations including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance.

Method: DiffusionNFT optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching, contrasting positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction.

Result: DiffusionNFT is 25x more efficient than FlowGRPO, improves GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, and significantly boosts SD3.5-Medium performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiffusionNFT provides an efficient, CFG-free RL paradigm for diffusion models that works with arbitrary solvers and requires only clean images for optimization.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language
models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to
intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process
to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,
including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated
integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion
Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that
optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.
DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit
policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals
into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with
arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and
requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy
optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in
head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT
improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO
achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging
multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of
SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

TL;DR: Dynamic CFG scheduling framework that adapts guidance scales per timestep based on online feedback from quality evaluations, outperforming static guidance approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static guidance scales in classifier-free guidance (CFG) fail to adapt to diverse prompt requirements, and prior solutions are complex and non-generalizable.

Method: Leverages online feedback from latent-space evaluations (CLIP, discriminator, human preference model) to perform greedy search for optimal CFG scale at each diffusion timestep, creating prompt-specific guidance schedules.

Result: Significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning; achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate vs Imagen 3 baseline (55.5% on text rendering prompts).

Conclusion: Optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent; the framework provides an efficient and generalizable solution.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion
models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.
This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of
different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or
fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to
generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a
framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from
a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space
evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a
human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the
reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search
to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance
schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,
showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text
rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default
Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate
for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts
targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that
the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and
provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

TL;DR: LLMs integrated with EHR systems via Model Context Protocol (MCP) can autonomously retrieve clinical data with near-perfect accuracy in simple tasks, though complex time-dependent tasks present challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to access electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals, overcoming current limitations of restricted EHR system access, and evaluate their ability to retrieve clinically relevant information autonomously.

Method: Developed EHR-MCP framework with custom MCP tools integrated with hospital EHR database, using GPT-4.1 through LangGraph ReAct agent. Tested six infection control team tasks on eight patients, comparing against physician-generated gold standards.

Result: LLM consistently selected correct MCP tools with near-perfect accuracy in most tasks. Performance was lower in complex time-dependent calculations. Errors mainly from incorrect arguments or tool result misinterpretation. Responses were reliable but risked exceeding context window with repetitive data.

Conclusion: LLMs can successfully retrieve clinical data from EHRs via MCP in real hospital settings, providing secure infrastructure for hospital AI agents. Future work should extend to reasoning, generation, and clinical impact assessment for effective AI integration into clinical practice.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their
deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health
record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration
between LLMs and external tools.
  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP
can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital
setting.
  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated
with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct
agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the
infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were
retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was
measured.
  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.
Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was
lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors
arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses
from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding
the context window.
  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a
real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while
highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for
secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI
agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation,
and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of
generative AI into clinical practice.

*Qiaolin Wang,Xilin Jiang,Linyang He,Junkai Wu,Nima Mesgarani*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SightSound-R1 is a cross-modal distillation framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from vision-language models to audio-language models using audio-visual question answering data, improving audio reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large audio-language models lag behind vision-language models in reasoning capabilities due to lack of large-scale chain-of-thought audio data for teaching stepwise reasoning.

Method: Three-step framework: (i) test-time scaling to generate audio-focused chains of thought from LVLM teacher, (ii) audio-grounded validation to filter hallucinations, (iii) distillation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for LALM student.

Result: SightSound-R1 improves LALM reasoning performance in both in-domain AVQA test set and unseen auditory scenes/questions, outperforming pretrained and label-only distilled baselines.

Conclusion: Vision reasoning can be effectively transferred to audio models and scaled with abundant audio-visual data.

Abstract: While large audio-language models (LALMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art
audio understanding, their reasoning capability in complex soundscapes still
falls behind large vision-language models (LVLMs). Compared to the visual
domain, one bottleneck is the lack of large-scale chain-of-thought audio data
to teach LALM stepwise reasoning. To circumvent this data and modality gap, we
present SightSound-R1, a cross-modal distillation framework that transfers
advanced reasoning from a stronger LVLM teacher to a weaker LALM student on the
same audio-visual question answering (AVQA) dataset. SightSound-R1 consists of
three core steps: (i) test-time scaling to generate audio-focused chains of
thought (CoT) from an LVLM teacher, (ii) audio-grounded validation to filter
hallucinations, and (iii) a distillation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for the LALM
student. Results show that SightSound-R1 improves LALM reasoning performance
both in the in-domain AVQA test set as well as in unseen auditory scenes and
questions, outperforming both pretrained and label-only distilled baselines.
Thus, we conclude that vision reasoning can be effectively transferred to audio
models and scaled with abundant audio-visual data.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SimulSA is a strategy that enables large audio-language models to perform simultaneous speech-to-text translation without architectural changes by using self-augmented simultaneous data from truncated speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To activate simultaneous speech-to-text translation capabilities in large audio-language models without requiring architectural modifications or decoding strategy changes.

Method: SimulSA randomly truncates speech and constructs partially aligned translations to create simultaneous training data, then incorporates this data (about 1% of full offline data) into supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results show that adding only about 1% of simultaneous data significantly activates LALMs' Simul-S2TT capabilities without model architecture or decoding modifications.

Conclusion: SimulSA effectively bridges the distribution gap between offline and simultaneous translation, enabling base models to perform real-time speech translation through minimal data augmentation.

Abstract: Simultaneous speech-to-text translation (Simul-S2TT) aims to translate speech
into target text in real time, outputting translations while receiving source
speech input, rather than waiting for the entire utterance to be spoken.
Simul-S2TT research often modifies model architectures to implement read-write
strategies. However, with the rise of large audio-language models (LALMs), a
key challenge is how to directly activate Simul-S2TT capabilities in base
models without additional architectural changes. In this paper, we introduce
{\bf Simul}taneous {\bf S}elf-{\bf A}ugmentation ({\bf SimulSA}), a strategy
that utilizes LALMs' inherent capabilities to obtain simultaneous data by
randomly truncating speech and constructing partially aligned translation. By
incorporating them into offline SFT data, SimulSA effectively bridges the
distribution gap between offline translation during pretraining and
simultaneous translation during inference. Experimental results demonstrate
that augmenting only about {\bf 1\%} of the simultaneous data, compared to the
full offline SFT data, can significantly activate LALMs' Simul-S2TT
capabilities without modifications to model architecture or decoding strategy.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel mixed training approach combining cross-lingual and monolingual techniques for Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR) in the Islamic domain, achieving promising results while emphasizing practical deployment considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between MLIR research and practical deployment by examining optimal strategies for developing ad-hoc IR systems that satisfy users' information needs across multiple languages, using the Quranic multilingual corpus as a case study.

Method: Developed eleven retrieval models using four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual, translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and monolingual techniques. Evaluated on an in-domain dataset and analyzed embedding space effects.

Result: The mixed approach achieved promising results across diverse retrieval scenarios. Analysis revealed how different training configurations affect embedding space and multilingual retrieval effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of mixed training approaches for MLIR and emphasizes the cost-efficiency of deploying a single versatile, lightweight model for real-world applications, providing practical deployment considerations.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), a
significant gap remains between research and practical deployment. Many studies
assess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to
real-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of
the Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an
ad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users'
information needs in multiple languages. We prepared eleven retrieval models
employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual,
translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and
monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that
the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval
scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different
training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for
multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment
considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single
versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications.

### [201] [CoReVLA: A Dual-Stage End-to-End Autonomous Driving Framework for Long-Tail Scenarios via Collect-and-Refine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15968)
*Shiyu Fang,Yiming Cui,Haoyang Liang,Chen Lv,Peng Hang,Jian Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoReVLA is a continual learning framework for autonomous driving that improves performance in long-tail safety-critical scenarios through a dual-stage process of data collection and behavior refinement using vision-language action models and direct preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems struggle with rare but safety-critical long-tail scenarios that contribute disproportionately to accidents. Vision-language action models have potential but are limited by lack of high-quality data and inefficient learning in such conditions.

Method: Joint fine-tuning on driving QA datasets, deployment in CAVE simulation to collect driver takeover data from long-tail scenarios, and refinement via Direct Preference Optimization to learn from human preferences and avoid reward hacking.

Result: CoReVLA achieves Driving Score of 72.18 and Success Rate of 50% on Bench2Drive benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and 15% SR in long-tail safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables continual improvement in failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences, demonstrating accurate perception and decision-making capabilities for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their
performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare
cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action
(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,
but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and
inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework
that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage
process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly
fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to
acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is
deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation
platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.
Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle
reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid
reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and
closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can
accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the
Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a
Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and
15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies
demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in
similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences. All
