Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested.

Building on this\ndataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent\nedited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel\ncomponents: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven\nedits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video\nsynthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform\nhigh-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse\ninputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier\nto generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nediting, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale\nvision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data\npoints and outperforms strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diff-In: A scalable second-order method for approximating sample influence in neural networks without convexity assumptions, achieving high accuracy with computational efficiency comparable to first-order methods.", "motivation": "Existing data analysis tools for AI model training are inaccurate and often assume convex loss functions, which doesn't hold for neural networks, making current methods challenging to implement effectively.", "method": "Proposes Diff-In formulation that approximates sample influence by accumulating differences between consecutive learning steps using second-order approximations, eliminating convexity requirements while maintaining computational efficiency through Hessian-gradient product approximation.", "result": "Theoretical analysis shows significantly lower approximation error than existing influence estimators.
