### [1] [Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender: AI Agents to fact-check YouTube videos and influence opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10577)
*Logé Cécile,Ghori Rehan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered system with two agents, Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender, to fact-check YouTube videos and engage users in comments to combat misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spreads rapidly on platforms like YouTube, threatening digital discourse. The paper aims to address this by leveraging AI for fact-checking and user engagement.

Method: Truth Sleuth extracts claims and verifies them using RAG (Wikipedia, Google Search, Google FactCheck). Trend Bender generates persuasive comments for user engagement, improving iteratively via self-evaluation.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world YouTube deployment show high fact-checking accuracy and potential to influence user perspectives.

Conclusion: The system effectively combats misinformation and fosters informed online discussions, demonstrating the promise of AI-driven interventions.

Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often
spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel
approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that
not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages
users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system
comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.
  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,
Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced
and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender
leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to
generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive
debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to
iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established
benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its
potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings
highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the
potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering
a more informed online space.

### [2] [An Offline Mobile Conversational Agent for Mental Health Support: Learning from Emotional Dialogues and Psychological Texts with Student-Centered Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10580)
*Vimaleswar A,Prabhu Nandan Sahu,Nilesh Kumar Sahu,Haroon R Lone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoSApp is an offline, smartphone-based mental health app using fine-tuned LLMs for empathetic, coherent support without internet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like accessibility, connectivity, and privacy in digital mental health support.

Method: Developed EmoSApp using fine-tuned, quantized LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on a custom mental-health QA dataset, deployed offline via Torchtune and Executorch.

Result: Qualitative evaluation showed coherent, empathetic responses; quantitative tests confirmed efficacy in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: EmoSApp exemplifies secure, portable AI-driven mental health solutions, setting a blueprint for future innovations.

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an
individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to
expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent
challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and
data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based
solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support
App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for
mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and
Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur
on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned
the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of
14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we
demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically,
maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's
mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard
commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device
deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for
future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental
health solutions.

### [3] [Transforming Sensitive Documents into Quantitative Data: An AI-Based Preprocessing Toolchain for Structured and Privacy-Conscious Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10582)
*Anders Ledberg,Anna Thalén*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A modular toolchain using open-weight LLMs processes sensitive, unstructured text (e.g., legal, medical) for embedding-based analysis, ensuring privacy and standardization. Demonstrated on Swedish court decisions, it anonymizes and summarizes documents effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large-scale analysis of sensitive, heterogeneous text data (e.g., legal, medical) while addressing privacy and structural challenges.

Method: Uses LLM prompting for standardization, summarization, and translation, plus LLM-based redaction and rule-based methods for anonymization. Validated via manual review and predictive evaluation.

Result: Successfully processes 10,842 Swedish court decisions into anonymized, standardized summaries and embeddings, retaining semantic content while removing sensitive info.

Conclusion: The toolchain facilitates privacy-conscious, large-scale text analysis, expanding research possibilities in previously inaccessible domains.

Abstract: Unstructured text from legal, medical, and administrative sources offers a
rich but underutilized resource for research in public health and the social
sciences. However, large-scale analysis is hampered by two key challenges: the
presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information, and significant
heterogeneity in structure and language. We present a modular toolchain that
prepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on
open-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a
workstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.
  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,
summarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater
comparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented
with named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of
disclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court
decisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.
Each document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and
transformed into a document-level embedding. Validation, including manual
review, automated scanning, and predictive evaluation shows the toolchain
effectively removes identifying information while retaining semantic content.
As an illustrative application, we train a predictive model using embedding
vectors derived from a small set of manually labeled summaries, demonstrating
the toolchain's capacity for semi-automated content analysis at scale.
  By enabling structured, privacy-conscious analysis of sensitive documents,
our toolchain opens new possibilities for large-scale research in domains where
textual data was previously inaccessible due to privacy and heterogeneity
constraints.

### [4] [A Taxonomy for Design and Evaluation of Prompt-Based Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10585)
*Isar Nejadgholi,Mona Omidyeganeh,Marc-Antoine Drouin,Jonathan Boisvert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an updated taxonomy for Explainable AI (XAI) focused on Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) to improve AI governance by structuring their creation, presentation, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of large language models necessitates clear NLEs for transparency, requiring a systematic approach to their design and governance.

Method: The authors develop an XAI taxonomy for NLEs across three dimensions: Context, Generation and Presentation, and Evaluation.

Result: The taxonomy offers a structured framework for stakeholders to analyze and improve NLEs in AI systems.

Conclusion: This framework aids researchers, auditors, and policymakers in enhancing transparency and governance of AI systems through better NLEs.

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to
access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models,
Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model
behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and
governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create
an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions:
(1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and
Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and
forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered
properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a
framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design,
and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

### [5] [AutoRAG-LoRA: Hallucination-Triggered Knowledge Retuning via Lightweight Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10586)
*Kaushik Dwivedi,Padmanabh Patanjali Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRAG-LoRA is a framework to reduce hallucinations in LLMs using LoRA adapters, KL-regularized training, and retrieval-augmented generation, with a feedback loop for factual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce factual inaccuracies (hallucinations), which undermine trust in real-world applications.

Method: The framework uses LoRA-based adapters, KL-regularized training, automated prompt rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and a hallucination detection module with feedback correction.

Result: AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces factual drift while maintaining model efficiency and modularity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates hallucinations in LLMs, enhancing their reliability for practical use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a
range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations -
factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present
AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that
tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based
adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt
rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in
retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both
classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to
generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop
enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We
demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while
preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

### [6] [Anthropomimetic Uncertainty: What Verbalized Uncertainty in Language Models is Missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10587)
*Dennis Ulmer,Alexandra Lorson,Ivan Titov,Christian Hardmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for LLMs to communicate uncertainty to users to enhance trust and collaboration, proposing anthropomimetic uncertainty as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide overly confident outputs, undermining trust. Effective uncertainty communication is needed for better human-machine collaboration.

Method: The paper reviews human uncertainty communication, surveys NLP research, and analyzes biases in verbalized uncertainty.

Result: Highlights overlooked biases and proposes anthropomimetic uncertainty for more authentic and personalized communication.

Conclusion: Future NLP research should focus on human-like uncertainty communication to improve trust and effectiveness in human-machine interactions.

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large
language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and
problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is
undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident
terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to
signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the
benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms.
Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means,
an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces.
Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP)
overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data
biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for
anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty
communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization
to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We
present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty
communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to
demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by
pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and
deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for
NLP.

### [7] [PLEX: Perturbation-free Local Explanations for LLM-Based Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10596)
*Yogachandran Rahulamathavan,Misbah Farooq,Varuna De Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLEX is a perturbation-free method for explainable AI in LLMs, using contextual embeddings and a Siamese network to match feature importance scores, offering faster and more efficient explanations than LIME and SHAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of LLMs makes their predictions hard to interpret, and existing XAI methods like LIME and SHAP are computationally expensive due to reliance on perturbations.

Method: PLEX leverages LLM embeddings and a Siamese network to align with feature importance scores, eliminating the need for perturbations.

Result: PLEX achieves over 92% agreement with LIME and SHAP, identifies influential words accurately, and reduces explanation time and computational overhead significantly.

Conclusion: PLEX provides an efficient and effective solution for explainable LLM-based text classification, outperforming traditional methods in speed and computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their
complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the
reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and
SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely
on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate
thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a
substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we
propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation
(PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from
the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with
feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for
subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.
We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks
(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than
92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test"
reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar
decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these
words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior
performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically
accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and
four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution
for explainable LLM-based text classification.

### [8] [Emergence of Hierarchical Emotion Organization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10599)
*Bo Zhao,Maya Okawa,Eric J. Bigelow,Rose Yu,Tomer Ullman,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Hidenori Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs form hierarchical emotion trees aligning with human psychology, with larger models showing more complexity. Biases in emotion recognition exist, especially for underrepresented groups, mirroring human social perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs model users' emotional states for ethical deployment, inspired by psychological emotion wheels.

Method: Analyzed probabilistic dependencies between emotional states in LLM outputs, comparing hierarchical structures and biases across socioeconomic personas.

Result: LLMs naturally form hierarchical emotion trees resembling human models, with larger models exhibiting more complexity. Systematic biases in emotion recognition were found, particularly for underrepresented groups.

Conclusion: LLMs internalize aspects of social perception, and cognitively-grounded theories could improve model evaluations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,
understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical
deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues
emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies
between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form
hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and
larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic
biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding
misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies
reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social
perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our
results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for
developing better model evaluations.

### [9] [Language Models for Adult Service Website Text Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10743)
*Nickolas Freeman,Thanh Nguyen,Gregory Bott,Jason Parton,Collin Francel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores language modeling for analyzing Adult Service Website (ASW) ad text to combat sex trafficking, proposing custom transformer models that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASWs are linked to sex trafficking, but analyzing their ad text is challenging due to obfuscation and poor grammar. Effective text analysis is needed to identify victims.

Method: The study evaluates various language modeling approaches, including custom transformers, and tests them on ASW text data.

Result: Custom transformer models outperform pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa in accuracy, recall, and other metrics. They also enable efficient inference on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: The custom models advance ASW text analysis, aiding tasks like graph decomposition, clustering, and emoji analysis, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an
individual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service
websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a
platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations
involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when
attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge
in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous
research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking
ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of
emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement
scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for
this application area, including simple information retrieval methods,
pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that
characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to
be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for
inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned
variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We
demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks
related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph
representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the
learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context
we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text
analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and
research.

TL;DR: The paper explores using pretrained text embedding models to enhance semantic analysis in labeled property graphs, improving tasks like node classification and relation prediction without altering the graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage rich textual attributes in property graphs for better analytical tasks by integrating pretrained text embeddings.

Method: Embed textual node and edge properties using pretrained language models and integrate them into the graph pipeline.

Result: The approach enhances accuracy and interpretability of property graph analysis by incorporating textual semantics.

Conclusion: Textual semantics from embeddings significantly improve property graph analysis without structural changes.

Abstract: Labeled property graphs often contain rich textual attributes that can
enhance analytical tasks when properly leveraged. This work explores the use of
pretrained text embedding models to enable efficient semantic analysis in such
graphs. By embedding textual node and edge properties, we support downstream
tasks including node classification and relation prediction with improved
contextual understanding. Our approach integrates language model embeddings
into the graph pipeline without altering its structure, demonstrating that
textual semantics can significantly enhance the accuracy and interpretability
of property graph analysis.

TL;DR: MISS-QA is a new benchmark for evaluating models' ability to interpret schematic diagrams in scientific papers, revealing a performance gap between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve models' comprehension of multimodal scientific literature, particularly schematic diagrams.

Method: Created a benchmark with 1,500 expert-annotated examples from 465 papers, testing 18 models on diagram interpretation and question-answering.

Result: Significant performance gap between models and humans; detailed error analysis provided insights into model limitations.

Conclusion: MISS-QA highlights current model shortcomings and offers directions for improving multimodal scientific literature comprehension.

Abstract: This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within
scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over
465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting
schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering
corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the
paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models,
including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant
performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis
of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis
further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key
insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.

### [12] [Testing Hypotheses from the Social Approval Theory of Online Hate: An Analysis of 110 Million Posts from Parler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10810)
*David M. Markowitz,Samuel Hardman Taylor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether social approval (upvotes) on hate speech posts leads to more or more extreme hate speech. Analyzing 110M Parler posts, it found no consistent positive relationship, suggesting social approval may not reinforce online hate as expected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test Walther's (2024) social approval theory of online hate, specifically whether social approval (e.g., upvotes) motivates more or more extreme hate speech.

Method: Analyzed over 110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), examining the relationship between upvotes on hate speech posts and subsequent hate speech production at various time intervals.

Result: No consistent positive relationship found; upvotes on hate speech posts did not predict more or more extreme hate speech. Between-person effects showed mixed or negative relationships.

Conclusion: Social approval may not reinforce online hate as theorized, especially on niche platforms like Parler.

Abstract: In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social
approval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's
(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social
approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as
social approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over
110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of
upvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the
amount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,
three months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average
negative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the
post level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social
approval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on
niche social media platforms.

### [13] [LLMs on Trial: Evaluating Judicial Fairness for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10852)
*Yiran Hu,Zongyue Xue,Haitao Li,Siyuan Zheng,Qingjing Chen,Shaochun Wang,Xihan Zhang,Ning Zheng,Yun Liu,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu,Charles L. A. Clarke,Weixing Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates judicial fairness in LLMs, revealing pervasive inconsistency, bias, and inaccuracy, with notable demographic biases. It introduces a framework, dataset (JudiFair), metrics, and a toolkit for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored judicial fairness of LLMs in high-stakes fields, ensuring their trustworthiness in judicial applications.

Method: Develops a framework with 65 labels and 161 values, compiles JudiFair dataset (177,100 cases), and introduces three metrics (inconsistency, bias, imbalanced inaccuracy) to evaluate 16 LLMs.

Result: LLMs exhibit severe judicial unfairness, with pronounced demographic biases. Adjusting temperature affects fairness, but model size, release date, and origin do not.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLM fairness issues and provides tools for future research to evaluate and improve fairness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields
where their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial
fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs
act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite
to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we
construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a
selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to
the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising
177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop
three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and
introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across
various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive
inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring
severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more
pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance
labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency
correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate
biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence
LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit
significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly
available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future
research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.

### [14] [How Stylistic Similarity Shapes Preferences in Dialogue Dataset with User and Third Party Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10918)
*Ikumi Numaya,Shoji Moriya,Shiki Sato,Reina Akama,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of stylistic similarity in dialogue systems, distinguishing between subjective (user-perceived) and objective (third-party annotated) similarity, and finds a strong correlation between subjective similarity and user preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work overlooks the distinction between subjective and objective stylistic similarity in dialogue systems, which may affect user impressions.

Method: A novel dataset is introduced, capturing user preferences, subjective stylistic similarity, and objective stylistic similarity in open-domain dialogues.

Result: Subjective stylistic similarity strongly correlates with user preference, and it differs from objective similarity.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to distinguish between subjective and objective evaluations in analyzing stylistic similarity's impact on user preferences.

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue generation have broadened the scope of
human-bot interactions, enabling not only contextually appropriate responses
but also the analysis of human affect and sensitivity. While prior work has
suggested that stylistic similarity between user and system may enhance user
impressions, the distinction between subjective and objective similarity is
often overlooked. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that
includes users' preferences, subjective stylistic similarity based on users'
own perceptions, and objective stylistic similarity annotated by third party
evaluators in open-domain dialogue settings. Analysis using the constructed
dataset reveals a strong positive correlation between subjective stylistic
similarity and user preference. Furthermore, our analysis suggests an important
finding: users' subjective stylistic similarity differs from third party
objective similarity. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
subjective and objective evaluations and understanding the distinct aspects
each captures when analyzing the relationship between stylistic similarity and
user preferences. The dataset presented in this paper is available online.

### [15] [HanjaBridge: Resolving Semantic Ambiguity in Korean LLMs via Hanja-Augmented Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10920)
*Seungho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HanjaBridge improves Korean LLM performance by addressing semantic ambiguity through Hanja-based meaning injection and continual pre-training, achieving a 21% boost on KoBALT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages like Korean due to linguistic challenges like homophonous Sino-Korean words.

Method: Proposes HanjaBridge, injecting all possible Hanja candidates for homographs during continual pre-training, paired with token-level knowledge distillation.

Result: 21% relative improvement on KoBALT; strong cross-lingual transfer between Korean and Chinese.

Conclusion: HanjaBridge enhances Korean understanding without runtime cost, maintaining gains even without Hanja at inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource
languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as
homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To
address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel
meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)
framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja
(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja
candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual
disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation
to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge
significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative
improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment
between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive
cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja
augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with
no additional run-time cost.

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' analogical reasoning abilities compared to humans, focusing on semantic representation and prompting for explanations, while assessing model size and architecture impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how well LLMs align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies, addressing gaps in prior research.

Method: Used a story-based analogical mapping task, analyzed semantic representations via sentence embeddings, and tested explicit prompting for explanations. Evaluated model size (8B vs. 70B) and architectures (GPT-4, LLaMA3).

Result: Assessed LLMs' ability to capture analogy similarities and dissimilarities, and the impact of prompting. Examined performance profiles at individual analogy levels.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of LLMs' analogical reasoning and their potential as models of human cognition.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer
to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models
align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research
has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack
robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the
current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a
fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human
performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in
LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity
between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity
between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the
effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we
examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in
humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and
not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our
experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)
and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as
GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical
reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for detecting depression in conversational contexts, leveraging BDI-II criteria.

Method: Adopted a prompt-engineering strategy with diverse LLMs to generate structured JSON outputs and evaluated cross-model agreement and internal consistency.

Result: Achieved DCHR = 0.50, ADODL = 0.89, and ASHR = 0.27, ranking second on the leaderboard.

Conclusion: The prompt design effectively aligned LLM outputs with BDI-II criteria, enabling analysis of conversational cues for symptom prediction.

Abstract: This Working Note summarizes the participation of the DS@GT team in two eRisk
2025 challenges. For the Pilot Task on conversational depression detection with
large language-models (LLMs), we adopted a prompt-engineering strategy in which
diverse LLMs conducted BDI-II-based assessments and produced structured JSON
outputs. Because ground-truth labels were unavailable, we evaluated cross-model
agreement and internal consistency. Our prompt design methodology aligned model
outputs with BDI-II criteria and enabled the analysis of conversational cues
that influenced the prediction of symptoms. Our best submission, second on the
official leaderboard, achieved DCHR = 0.50, ADODL = 0.89, and ASHR = 0.27.

*Zhaoyi An,Rei Kawakami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TEAM-Sign fine-tunes an LLM to treat sign language as a natural language, using stepwise prompting to bridge the gap between sign and spoken language, showing effectiveness on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language generation is complex and underutilized by LLMs despite their capabilities, prompting the need for a tailored approach.

Method: Fine-tuning an LLM with stepwise prompting to align sign and spoken language distributions and rules.

Result: Effective alignment of sign and spoken language distributions and rules on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets.

Conclusion: TEAM-Sign successfully leverages LLMs for sign language generation by treating it as a natural language and using tailored prompting.

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical LoRA adaptation method for Llama 3.1 8B to detect text-based sexism in English and Spanish tweets, achieving strong performance with minimal preprocessing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sexism detection in multilingual tweets efficiently, leveraging hierarchical subtasks and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce computational costs.

Method: Hierarchical LoRA adaptation applied to all linear transformations, with conditional adapter routing for label dependencies across subtasks (binary sexism, intention detection, multilabel categorization). Uses QLoRA 4-bit and multilingual training.

Result: Achieves competitive performance (ICM-Hard: 0.6774 binary, 0.4991 intention, 0.6519 multilabel) with 1.67% trainable parameters, 75% faster training, and 98% storage reduction.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates efficient and effective sexism detection, outperforming complex approaches while minimizing resource usage.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to EXIST 2025 Task 1, addressing text-based
sexism detection in English and Spanish tweets through hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) of Llama 3.1 8B. Our method introduces conditional adapter
routing that explicitly models label dependencies across three hierarchically
structured subtasks: binary sexism identification, source intention detection,
and multilabel sexism categorization. Unlike conventional LoRA applications
that target only attention layers, we apply adaptation to all linear
transformations, enhancing the model's capacity to capture task-specific
patterns. In contrast to complex data processing and ensemble approaches, we
show that straightforward parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves strong
performance. We train separate LoRA adapters (rank=16, QLoRA 4-bit) for each
subtask using unified multilingual training that leverages Llama 3.1's native
bilingual capabilities. The method requires minimal preprocessing and uses
standard supervised learning. Our multilingual training strategy eliminates the
need for separate language-specific models, achieving 1.7-2.4\% F1 improvements
through cross-lingual transfer. With only 1.67\% trainable parameters compared
to full fine-tuning, our approach reduces training time by 75\% and model
storage by 98\%, while achieving competitive performance across all subtasks
(ICM-Hard: 0.6774 for binary classification, 0.4991 for intention detection,
0.6519 for multilabel categorization).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces K-News-Stance, a Korean dataset for article-level stance detection, and JoA-ICL, a framework for stance detection in long-form news, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in stance detection research, which is limited to short texts and high-resource languages, and to mitigate filter bubbles and polarization in news recommendations.

Method: Proposes JoA-ICL, a journalism-guided framework using a language model agent to predict stances of key segments, aggregated for overall article stance.

Result: JoA-ICL outperforms existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness in capturing long-form article stances and promoting viewpoint diversity.

Conclusion: The work advances stance detection for long-form content and supports diverse news recommendations and media bias analysis.

Abstract: As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have
become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing
filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse
perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --
can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and
data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research
remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address
these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for
article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with
article-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal
issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided
\textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that
employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural
segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall
article stance. Experiments show that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing
stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in
capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies
further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in
news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely and accurate CVD risk stratification is crucial for reducing mortality. Unstructured clinical notes contain early indicators not captured by structured data.

Method: The study uses domain-adapted LLMs for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from free-text reports, with cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning and prompt-based inference.

Result: Evaluations show improved precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82). Challenges like contextual hallucination and temporal ambiguity are mitigated.

Conclusion: The approach highlights LLMs' potential in clinical decision support, enhancing early warning systems and translating patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing
prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical
notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel
LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language
models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from
free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning,
prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III
and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by
cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when
plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,
which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events
are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This
work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems
(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of
patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework was developed to analyze Bangla social media comments during the July Revolution in Bangladesh, achieving 83.7% accuracy with the proposed XMB-BERT and voting classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decode public opinion on social media during the July Revolution in Bangladesh, addressing the need for sentiment analysis in low-resource languages like Bangla.

Method: Used a dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments, employed transformer-based models (BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, hybrid XMB-BERT), PCA for dimensionality reduction, and tested eleven classifiers.

Result: The hybrid XMB-BERT with voting classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 83.7%, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: Machine learning techniques are effective for sentiment analysis in low-resource languages, as demonstrated by the study's success with Bangla social media data.

Abstract: The July Revolution in Bangladesh marked a significant student-led mass
uprising, uniting people across the nation to demand justice, accountability,
and systemic reform. Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying
public sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In
this study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework
to decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after
the revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected
from social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature
extraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the
proposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction
to enhance computational efficiency. We explored eleven traditional and
advanced machine learning classifiers for identifying sentiments. The proposed
hybrid XMB-BERT with the voting classifier achieved an exceptional accuracy of
83.7% and outperform other model classifier combinations. This study
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze social
sentiment in low-resource languages like Bangla.

*Andres Azqueta-Gavaldón,Joaquin Ramos Cosgrove*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve entity-matching in cross-border financial activities, outperforming traditional methods with higher accuracy and lower false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate foreign entity classification in the Spanish financial system to enhance risk management and regulatory compliance, addressing challenges like linguistic variations and outdated names.

Method: Evaluation of traditional methods (Jaccard, cosine, Levenshtein) and LLMs (Hugging Face, Microsoft Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.

Result: Traditional methods achieve >92% accuracy but have high false positives (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs achieve >93% accuracy, >96% F1 scores, and lower false positives (40-80%).

Conclusion: LLMs, especially interface-based ones, offer superior performance for entity-matching in financial systems, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets
has underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign
entities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for
ensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of
financial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching
task, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.
Challenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated
names, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms
like Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with
contextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To
address these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
flexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,
handle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional
methods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft
Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.
Results show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high
false positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving
accuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives
(40-80%).

TL;DR: DIJA is a jailbreak attack framework targeting diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs), exploiting their bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding to bypass alignment mechanisms, achieving high success rates in generating harmful completions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment mechanisms for dLLMs fail against context-aware adversarial prompts, exposing safety vulnerabilities.

Method: DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts to exploit dLLMs' bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding, bypassing alignment safeguards.

Result: DIJA outperforms prior jailbreak methods, achieving up to 100% keyword-based ASR and surpassing baselines by significant margins.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical safety gaps in dLLMs, urging a rethink of alignment strategies for this model class.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

*Sanhanat Sivapiromrat,Caiqi Zhang,Marco Basaldella,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multi-trigger data poisoning in LLMs, showing triggers can coexist without interference and remain robust. It proposes a selective retraining defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand trigger mechanisms and interactions in poisoned LLMs, addressing gaps in existing research.

Method: A framework for studying poisoning, testing trigger coexistence and robustness, and a post hoc recovery method via selective retraining.

Result: Multiple triggers can coexist robustly in LLMs, exposing a persistent vulnerability. The proposed defense removes triggers efficiently.

Conclusion: LLMs are vulnerable to multi-trigger poisoning, but selective retraining offers an effective mitigation strategy.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden
behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works
assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited
understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within
the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in
LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a
single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed
several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding
similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation
even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings
expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate
this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains
specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our
method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter
updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger
poisoning.

Motivation: To address the challenge of multilingual multimodal reasoning in educational settings, aiming for high accuracy across diverse languages.

Method: Integrated Gemini models (2.5 Flash, 1.5 Pro, 2.5 Pro) with few-shot and zero-shot prompts, conducted ablation studies, and evaluated zero-shot performance.

Result: Achieved 81.4% accuracy overall, leading 11/13 language tracks (e.g., 95.07% for Croatian). Prompt optimization boosted accuracy from 55.9% to 61.7%.

Conclusion: Lightweight OCR-VLM ensembles with precise prompts and cross-lingual augmentation outperform heavier models in multilingual educational tasks.

Abstract: We present a robust ensemble-based system for multilingual multimodal
reasoning, designed for the ImageCLEF 2025 EXAMS V challenge. Our approach
integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption
refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which
handles final answer selection, all coordinated through carefully engineered
few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study,
training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3,
Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version.
Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for
comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt
design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and
prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation
set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA)
achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and
led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07%
for Croatian and 92.12% for Italian. These findings highlight that lightweight
OCR-VLM ensembles, when paired with precise prompt strategies and cross-lingual
augmentation, can outperform heavier end-to-end models in high-stakes,
multilingual educational settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WikiMem, a dataset and method to identify and quantify personal data memorization in LLMs, aiding GDPR compliance like the Right to Be Forgotten.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs memorizing and revealing personal data, especially under GDPR's RTBF, by identifying individual-fact associations.

Method: Uses WikiMem dataset (5,000+ canaries) and a model-agnostic metric to rank ground-truth values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood.

Result: Shows memorization correlates with subject web presence and model scale, evaluated across 15 LLMs (410M-70B parameters).

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for identifying memorized personal data at the individual level, supporting dynamic forget sets for unlearning and RTBF requests.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and reveal personal information,
raising concerns regarding compliance with the EU's GDPR, particularly the
Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF). Existing machine unlearning methods assume the
data to forget is already known but do not address how to identify which
individual-fact associations are stored in the model. Privacy auditing
techniques typically operate at the population level or target a small set of
identifiers, limiting applicability to individual-level data inquiries. We
introduce WikiMem, a dataset of over 5,000 natural language canaries covering
243 human-related properties from Wikidata, and a model-agnostic metric to
quantify human-fact associations in LLMs. Our approach ranks ground-truth
values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood across
paraphrased prompts. We evaluate 200 individuals across 15 LLMs (410M-70B
parameters), showing that memorization correlates with subject web presence and
model scale. We provide a foundation for identifying memorized personal data in
LLMs at the individual level, enabling the dynamic construction of forget sets
for machine unlearning and RTBF requests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how multi-agent systems (MAS) with varied personas and temperature settings affect consensus-building and coding accuracy in qualitative research using LLMs. Results show limited benefits of MAS over single-agent coding, with only specific conditions yielding improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the benefits of multi-agent systems (MAS) over single-agent coding in qualitative research using LLMs, particularly how agent personas and temperature influence consensus and accuracy.

Method: Experimental study using six open-source LLMs (3B to 32B parameters) and 18 configurations to analyze over 77,000 coding decisions against human-annotated transcripts. MAS mirrored human coding workflows with structured discussion and consensus arbitration.

Result: Temperature impacted consensus across all LLMs. MAS with diverse personas delayed consensus in most cases, and neither temperature nor personas robustly improved accuracy. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) showed gains under specific conditions.

Conclusion: MAS with diverse personas does not consistently outperform single-agent coding, challenging assumptions about their benefits. However, MAS may help refine ambiguous code applications, suggesting potential for improving codebooks and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative
research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent
systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over
single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental
study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding
accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source
MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and
consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion
parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding
decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from
online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and
when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas
(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus
in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,
higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas
on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust
improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS
consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code
category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was
0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive
persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations
suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications
that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight
into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that
diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and
experimentation code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spanish and Catalan Bias Benchmarks (EsBBQ and CaBBQ) to evaluate social biases in LLMs, adapted from BBQ for Spain's context. Results show models struggle with ambiguous scenarios and high accuracy often aligns with bias reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of non-English and non-US social bias evaluation resources by creating Spanish and Catalan benchmarks.

Method: Develop parallel datasets (EsBBQ and CaBBQ) based on BBQ, assessing bias in 10 categories via multiple-choice QA. Evaluate LLMs by model family, size, and variant.

Result: Models often fail in ambiguous scenarios, and higher QA accuracy correlates with increased reliance on social biases.

Conclusion: The benchmarks highlight LLMs' bias issues in Spanish and Catalan, emphasizing the need for context-specific evaluations.

Abstract: Previous literature has largely shown that Large Language Models (LLMs)
perpetuate social biases learnt from their pre-training data. Given the notable
lack of resources for social bias evaluation in languages other than English,
and for social contexts outside of the United States, this paper introduces the
Spanish and the Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering (EsBBQ and
CaBBQ). Based on the original BBQ, these two parallel datasets are designed to
assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now
adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of
Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model
family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose
the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often
correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

*Fares Wael,Youssef Maklad,Ali Hamdi,Wael Elsersy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlowFSM uses LLMs with prompt chaining to extract accurate FSMs from RFC documents, outperforming existing methods in precision and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSM extraction techniques lack scalability, coverage, and clarity, especially with natural language specifications.

Method: FlowFSM combines LLMs, prompt chaining, and chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically process RFCs and construct FSMs.

Result: FlowFSM achieves high precision in FSM extraction for FTP and RTSP protocols, reducing hallucinated transitions.

Conclusion: Agent-based LLM systems like FlowFSM show promise for advancing protocol analysis and cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic
of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability
discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as
scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language
specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and
chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.
FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state
transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.
Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM
achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,
showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based
LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for
cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

*Lyzander Marciano Andrylie,Inaya Rahmanisa,Mahardika Krisna Ihsani,Alfan Farizki Wicaksono,Haryo Akbarianto Wibowo,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores language-specific features in LLMs using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces SAE-LAPE, a method to identify these features, revealing their impact on multilingual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs process multiple languages is challenging due to the polysemantic nature of neurons. The study aims to isolate language-specific features for better interpretability.

Method: The authors use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature activation probability, to identify language-specific features in LLMs.

Result: Language-specific features are found in middle to final layers, are interpretable, and influence multilingual performance. They also enable language identification comparable to fastText.

Conclusion: SAE-LAPE effectively identifies language-specific features in LLMs, enhancing interpretability and performance in multilingual tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains
challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their
polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from
cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete
and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features
are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature
activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the
feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in
the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features
influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be
used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along
with more interpretability. Our code is available at

*Luohe Shi,Zuchao Li,Lefei Zhang,Guoming Liu,Baoyuan Qi,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KV-Latent reduces Key-Value cache footprint in LLMs by down-sampling dimensions into a latent space, improving efficiency with minimal extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing Key-Value cache during inference in LLMs causes memory and bandwidth inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes KV-Latent, down-sampling KV vectors into a latent space, and modifies Rotary Positional Embedding for stability.

Result: Significantly reduces KV Cache footprint and improves inference speed with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: KV-Latent enables more efficient LLMs and opens new possibilities for KV Cache optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the
preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall
superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,
both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By
down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can
significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only
with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes.
Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on
lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,
avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position
attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query
Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we
conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing
Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the
construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new
possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces an autoformalization pipeline using large language models with error feedback to create a high-quality Olympiad-level dataset of natural language and Lean formalizations. It demonstrates the effectiveness of few-shot learning and error feedback, and validates the dataset as a benchmark for automated theorem provers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing formal mathematical reasoning by developing efficient and accurate autoformalization methods to bridge natural language and formal language datasets.

Method: Proposes an autoformalization pipeline using large language models with error feedback, curating a dataset of 3,922 natural language problems and 9,787 Lean formalizations. Evaluates the quality and benchmarks automated theorem provers.

Result: 64.46% of the dataset was rated as above-average quality. Few-shot learning, error feedback, and increased sampling improved autoformalization. The dataset proved challenging for theorem provers.

Conclusion: The autoformalization pipeline and dataset are effective for formal reasoning tasks, providing a valuable benchmark for automated theorem provers.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale
datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct
formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning.
In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language
models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free
formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level
dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The
dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$
in Lean, of which $64.46\%$ were assessed as at least above-average quality,
making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally,
we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and
empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing
sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three
automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its
challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Chinese hate speech detection by introducing a span-level dataset (STATE ToxiCN), studying coded hate terms, and proposing a lexicon-integrated method to improve detection and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of hate speech and the lack of fine-grained datasets and interpretability research in Chinese contexts motivate this work.

Method: The authors introduce a span-level dataset, study coded hate terms, and propose integrating an annotated lexicon into models.

Result: The proposed method enhances hate speech detection performance and provides insights into interpretability.

Conclusion: This work advances Chinese hate speech detection by offering resources and methods for better understanding and detecting hate speech.

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech has inflicted significant societal harm,
with its intensity and directionality closely tied to specific targets and
arguments. In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been
developed to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.
However, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and
interpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of
span-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic
understanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and
interpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex
real-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:
(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE
ToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the
hate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the
first comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to
interpret hate semantics. (3) We propose a method to integrate an annotated
lexicon into models, significantly enhancing hate speech detection performance.
Our work provides valuable resources and insights to advance the
interpretability of Chinese hate speech detection research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConVA, a method to align LLMs with human values by modifying latent representations, ensuring consistency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with human values is crucial for clarity, transparency, and adaptability in evolving scenarios.

Method: Proposes Controlled Value Vector Activation (ConVA) to interpret and modify latent value representations, using context-controlled identification and gated activation for minimal interference.

Result: Achieves highest control success rate across 10 values, maintains performance/fluency, and resists malicious inputs.

Conclusion: ConVA effectively aligns LLMs with human values, ensuring consistency and robustness.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted
increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability
to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value
Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of
LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and
modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an
accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value
vector identification method. To consistently control values without
sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation
method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that
our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values
without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even
with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are

### [38] [Automated Novelty Evaluation of Academic Paper: A Collaborative Approach Integrating Human and Large Language Model Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11330)
*Wenqing Wu,Chengzhi Zhang,Yi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating human expertise and LLM knowledge to assess novelty in academic papers, focusing on method novelty, and demonstrates superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing novelty in academic papers (expert judgment or unique reference combinations) have limitations. Human experts lack comprehensive knowledge, while the effectiveness of reference-based methods is uncertain.

Method: The approach combines human knowledge (from peer review reports) and LLM summaries of methodology sections to fine-tune PLMs. A text-guided fusion module with Sparse-Attention is designed for integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms numerous baselines in predicting method novelty.

Conclusion: The integration of human and LLM knowledge effectively addresses limitations in novelty assessment, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating
academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique
reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited
knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.
Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large
language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts
possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our
research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to
address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in
academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose
leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,
e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we
extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review
reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,
which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a
text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human
and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of
baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates nine Process Model Representations (PMRs) for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Process Modeling (PMo), introducing a new dataset and comparing PMRs on suitability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of systematic comparison among PMRs and inconsistent evaluation strategies in Process Model Generation (PMG) motivated this study.

Method: The study introduces the PMo Dataset (55 process descriptions paired with models in nine PMRs) and evaluates PMRs on suitability for LLM-based PMo and PMG performance.

Result: Mermaid scored highest overall for PMo suitability, while BPMN text performed best in PMG for process element similarity.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical insights into PMR performance, highlighting Mermaid and BPMN text as top choices for LLM-based PMo and PMG, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied for Process Modeling
(PMo) tasks such as Process Model Generation (PMG). To support these tasks,
researchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)
that serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs
differ widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been
systematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct
evaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.
This paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in
the context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset
containing 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.
We evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and
performance on PMG. \textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across
six PMo criteria, whereas \textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in
terms of process element similarity.

Motivation: Address data imbalance in multi-label emotion detection without the computational cost of traditional resampling methods.

Method: Use a dynamically adjusted weighted loss function with BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, evaluated via Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of a simple weighted loss function to
Transformer-based models for multi-label emotion detection in SemEval-2025
Shared Task 11. Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting
class weights, thereby enhancing performance on minority emotion classes
without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods. We evaluate
BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, using evaluation metrics such
as Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity coefficients.
The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk (DCR) framework to detect and quantify benchmark data contamination in LLMs, adjusting performance metrics for fairer comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs memorizing evaluation data (benchmark data contamination) inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine generalization assessment.

Method: DCR framework detects contamination at four granular levels (semantic, informational, data, label) and synthesizes scores via a fuzzy inference system to produce a unified DCR Factor.

Result: Validated on 9 LLMs, DCR reliably diagnoses contamination severity and adjusts accuracy within 4% average error compared to uncontaminated baselines.

Conclusion: DCR is a lightweight, interpretable tool for routine contamination assessment, enhancing LLM benchmarking credibility.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize
evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine
generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk
(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and
quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and
label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR
produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect
contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across
sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the
DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy
adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three
benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational
efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating
contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons
and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs) to analyze chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs, showing they mediate answers and align with model reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how chain-of-thought traces improve LLM performance in reasoning tasks.

Method: Develop CCGs from reasoning traces, compile KisMATH dataset (1671 problems), and analyze 15 LLMs.

Result: CCG nodes mediate answers, and LLMs align with CCG paths, suggesting internal reasoning structures.

Conclusion: KisMATH enables controlled interventions and further study of chain-of-thought in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large
language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on
the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more
light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed
acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model
fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of
$1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their
associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed
empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in
the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for
reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating
that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables
controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further
investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Ettin suite, paired encoder-only and decoder-only models, to fairly compare their performance on tasks like classification and generation, showing each excels in its domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of fair comparisons between encoder-only and decoder-only models due to differences in parameters, training, and datasets.

Method: Developed the Ettin suite with paired models (17M to 1B parameters) trained uniformly on up to 2T tokens, ensuring comparable conditions.

Result: Encoder-only models outperform in classification/retrieval, while decoder-only models excel in generation. Adapting models across tasks is less effective.

Conclusion: Specialized architectures (encoder/decoder) are superior for their intended tasks, and cross-adaptation underperforms. All artifacts are open-sourced for future research.

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on
decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation.
However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for
tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to
compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that
have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We
introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and
decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on
up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and
decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their
respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as
decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at
classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.
However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice
versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse
objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa
for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including
training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to
allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether prompting can control LLM reasoning strategies and evaluates its impact on problem-solving. While no single strategy consistently improves accuracy, adaptive strategy selection could enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of LLMs favoring a single reasoning strategy, which may hinder their effectiveness in diverse reasoning tasks.

Method: Investigates the impact of prompting on LLM reasoning strategies and proposes methods for adaptive strategy selection.

Result: No single strategy consistently improves accuracy, but adaptive strategy selection shows potential for performance enhancement.

Conclusion: Adaptive strategy selection can refine LLM reasoning abilities, offering new ways to improve their problem-solving effectiveness.

Abstract: Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific
problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a
single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse
reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can
control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical
problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy
consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could
adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in
strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: To create a value-aligned AI for Hong Kong, addressing its unique linguistic, cultural, and legal needs under 'one country, two systems.'

Method: Built on DeepSeek, fine-tuned for regional norms, and integrated with RAG for factual accuracy. Includes a governance-embedded approach and adversarial benchmark.

Result: HKGAI-V1 excels in culturally sensitive queries and provides a replicable model for region-specific AI.

Conclusion: The paper offers a blueprint for sovereign AI systems, emphasizing local alignment and governance.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign
large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish
value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing
the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and

framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is
built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional
norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further
integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely
and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the
design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and
safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful
development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in
handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a
"governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to
exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public
services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary
Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment
with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By
documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological
artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally
focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.

TL;DR: Simpler metrics like word overlap correlate well with human judgments in evaluating LLM-generated hotel highlights, outperforming complex methods. LLMs are unreliable for evaluation, and incorrect/non-checkable information poses risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate faithfulness of LLM-generated hotel highlights to input data and compare evaluation methods.

Method: Human evaluation campaigns with categorical error assessment and span-level annotation, comparing traditional metrics, trainable methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: Word overlap metrics correlate well with human judgments (Spearman 0.63), outperforming complex methods. LLMs are unreliable evaluators, often under- or over-annotating. Incorrect/non-checkable information poses risks.

Conclusion: Simpler metrics are effective for faithfulness evaluation, while LLMs are unreliable for this task. Challenges in crowdsourced evaluations and risks of incorrect information are highlighted.

Abstract: We examine evaluation of faithfulness to input data in the context of hotel
highlights: brief LLM-generated summaries that capture unique features of
accommodations. Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error
assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable
methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler
metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments
(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods
when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can
generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they
tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business
impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.
We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.

### [48] [CWNet: Causal Wavelet Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10689)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Yubing Lu,Mengen Cai,Zijian Zhang,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWNet introduces a causal wavelet network for low-light image enhancement, leveraging wavelet transforms and causal reasoning to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLIE methods lack instance-level semantic understanding and feature-specific adjustments. CWNet addresses this by incorporating causal reasoning and wavelet transforms.

Method: CWNet uses causal reasoning with global metric learning and local CLIP semantic loss, combined with a wavelet transform-based backbone for frequency optimization.

Result: CWNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, demonstrating robust performance in diverse scenes.

Conclusion: CWNet effectively enhances low-light images by integrating causal reasoning and wavelet transforms, offering superior performance and precision.

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

*Jiayuan Chen,Thai-Hoang Pham,Yuanlong Wang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates biological knowledge to improve microscopy image profiling for de novo cell lines by disentangling perturbation-specific and cell line-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust perturbation screening for de novo cell lines due to morphological and biological heterogeneity.

Method: Integrates external biological knowledge (protein interaction data and transcriptomic features) to disentangle representations during pretraining.

Result: Improves generalization of imaging models to de novo cell lines, validated on RxRx datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances microscopy image profiling, proving effective for phenotype-based drug discovery.

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

### [50] [Auditing Facial Emotion Recognition Datasets for Posed Expressions and Racial Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10755)
*Rina Khan,Catherine Stinson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper audits FER datasets, revealing biases in performance for spontaneous expressions and racial/skin color groups, highlighting ethical and evaluative challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance drops in FER algorithms for spontaneous expressions and racial/skin color biases, linked to dataset collection practices.

Method: Audit two FER datasets by sampling images to classify them as spontaneous or posed, and evaluate model performance across races and skin tones.

Result: Found posed images in 'in-the-wild' datasets and racial/skin color biases in FER models, leading to incorrect negative emotion predictions for non-white/dark-skinned individuals.

Conclusion: FER datasets and models exhibit biases, risking harm in real-world applications; improved data collection and model evaluation are needed.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

*Ionuţ Grigore,Călin-Adrian Popa,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new technique eliminates descriptor usage in interest point matching, reducing memory while slightly lowering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on descriptors for matching, which increases memory usage. This work aims to remove the need for descriptors.

Method: Interest points are inherently associated during detection, bypassing descriptor computation and matching.

Result: Matching accuracy is slightly lower than conventional methods, but memory usage is drastically reduced.

Conclusion: The method offers a memory-efficient alternative to descriptor-based matching, suitable for localization systems.

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset of 64k annotated spacecraft images was created for autonomous inspection, with benchmarks for YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models achieving high accuracy under real-time constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spacecraft face damage risks in outer space, and repairs are costly. Autonomous inspection systems could mitigate these issues, but lack of annotated data is a barrier.

Method: Created a dataset using real spacecraft models and synthetic backgrounds, added noise/distortion, and finetuned YOLOv8/YOLOv11 models for benchmarking.

Result: Models achieved a Dice score of 0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and inference time of ~0.5s under real-time constraints.

Conclusion: The dataset and models provide a reliable benchmark for real-time spacecraft inspection, addressing data scarcity and enabling cost-effective solutions.

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

TL;DR: A data-efficient LLM agent system is proposed for spatial reasoning in complex indoor warehouse scenarios, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with spatial understanding, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: The system integrates LLM agents with spatial reasoning tools and API interactions for complex spatial tasks.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in object retrieval, counting, and distance estimation on the AI City Challenge dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective and efficient for spatial reasoning in warehouse environments.

Abstract: Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal
Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM
finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we
present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong
and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the
challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse
scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to
conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given
complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City

*Ali Hojjat,Janek Haberer,Soren Pirk,Olaf Landsiedel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkingViT is a nested Vision Transformer (ViT) that dynamically adjusts computation based on input difficulty, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed computational budgets in Vision Transformers limit scalability and efficiency, especially for inputs of varying complexity.

Method: ThinkingViT uses progressive thinking stages and Token Recycling to dynamically activate attention heads and terminate early if predictions are certain.

Result: ThinkingViT outperforms nested baselines by up to 2.9 p.p. in accuracy on ImageNet-1K at equal computational cost.

Conclusion: ThinkingViT offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for Vision Transformers, with potential as a plugin upgrade.

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

*Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Anoop Cherian,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) for label-free, zero-shot detection by using LLMs to generate scene-specific object names, improving autonomy and adaptability in open-world object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detection requires fixed category sets and costly re-training for novel objects. Existing methods like OWOD and OVOD lack semantic labels or depend on user prompts, limiting autonomy.

Method: LAOD framework uses an LLM to generate scene-specific object names, which are passed to an open-vocabulary detector for localization. Introduces new metrics (CAAP and SNAP) to evaluate localization and naming separately.

Result: Validated on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD datasets, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel objects.

Conclusion: LAOD enhances autonomy and adaptability for open-world understanding, offering a flexible and label-free solution.

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winsor-CAM improves Grad-CAM by aggregating info across all CNN layers using Winsorization, offering tunable, interpretable saliency maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing CNN interpretability for high-stakes applications by addressing Grad-CAM's limitations in layer aggregation and noise handling.

Method: Winsor-CAM applies Winsorization to attenuate outliers and aggregates attributions across all convolutional layers with a user-tunable threshold.

Result: Outperforms Grad-CAM in interpretability and localization metrics (e.g., IoU, center-of-mass alignment) on PASCAL VOC 2012.

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM advances trustworthy AI with multi-layer insights and human-in-the-loop control.

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

*Wei Chen,Jingxi Yu,Zichen Miao,Qiang Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sparse coding-inspired fine-tuning framework for transformers improves interpretability and performance in downstream tasks like image editing and concept customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods lack interpretability in how models adapt to new tasks due to dense parameter updates.

Method: Introduces a sparse coding-based framework where fine-tuned features are sparse combinations of feature dictionary atoms, with coefficients indicating atom importance.

Result: Enhances image editing by improving text alignment and outperforms baselines in text-to-image concept customization.

Conclusion: The sparse fine-tuning framework offers interpretable and efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The method is effective for real-time clinical use, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing and model efficiency.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tracking of tubular tree structures (e.g., blood vessels) is vital for medical tasks, but existing models like Trexplorer have limitations.

Method: Trexplorer Super introduces novel advancements to enhance performance. Three datasets (one synthetic, two real) are developed for evaluation.

Result: Trexplorer Super outperforms SOTA models on all datasets, though synthetic data performance doesn't always generalize to real data.

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super advances centerline tracking, with datasets enabling robust evaluation. The code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN-based model (KAI-a) for global weather forecasting matches state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based weather models often use Transformer architectures, which are resource-intensive. This study aims to provide a more efficient alternative.

Method: KAI-a uses a scale-invariant architecture with InceptionNeXt blocks, tailored for Earth system data, and is trained on ERA5 dataset with 7M parameters.

Result: KAI-a achieves competitive accuracy in medium-range forecasting and excels in capturing extreme events like heatwaves and monsoons.

Conclusion: KAI-a offers a practical, resource-efficient solution for accurate weather forecasting, especially for extreme events.

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate

Motivation: To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization and explainability in EEG-based emotion recognition.

Method: Proposes Local Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL), incorporating bounded variation and commute-time distances in a graph theoretic framework. Introduces new evaluation metrics for temporal alignment.

Result: LVL and LGCL outperform state-of-the-art baselines on DREAMER and DEAP datasets, with LVL achieving the best aggregate rank.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a principled trade-off between interpretability and predictive power, effectively addressing TsDLI.

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

### [62] [GeoDistill: Geometry-Guided Self-Distillation for Weakly Supervised Cross-View Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10935)
*Shaowen Tong,Zimin Xia,Alexandre Alahi,Xuming He,Yujiao Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDistill is a weakly supervised framework for cross-view localization using teacher-student learning with FoV-based masking, improving accuracy and reducing uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on costly ground-truth pose annotations; GeoDistill aims to reduce this dependency by using weakly supervised learning.

Method: Uses teacher-student learning with FoV-based masking to align predictions, focusing on key features like lane lines.

Result: Significantly improves localization performance and introduces a novel orientation estimation network.

Conclusion: GeoDistill offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view localization challenges.

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

### [63] [Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10938)
*Zhengyi Xu,Haoran Wu,Wen Jiang,Jie Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GAPL-SCD, a framework for semantic change detection in remote sensing, addressing multi-task optimization challenges with adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic change detection (SCD) provides detailed 'from-to' category insights but faces challenges like negative transfer due to conflicting tasks.

Method: GAPL-SCD uses multi-task joint optimization, graph aggregation prototype learning, and adaptive weight allocation to improve performance.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets, enhancing accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD effectively addresses SCD challenges, offering improved multi-task learning and feature representation for complex scenes.

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

*Yushun Fang,Lu Liu,Xiang Gao,Qiang Hu,Ning Cao,Jianghe Cui,Gang Chen,Xiaoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIDFR is a novel ID-specific face restoration framework using diffusion models to address identity uncertainty, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face restoration methods struggle with identity uncertainty due to obscure inputs and stochastic processes.

Method: RIDFR uses a pre-trained diffusion model with two parallel conditioning modules (Content and Identity Injection) and Alignment Learning to align results.

Result: RIDFR reconstructs high-quality ID-specific results with high fidelity and robustness, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: RIDFR effectively resolves identity uncertainty in face restoration, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

*Palash Ray,Mahuya Sasmal,Asish Bera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset, WomenSports, for classifying women's sports actions using small-scale training data and proposes a CNN with channel attention for improved feature extraction, achieving 89.15% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack sufficient representation of women's sports actions with intra- and inter-class variations, limiting research in automated sports action recognition.

Method: A new dataset (WomenSports) is created, and a CNN with channel attention is proposed for deep feature extraction.

Result: The method achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy on the WomenSports dataset using ResNet-50.

Conclusion: The WomenSports dataset and proposed CNN with channel attention effectively address the gap in women's sports action classification, achieving high accuracy.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and
player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis.
Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed
WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel wavelet attention-like backbone and ray-based encoder architecture for efficient and accurate human-object interaction (HOI) detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detectors are inefficient and resource-intensive, limiting reliable predictions.

Method: Proposes a wavelet backbone for feature aggregation and a ray-based encoder for multi-scale attention.

Result: Improved performance on benchmark datasets like ImageNet and HICO-DET.

Conclusion: The architecture effectively addresses efficiency and accuracy challenges in HOI detection.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

*Ayush Gupta,Siyuan Huang,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RG-Gait proposes residual correction for occluded gait recognition, improving performance on occluded sequences without losing accuracy on holistic inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait recognition methods often ignore occlusions or require impractical paired data, and fail to retain performance on holistic inputs.

Method: Models occluded gait as a residual deviation from holistic gait, using a network to adaptively integrate the learned residual.

Result: Significantly improves occluded gait recognition on Gait3D, GREW, and BRIAR datasets while maintaining holistic accuracy.

Conclusion: Residual learning is effective for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

*Quan Bi Pay,Vishnu Monn Baskaran,Junn Yong Loo,KokSheik Wong,Simon See*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaRTAN is a lightweight CNN architecture designed to improve spatial and channel-wise information processing, achieving competitive performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CNNs and transformers, such as simplicity bias and information redundancies in MLP-like blocks.

Method: Uses kernels with varying receptive fields and a wave-based channel aggregation module to capture multi-order spatial features and reduce redundancies.

Result: Achieves 77.7% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with 3.8M parameters and 50.0% AP on COCO with 21.5M parameters.

Conclusion: SpaRTAN offers an efficient and effective design for visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

*Yuhu Bai,Jiangning Zhang,Yunkang Cao,Guangyuan Lu,Qingdong He,Xiangtai Li,Guanzhong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FiSeCLIP enhances zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) by combining feature matching and cross-modal alignment with CLIP, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) by leveraging CLIP's capabilities without additional training, while improving accuracy through feature filtering and local semantic restoration.

Method: FiSeCLIP uses batch-based testing with mutual reference images, filters noisy features using text information, and restores CLIP's local semantic correlation for fine-grained anomaly detection.

Result: FiSeCLIP achieves superior performance in anomaly classification and segmentation, outperforming AdaCLIP by +4.6%/+5.7% in AU-ROC/F1-max on MVTec-AD.

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP sets a stronger baseline for ZSAD by effectively utilizing CLIP's potential and addressing ambiguity in reference images, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

*Zeyi Hou,Zeqiang Wei,Ruixin Yan,Ning Lang,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SISRNet improves radiology report generation by focusing on medically critical regions, addressing data bias and enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods produce fluent but inaccurate reports due to data bias in radiology images.

Method: SISRNet identifies salient regions using fine-grained cross-modal semantics and focuses on them during image modeling and report generation.

Result: SISRNet outperforms peers on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Conclusion: SISRNet generates clinically accurate reports by mitigating data bias and focusing on critical regions.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

*Sung Ho Kang,Hyun-Cheol Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel CBCT-to-MDCT translation framework using Schrodinger Bridge (SB) with GAN priors and human-guided diffusion, ensuring anatomical fidelity and clinical preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve CBCT-to-MDCT translation by integrating human feedback and enforcing boundary consistency for better anatomical accuracy and clinical relevance.

Method: Combines GAN-derived priors with human-guided conditional diffusion, using classifier-free guidance (CFG) and iterative refinement with tournament-based preference selection.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics, with only 10 sampling steps, reducing artifacts while preserving detail.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and efficient for real-time, preference-aligned medical image translation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

*Sunghyun Park,Jungsoo Lee,Shubhankar Borse,Munawar Hayat,Sungha Choi,Kyuwoong Hwang,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task called personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) to recognize personal visual concepts (e.g., 'my mug cup') using text prompt tuning and negative mask proposals, while preserving original OVSS performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OVSS fails to segment regions based on personal text descriptions (e.g., 'my mug cup') among similar objects, limiting user-specific applications.

Method: Proposes a plug-in method with text prompt tuning and 'negative mask proposal' to reduce false predictions, and enhances text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of personal concepts.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on new benchmarks (FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, ADE$^\text{per}$) without compromising original OVSS capabilities.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses personalized OVSS challenges, improving segmentation for user-specific concepts while maintaining general OVSS performance.

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

*Lirong Zheng,Yanshan Li,Rui Yu,Kaihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGFDNet is a dual-domain dehazing network combining spatial and frequency domains, guided by dark channel priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models are computationally expensive for dehazing, and existing methods struggle with complex haze conditions due to weak coupling between spatial and frequency domains.

Method: Proposes DGFDNet with HAFM for adaptive frequency modulation and MGAM for multi-scale feature fusion, along with PCGB for iterative prior refinement.

Result: Achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets with robustness and real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: DGFDNet effectively addresses dehazing challenges by integrating spatial and frequency domains, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

Motivation: Accurate foot-ankle kinematics during gait is challenging due to occlusions and viewing limitations, necessitating detailed datasets like FootGait3D.

Method: FootGait3D collects 8,403 point cloud frames from 46 subjects using a five-camera system, providing complete and partial views for evaluation.

Result: The dataset supports benchmarking of 3D point cloud completion methods and advances biomechanics research.

Conclusion: FootGait3D is a valuable resource for gait analysis, prosthetic design, and robotics, available for public use.

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

### [76] [Alleviating Textual Reliance in Medical Language-guided Segmentation via Prototype-driven Semantic Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11055)
*Shuchang Ye,Usman Naseem,Mingyuan Meng,Jinman Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProLearn is a prototype-driven framework for language-guided segmentation that reduces reliance on paired image-text data, enabling broader clinical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language-guided segmentation methods depend on paired image-text data, limiting their use in datasets without reports and clinical scenarios where segmentation precedes reporting.

Method: ProLearn introduces a Prototype-driven Semantic Approximation (PSA) module to approximate semantic guidance from text, allowing segmentation without paired reports.

Result: ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets like QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+, and Kvasir-SEG when text is scarce.

Conclusion: ProLearn effectively reduces textual reliance, enhancing the practicality of language-guided segmentation in clinical settings.

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual

### [77] [Robust 3D-Masked Part-level Editing in 3D Gaussian Splatting with Regularized Score Distillation Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11061)
*Hayeon Kim,Ji Ha Jang,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoMaP is a novel framework for precise local 3D Gaussian editing, addressing challenges in inconsistent multi-view segmentations and SDS loss ambiguity. It introduces 3D-GALP for robust mask generation and a regularized SDS loss with additional constraints, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise local 3D edits are challenging due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and ambiguous SDS loss. Existing methods struggle with accuracy and flexibility in Gaussian Splatting.

Method: RoMaP combines 3D-GALP for consistent part segmentation using SH coefficients and a regularized SDS loss with L1 anchor loss (via SLaMP) and other regularizers like Gaussian prior removal.

Result: RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes, enabling robust and flexible part-level modifications.

Conclusion: RoMaP advances local 3D Gaussian editing by improving precision and flexibility, making it suitable for high-quality 3D content creation.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing
models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint angle-based method to refine human pose estimation, improving accuracy and smoothing trajectories by using high-quality datasets and a bidirectional recurrent network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HPE methods suffer from errors in keypoint recognition and trajectory fluctuations due to inaccurate manually annotated datasets.

Method: Uses joint angle-based modeling, approximates joint angle variations with Fourier series, and employs a bidirectional recurrent network for refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art HPE refinement networks, especially in challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Conclusion: Joint angle-based refinement (JAR) effectively improves HPE accuracy and trajectory smoothness.

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based keypoints network (GKNet) is proposed for accurate monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, addressing challenges like structural symmetry and occlusion. A dataset (SKD) is introduced for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High accuracy in monocular pose estimation is crucial for on-orbit service tasks, but current keypoint detectors struggle with structural symmetry and occlusion.

Method: GKNet leverages geometric constraints of keypoints graphs to improve detection. A dataset (SKD) with 90,000 simulated images is created for validation.

Result: GKNet outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint detectors in accuracy and effectiveness.

Conclusion: GKNet and the SKD dataset provide a robust solution for spacecraft pose estimation, with potential applications in satellite maintenance and debris removal.

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual RSD recognition from GPR images is labor-intensive and expertise-dependent. Deep learning's potential is hindered by dataset scarcity and network limitations.

Method: Constructed a 3D GPR dataset with 2134 samples and proposed a cross-verification strategy using YOLO models trained on different GPR scans.

Result: Achieved over 98.6% recall in RSD recognition during field tests.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces inspection labor and enhances accuracy, demonstrating practical utility in RSD detection.

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for atmospheric structure recovery rely on simplified physics and lack standardized benchmarks, leading to uncertainties and incomplete radiative transfer modeling.

Method: The authors propose Atmos-Bench, a 3D benchmark, and FourCastX, a frequency-enhanced spatio-temporal network embedding physical constraints, trained on simulated scattering volumes.

Result: FourCastX achieves consistent improvements over baselines on Atmos-Bench, excelling in both 355 nm and 532 nm bands without auxiliary inputs.

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench sets a new standard for 3D atmospheric recovery, enhancing climate understanding and forecasting.

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with fine-grained semantic information like keypoints, which are crucial for tasks like image analysis and behavior recognition.

Method: KptLLM++ uses an identify-then-detect approach with structured chain-of-thought reasoning and is trained on 500K diverse samples.

Result: The model achieves remarkable accuracy and generalization, outperforming benchmarks in keypoint detection.

Conclusion: KptLLM++ is a unified solution for fine-grained image understanding, enhancing human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Jellyfish, a diverse group of gelatinous marine organisms, play a crucial
role in maintaining marine ecosystems but pose significant challenges for
biodiversity and conservation due to their rapid proliferation and ecological
impact. Accurate identification of jellyfish species is essential for
ecological monitoring and management. In this study, we proposed a deep

underwater image dataset. The framework integrates advanced feature extraction
techniques, including MobileNetV3, ResNet50, EfficientNetV2-B0, and VGG16,
combined with seven traditional machine learning classifiers and three
Feedforward Neural Network classifiers for precise species identification.
Additionally, we activated the softmax function to directly classify jellyfish

Artificial Neural Network with MobileNetV3 is our best-performing model,
achieving an exceptional accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming other

*Hankun Liu,Yujian Zhao,Guanglin Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSGL, a multimodal framework for defining, generating, and optimizing hard samples in clothing-changing person Re-ID, improving model robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard samples in CC-ReID are ambiguous and lack explicit definitions, limiting learning strategies and model robustness.

Method: HSGL combines Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation (DGHSG) for synthesizing diverse hard samples and Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL) for hardness-aware optimization.

Result: HSGL achieves state-of-the-art performance on PRCC and LTCC datasets, accelerating convergence.

Conclusion: Multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning enhance CC-ReID robustness and discriminative capability.

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: MMOne is a framework for multimodal scene representation, addressing modality conflicts via a modality modeling module and decomposition mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance comprehension of the physical world by learning scene representations for multiple modalities, despite challenges like property and granularity disparities.

Method: Proposes MMOne with a modality modeling module and multimodal decomposition mechanism to disentangle shared and modality-specific components.

Result: Improves representation capability for each modality and scales to additional modalities.

Conclusion: MMOne effectively addresses modality conflicts, offering a compact and efficient multimodal scene representation.

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent landslide disasters due to extreme weather and human activities, coupled with challenges in large-scale observation, drive the need for automated solutions.

Method: A novel neural network architecture is designed for landslide detection and segmentation, leveraging remote sensing images as input.

Result: High F1 scores (98.23, 93.83) for detection and mIoU scores (63.74, 76.88) for segmentation on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The model shows potential for real-life landslide observation systems.

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,

proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised learning method (CMCRL) for citrus disease detection outperforms existing methods by leveraging unannotated data and hierarchical feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Citrus diseases cause significant yield losses; accurate detection is crucial but relies on costly annotated data. The paper aims to reduce dependency on labeled data while improving detection.

Method: Proposes CMCRL, combining clustering-guided contrastive learning and multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) to learn hierarchical features from unannotated data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CDD dataset (4.5%-30.1% accuracy boost) and excels in F1, precision, and recall, addressing class imbalance.

Conclusion: CMCRL offers a robust, label-efficient solution for citrus disease detection, narrowing the gap with fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the competence of VLMs in medical tasks, given their increasing use in healthcare despite underexplored performance.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of VLMs (3B to 72B parameters) across eight benchmarks, separating performance into understanding and reasoning components.

Result: General-purpose VLMs match or surpass medical-specific ones; reasoning is weaker than understanding; performance varies by benchmark.

Conclusion: No model is clinically reliable yet, highlighting the need for better multimodal alignment and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural
image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their
competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation
protocols.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCULoRA is a novel framework for incomplete multimodal learning, addressing gradient conflicts in MER by decoupling shared and distinct modality information and dynamically fine-tuning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods suffer from gradient conflicts due to incomplete modalities, degrading performance.

Method: MCULoRA uses two modules: MCLA for decoupling modality information and DPFT for dynamic parameter fine-tuning.

Result: MCULoRA outperforms previous methods in downstream task accuracy on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MCULoRA effectively improves MER performance by optimizing learning efficiency across incomplete modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

Motivation: Current benchmarks lack focus on narrative richness in long videos, limiting evaluation of models' ability to express complex narratives.

Method: Proposes TNAs to measure narrative richness, an automatic prompt generation pipeline, and an MLLM-based evaluation metric.

Result: NarrLV aligns with human judgments and reveals capability boundaries of current models in narrative expression.

Conclusion: NarrLV provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing narrative capabilities in long video generation, filling a critical gap in evaluation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long
video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to
expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long
video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

### [93] [Fairness-Aware Grouping for Continuous Sensitive Variables: Application for Debiasing Face Analysis with respect to Skin Tone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11247)
*Veronika Shilova,Emmanuel Malherbe,Giovanni Palma,Laurent Risser,Jean-Michel Loubes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fairness-based grouping method for continuous sensitive attributes to better identify discrimination in datasets, validated on synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness assessments often overlook discrimination in continuous sensitive attributes like skin color due to predefined group divisions.

Method: A novel grouping approach maximizes inter-group variance in discrimination to isolate critical subgroups, validated on synthetic and real datasets (CelebA, FFHQ).

Result: The method uncovers nuanced discrimination patterns, remains stable across datasets, and improves fairness with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations in fairness assessment for continuous attributes and shows promise for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

*Guanghao Wu,Chen Xu,Hai Song,Chong Wang,Qixing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating realistic forest fire smoke images using deep learning, addressing data scarcity and improving detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of smoke image data hinders forest fire detection. Current inpainting models lack quality in synthesizing smoke.

Method: Uses pre-trained segmentation and multimodal models for masks/captions, introduces mask-guided architecture, and a new loss function (mask random difference loss). Generates diverse smoke images with a multimodal LLM filter.

Result: Generated smoke images are realistic and diverse, enhancing forest fire smoke detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data scarcity and improves smoke detection models.

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

*Ronggang Huang,Haoxin Yang,Yan Cai,Xuemiao Xu,Huaidong Zhang,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViewSRD improves 3D visual grounding by decomposing complex queries into simpler statements and integrating multi-view textual-scene interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with disentangling targets in multi-anchor queries and handling spatial inconsistencies due to perspective variations.

Method: ViewSRD uses Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) to simplify queries, Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) for cross-modal integration, and a reasoning module for unified predictions.

Result: ViewSRD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in 3D visual grounding by leveraging structured multi-view decomposition and cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOatr, a modified YOLOv5s-based model, achieves 99.6% ATR performance on thermal infrared imagery, addressing challenges like limited datasets and domain-specific issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ATD and ATR in thermal infrared imagery face challenges like limited datasets, hardware constraints, and environmental variability, making accurate real-time detection difficult.

Method: Proposes YOLOatr, a modified YOLOv5s with optimized detection heads, feature fusion, and custom augmentation for thermal infrared ATR.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art ATR performance (99.6%) on the DSIAC MWIR dataset under varied testing protocols.

Conclusion: YOLOatr outperforms contemporary SOTA models, proving effective for real-time ATR in challenging thermal infrared scenarios.

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

Result: Models trained on TomatoMAP achieved accuracy and speed comparable to human experts, confirmed by Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement.

Conclusion: TomatoMAP enables reliable, automated fine-grained phenotyping, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Observer bias and inconsistencies in traditional plant phenotyping methods
limit the accuracy and reproducibility of fine-grained plant analysis. To
overcome these challenges, we developed TomatoMAP, a comprehensive dataset for
Solanum lycopersicum using an Internet of Things (IoT) based imaging system
with standardized data acquisition protocols. Our dataset contains 64,464 RGB
images that capture 12 different plant poses from four camera elevation angles.
Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of
interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits,
axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth
stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616
high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation
annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a
cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for
classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation.
Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to
the experts. Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement heatmap confirm the
reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces task-oriented human grasp synthesis, using task-aware contact maps to improve grasp quality and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional grasp synthesis lacks task and context awareness, limiting its practical applicability.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) constructs task-aware contact maps using scene and task info, (2) synthesizes grasps based on these maps.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in grasp quality and task performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: Task-aware contact maps enhance grasp synthesis, proving the importance of scene and task modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Motivation: Traditional methods for detecting and monitoring fluvial erosion are manual and require expertise, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: The study uses YOLOv11, fine-tuned and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, segmented and labeled via Roboflow.

Result: The approach achieves 70% accuracy in detecting erosion patterns and reliably estimates eroded areas in pixels and square meters.

Conclusion: The developed EROSCAN system automates erosion detection and quantification, aiding risk management and territorial planning.

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial
intelligence-based approach for automatic identification of eroded zones and

adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk
management and territorial planning.

*Haoxuan Qu,Yujun Cai,Hossein Rahmani,Ajay Kumar,Junsong Yuan,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Gaussian Splatting framework using multiple geometric primitives for improved surface reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GS methods use a single primitive type, limiting representation quality for complex shapes.

Method: Introduces a compositional splatting strategy, mixed-primitive initialization, and vertex pruning.

Result: Demonstrates accurate surface reconstruction in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework enhances GS by leveraging multiple primitives for better surface representation.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoMVSNet integrates monocular depth and feature priors into MVS to improve performance in challenging regions like textureless and reflective surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS methods struggle with feature matching in difficult regions, while monocular depth estimation excels there.

Method: Uses monocular features and depth, aligned via attention and dynamic candidate updates, with a relative consistency loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet effectively combines monocular and multi-view strengths for robust depth prediction.

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UGC-VideoCap, a benchmark and model framework for omnimodal captioning of user-generated videos, addressing the gap in audio-visual integration in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning benchmarks and models are visual-centric, neglecting audio's role in scene dynamics and narrative context, limiting multimodal video understanding.

Method: UGC-VideoCap includes 1000 TikTok videos with balanced audio-visual annotations and 4000 QA pairs. The proposed UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B) model uses a two-stage training strategy (supervised fine-tuning and GRPO) for efficient adaptation.

Result: The benchmark and model provide a high-quality, data-efficient solution for omnimodal video captioning in real-world UGC settings.

Conclusion: UGC-VideoCap and its model framework advance fine-grained, multimodal video understanding by integrating audio and visual modalities effectively.

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

TL;DR: The paper explores the geometric structure in face recognition embedding spaces, influenced by facial and image attributes, and introduces a physics-inspired metric to evaluate model invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the multiscale geometric structure in face recognition embeddings and assess model dependence or invariance to interpretable attributes.

Method: Proposes a geometric approach and a physics-inspired alignment metric, tested on controlled models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with synthetic data.

Result: Models show varying degrees of invariance across attributes, revealing strengths, weaknesses, and improving interpretability.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into attribute-based invariance in FR models, enhancing interpretability and understanding of their behavior.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt VAR for specific tasks like medical data generation and explore DP adaptations, which are underexplored compared to DMs.

Method: Implemented and benchmarked various adaptation strategies for VAR, comparing them to state-of-the-art DM adaptations.

Result: VAR outperforms DMs in non-DP adaptations but struggles with DP performance.

Conclusion: Further research is needed to improve DP adaptations for VAR.

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLI introduces a novel framework using Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) to improve compression of large images, addressing slow speed and suboptimal ratios in INR-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution imagery demands efficient compression, but conventional and data-driven methods struggle with detail preservation and generalizability.

Method: COLI accelerates INR-based compression via pretraining-finetuning, mixed-precision training, and parallelizable objectives, and enhances ratios with Hyper-Compression.

Result: COLI achieves better PSNR and SSIM at lower bits per pixel (bpp) and speeds up NeRV training by 4x.

Conclusion: COLI effectively addresses INR limitations, offering faster, higher-quality compression for large images.

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

TL;DR: HUG-VAS is a hierarchical NURBS generative model for vascular synthesis, combining NURBS parameterization with diffusion-based modeling to create realistic aortic geometries, outperforming traditional linear SSM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SSM methods are limited by linear assumptions, hindering their ability to model complex vascular structures like multi-branch aortas. HUG-VAS aims to overcome this by integrating NURBS and diffusion models.

Method: HUG-VAS uses a hierarchical architecture with a denoising diffusion model for centerlines and a guided diffusion model for radial profiles, trained on 21 patient-specific samples.

Result: The model generates anatomically accurate aortas with supra-aortic branches, matching biomarker distributions of the original dataset, and supports zero-shot conditional generation from image-derived priors.

Conclusion: HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to unify NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion, enabling applications like segmentation, reconstruction, and device optimization.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces COLIBRI, a fuzzy color model aligning computational color representation with human perception, validated by large-scale human experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between computational color models and human visual perception for better applications in design, AI, and marketing.

Method: A three-phase approach: identifying color stimuli, conducting a large-scale human categorization survey, and using fuzzy logic to model perceptual uncertainty.

Result: COLIBRI outperforms traditional models (RGB, HSV, LAB) in aligning with human perception, validated by data from 2496 subjects.

Conclusion: COLIBRI provides a perceptually relevant color model with adaptive capabilities, useful for diverse fields like AI and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding visual representations from noisy EEG signals is challenging but crucial for BCIs.

Method: A novel 5-stage framework involving EEG encoding, cross-modal alignment, caption refinement, weighted interpolation, and image generation.

Result: Outperforms SOTA by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy, and reduces Fréchet Inception Distance by 36.61%.

Conclusion: The framework enables high-quality, context-aware EEG-to-image generation with superior semantic alignment.

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CharaConsist improves text-to-image generation by ensuring consistent foreground and background details using point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to maintain consistent background details and struggle with identity and clothing consistency during large motion variations.

Method: CharaConsist employs point-tracking attention, adaptive token merge, and decoupled control of foreground and background.

Result: It achieves fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting continuous or discrete shots.

Conclusion: CharaConsist is the first method tailored for DiT models, producing high-quality outputs for diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

TL;DR: A streaming 4D visual geometry transformer is proposed for real-time 4D reconstruction from videos, using causal attention and implicit memory for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interactive and real-time 4D spatial-temporal geometry reconstruction from videos, addressing the challenge of processing long-term sequences efficiently.

Method: Employs a causal transformer architecture with temporal causal attention and cached historical keys/values for streaming. Knowledge is distilled from a dense bidirectional transformer (VGGT) for training.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with increased inference speed in online scenarios, enabling scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively balances real-time processing and high-quality reconstruction, advancing practical 4D vision applications.

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of traditional hardware sensors (e.g., LiDAR) and improve generalization and stability in vision-based depth estimation methods.

Method: Survey of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings.

Result: Identifies key architectures and training strategies for robust depth foundation models, leveraging large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of depth foundation models for future research and applications in 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: AGFS-Tractometry is a novel atlas-guided tractometry method for fine-scale along-tract analysis in diffusion MRI, improving sensitivity and specificity in detecting white matter differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance along-tract statistical analysis in tractometry by leveraging spatial information and permutation testing for better detection of local white matter differences.

Method: Proposes an atlas-guided tract profiling template for consistent parcellation and a nonparametric permutation testing method for group comparisons.

Result: AGFS-Tractometry outperforms AFQ and BUAN in sensitivity and specificity, identifying more anatomically consistent significant regions in real data.

Conclusion: AGFS-Tractometry effectively detects subtle or localized white matter differences, with tools and code publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo
mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an
advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to
investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber
tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract
differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this
study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely
AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation
testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.
There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel
atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,
along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a
novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable
simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for
multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets
with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry
with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract
Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the
proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in
detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,
AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which
are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these
demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially
localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and
related code are available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing public interest in NLP and LLMs, ensuring accurate and transparent communication to foster understanding and support for research.

Method: Analyzes published NLP research and popular news coverage to identify challenges (vague terminology, unrealistic expectations, ethical issues) and offers recommendations.

Result: Highlights the need for clear communication to avoid misunderstandings and sustain public support for NLP advancements.

Conclusion: Effective communication about LLMs is crucial for public understanding and continued research support, addressing terminology, expectations, and ethics.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by
rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This
attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP
researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience.
Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and
for individual researchers, this paper shares recommendations for communicating
with a general audience about LLMs' capabilities and limitations. These
recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public
understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth,
and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research
and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples.
The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the
general public about NLP, in order to strengthen public understanding and
encourage support for research.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs on the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for patent attorneys, finding none meet professional standards. GPT-4o performed best, but human experts highlighted shortcomings in clarity and rationale. The study calls for improvements in logical consistency, multimodality, and adaptive prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively assess the performance of LLMs in legal applications, specifically the EQE, and identify gaps between model capabilities and professional requirements.

Method: Evaluated open-source and proprietary LLMs (GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek, Llama-3 variants) on EQE tasks, measuring accuracy and F1 scores. Human experts assessed textual justifications.

Result: GPT-4o led with 0.82 accuracy, but no model met the 0.90 threshold for professional standards. Human experts found models lacking in clarity and legal rationale. Outputs were sensitive to temperature and prompt changes.

Conclusion: Current LLMs fall short of human-level patent proficiency. Future work should focus on logical consistency, multimodality, and adaptive prompting. Public perception of LLM performance may be overly optimistic.

Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual
applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are
underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs --
including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of
the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys.
OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web
Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama
3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for
the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have
passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold
of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are
regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level
performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3
Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the
textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each
model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the
answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert
judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt
wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future
work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive
prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the
outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might
overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a
virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific
limitations that need solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLS-DM, a model for 3D CT reconstruction from sparse 2D X-ray images, addressing latent space misalignment issues in vanilla LDM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT imaging faces challenges like high time and radiation costs. Sparse-view reconstruction is promising but struggles with latent space alignment between 2D X-ray and 3D CT data.

Method: Proposes CLS-DM, using cross-modal contrastive learning to align latent spaces and extract 3D features from 2D X-rays.

Result: CLS-DM outperforms existing models on LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets in PSNR and SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: CLS-DM improves sparse-view CT reconstruction and can generalize to other cross-modal tasks, with code made available for further research.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research

TL;DR: A novel 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR) combines deep learning, spatial-physics constraints, and optimization to accurately recover 3D current flow parameters in semiconductor packaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D information recovery is essential for non-destructive testing (NDT) to locate circuit defects in semiconductor packaging.

Method: The 3D MIR method uses a CNN to predict wire parameters, applies spatial-physics constraints for initial estimates, and optimizes parameters to match reconstructed and actual magnetic field images.

Result: The method achieves high precision in recovering 3D information, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction.

Conclusion: The 3D MIR demonstrates the potential of integrating deep learning and physics-driven optimization in practical semiconductor applications.

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

Result: Achieves 93.26% Dice score on LiTS and 87.45% on 3D-IRCADb-01, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: HANS-Net is effective and robust for anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the

Motivation: Pneumonia, especially from COVID-19, demands fast, accurate diagnosis. Automated detection using CXRs can improve outcomes.

Method: Evaluated traditional ML (PCA, Logistic Regression, SVM) and deep learning (CNNs, Vision Transformers like Cross-ViT) on 5,856 pediatric CXR images.

Result: Cross-ViT achieved 88.25% accuracy and 99.42% recall, outperforming CNNs. Architectural choices mattered more than model size.

Conclusion: Vision Transformers, particularly Cross-ViT, show promise for rapid, accurate pneumonia detection, aiding health crises.

Abstract: Pneumonia, particularly when induced by diseases like COVID-19, remains a
critical global health challenge requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. This
study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and
state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection
using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from
conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic
Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning
architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet,
DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT,
Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856
pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the
Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and
99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that
architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size,
with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also
addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training
requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical
diagnostics. Our findings suggest that Vision Transformers offer a promising
direction for automated pneumonia detection, potentially enabling more rapid
and accurate diagnosis during health crises.

*Chetan Madan,Aarjav Satia,Soumen Basu,Pankaj Gupta,Usha Dutta,Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GLCM-MAE improves medical image representation by replacing pixel-wise MSE with GLCM-based loss, enhancing texture preservation and outperforming state-of-the-art in multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MAEs using MSE loss blur textures, which are critical in medical imaging. GLCM-MAE addresses this by preserving morphological features.

Method: Proposes GLCM-MAE, a framework using GLCM-based reconstruction loss to capture intensity and spatial relationships, with a differentiable GLCM loss formulation.

Result: GLCM-MAE outperforms state-of-the-art in gallbladder cancer (2.1%), breast cancer (3.1%), pneumonia (0.5%), and COVID detection (0.6%).

Conclusion: GLCM-MAE effectively preserves texture cues in medical images, improving downstream task performance.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a dominant strategy for
self-supervised representation learning in natural images, where models are
pre-trained to reconstruct masked patches with a pixel-wise mean squared error
(MSE) between original and reconstructed RGB values as the loss. We observe
that MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural
images as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the
texture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the
strategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
feature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training
framework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM
captures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss
helps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation
to convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We
demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed
GLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms
the current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection
from ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by
3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by
0.6%. Source code and pre-trained models are available at:

TL;DR: U-RWKV is a novel framework for medical image segmentation, combining RWKV architecture with DARM and SASE modules to achieve efficient long-range modeling and high performance in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing methods like U-Net in capturing long-range dependencies due to limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), especially in resource-constrained healthcare environments.

Method: Proposes U-RWKV, leveraging RWKV architecture with Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module (DARM) and Stage-Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Module (SASE) for efficient long-range modeling and dynamic feature adaptation.

Result: U-RWKV achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: U-RWKV offers a practical, high-performance solution for medical image segmentation in resource-limited settings, democratizing advanced imaging technologies.

Abstract: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet
high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in
resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often
suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their
ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,
a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)
architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)
computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the
Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive
Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan
mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional
bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational
efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature
extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic
relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,
offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging
technologies in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-disclosure is challenging due to concerns about others' reactions. The study aims to understand how CUIs can facilitate self-disclosure through transparent social cues.

Method: The paper briefly discusses self-disclosure to CUIs and examines the role of social cues, uncertainty expressions, and reasoning representation.

Conclusion: Enhancing transparency in CUIs' social cues and reasoning can foster self-disclosure, addressing the difficulty users face in sharing personal information.

Abstract: Self-disclosure is important to help us feel better, yet is often difficult.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: MultiVox is introduced as the first benchmark to evaluate voice assistants' ability to integrate spoken and visual cues, including paralinguistic features, for multimodal understanding. Current models struggle despite human proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively assess LLMs' ability to generate context-aware responses by understanding fine-grained speech characteristics and aligning paralinguistic cues with visual signals.

Method: MultiVox includes 1000 human-annotated speech dialogues with diverse paralinguistic features and visual cues (images, videos). Nine state-of-the-art models are evaluated.

Result: Current models struggle to produce contextually grounded responses, while humans excel at the tasks.

Conclusion: MultiVox highlights the gap in multimodal understanding for voice assistants and underscores the need for improved models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered omni models
to act as voice assistants capable of understanding spoken dialogues. These
models can process multimodal inputs beyond text, such as speech and visual
data, enabling more context-aware interactions. However, current benchmarks
fall short in comprehensively evaluating how well these models generate
context-aware responses, particularly when it comes to implicitly understanding
fine-grained speech characteristics, such as pitch, emotion, timbre, and volume
or the environmental acoustic context such as background sounds. Additionally,
they inadequately assess the ability of models to align paralinguistic cues
with complementary visual signals to inform their responses. To address these
gaps, we introduce MultiVox, the first omni voice assistant benchmark designed
to evaluate the ability of voice assistants to integrate spoken and visual cues
including paralinguistic speech features for truly multimodal understanding.
Specifically, MultiVox includes 1000 human-annotated and recorded speech
dialogues that encompass diverse paralinguistic features and a range of visual
cues such as images and videos. Our evaluation on 9 state-of-the-art models
reveals that, although humans excel at these tasks, current models consistently
struggle to produce contextually grounded responses.

Conclusion: SWE-MERA provides a more reliable and dynamic benchmark for assessing LLMs in software engineering, addressing key limitations of existing datasets.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering
has revealed critical limitations in existing benchmarks, particularly the
widely used SWE-bench dataset. Recent studies have uncovered severe data
contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches
involve direct solution leakage and 31.08\% pass due to inadequate test cases.
We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to
address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of

implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing
contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300

*Mehri Mehrnia,Mohammed S. M. Elbaz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A stochastic entanglement configuration method is introduced to enhance variational quantum circuits for QML, outperforming classical models by identifying constructive entanglement topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fixed entanglement topologies in VQCs limit performance gains over classical models, necessitating adaptive strategies.

Method: A stochastic method generates diverse entanglement topologies encoded as binary matrices, evaluated using density and per-qubit constraints.

Result: 64 (16%) constructive configurations outperformed classical baselines, with ensemble accuracy reaching ~0.92 (vs. ~0.87 classical).

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robustness and generalizability, significantly improving QML performance over conventional topologies.

Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational
quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most
current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to
task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce
a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically
generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of
constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies
that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond
classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary
matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable
exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using
entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define
unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per
qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and
evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified
64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently
outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing
configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical
model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,
nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the
classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered
up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and
generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: LiLM-RDB-SFC combines Lightweight Language Models (LiLMs) with Relational Databases to enhance Deep Reinforcement Learning for efficient SFC provisioning, showing FLAN-T5 outperforms BART and SQLCoder in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for adaptable and responsive solutions in SFC and VNF placement under unpredictable network conditions, where traditional DRL methods fall short.

Method: Uses two LiLMs (BART and FLAN-T5) to interpret network data and guide DRL models, leveraging relational databases for state queries.

Result: FLAN-T5 achieves lower test loss (0.00161 vs. 0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% vs. 80.2%), and faster processing (2h 2min vs. 2h 38min) than BART. It also matches SQLCoder's accuracy while reducing processing time by 96%.

Conclusion: LiLM-RDB-SFC, particularly with FLAN-T5, offers a superior solution for efficient SFC provisioning in dynamic network environments.

Abstract: Effective management of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and optimal Virtual
Network Function (VNF) placement are critical challenges in modern
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
environments. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely adopted for
dynamic network decision-making, its inherent dependency on structured data and
fixed action rules often limits adaptability and responsiveness, particularly
under unpredictable network conditions. This paper introduces LiLM-RDB-SFC, a
novel approach combining Lightweight Language Model (LiLM) with Relational
Database (RDB) to answer network state queries to guide DRL model for efficient
SFC provisioning. Our proposed approach leverages two LiLMs, Bidirectional and
Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and the Fine-tuned Language Net T5
(FLAN-T5), to interpret network data and support diverse query types related to
SFC demands, data center resources, and VNF availability. Results demonstrate
that FLAN-T5 outperforms BART with a lower test loss (0.00161 compared to
0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% compared to 80.2%), and less processing time
(2h 2min compared to 2h 38min). Moreover, when compared to the large language
model SQLCoder, FLAN-T5 matches the accuracy of SQLCoder while cutting
processing time by 96% (SQLCoder: 54 h 43 min; FLAN-T5: 2 h 2 min).

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning training shows RL has minor in-domain gains, while SFT causes more pronounced changes and out-of-domain degradation. Freezing parts of the model yields inconclusive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning tasks, particularly their impact on in-domain and out-of-domain performance.

Method: Comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters, including parameter updates and freezing experiments.

Result: RL shows minor in-domain gains and slight out-of-domain degradation, while SFT exhibits more pronounced trends. Freezing parts of the model yields mixed results.

Conclusion: RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones, with freezing experiments providing inconclusive mitigation for out-of-domain degradation.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code
datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly
popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a
comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same
model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains
on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU,
while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters
across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights
the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer
MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the
out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of
the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with
benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together,
our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing
capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

### [130] [Domain-Adaptive Small Language Models for Structured Tax Code Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10880)
*Souvik Nath,Sumit Wadhwa,Luiz Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive small language model (SLM) with encoder-decoder architecture is proposed for accurate prediction of hierarchical tax codes like HSN or SAC, outperforming flat classifiers and other architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax compliance requires accurate determination of product and service tax codes (e.g., HSN or SAC) to avoid penalties, but current methods lack efficiency in handling hierarchical dependencies.

Method: The paper employs an encoder-decoder SLM to sequentially generate tax codes, capturing hierarchical dependencies in unstructured product and service data.

Result: The domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLM outperforms flat classifiers, decoder-only, and encoder-only architectures for structured tax code prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed SLM is effective for hierarchical tax code prediction and can be scaled to other tax commodity codes like UNSPSC or NCM.

Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of
which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often
nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC
is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes
is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive
small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the
enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we
address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using
unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon
encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes
to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our
experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied
to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains
comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat
classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and
achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only
architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also
be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United
Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura
Comum do Mercosul (NCM).

*Xingyu Zheng,Haotong Qin,Yuye Li,Jiakai Wang,Jinyang Guo,Michele Magno,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOEM is a novel PTQ method for LLMs that incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation, outperforming existing methods like GPTQ in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods assume negligible first-order terms in quantization error, but accumulated deviations make this flawed. FOEM addresses this by explicitly including first-order gradients.

Method: FOEM approximates gradients by computing differences between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding costly backpropagation. It uses precomputed Cholesky factors for efficient Hessian submatrix inversion.

Result: FOEM reduces perplexity by 89.6% for Llama3-8B and improves MMLU accuracy from 51.7% to 74.9% for Llama3-70B, nearing full-precision performance. It also integrates well with advanced techniques.

Conclusion: FOEM effectively addresses the limitations of existing PTQ methods, offering superior performance and efficiency, and can be combined with other techniques for further improvements.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing
large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and
computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods
often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,
under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained
full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation
process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights
and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally
flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly
incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error
compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference
between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited
generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach
introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages
precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian
submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models
and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical
GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of
Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from
51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.
Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as
GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging
W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision
baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AirLLM introduces a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for efficient LoRA adaptation in LLMs, combining PPO and DDIM to optimize rank configurations and reduce transmission costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of fixed or heuristic rank configurations in LoRA approaches and the high transmission costs of LoRA parameters for edge devices.

Method: AirLLM uses a PPO agent for coarse-grained decisions and DDIM for refining rank vectors, optimized alternately under CFG to align with PPO rewards.

Result: AirLLM improves fine-tuning performance and reduces transmission costs under varying signal-to-noise ratios.

Conclusion: AirLLM demonstrates scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning via reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation.

Abstract: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly
challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and
memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.
Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ
fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air
transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address
this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework
for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank
configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted
projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential
decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates
coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic
complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The
two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.
Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM
consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing
transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,
diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning
over the air.

TL;DR: FedGSCA is a novel federated learning framework designed to handle label noise and data imbalance in medical image classification, improving model robustness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise and data imbalance in federated learning for medical images degrade model performance, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: FedGSCA uses a Global Sample Selector to aggregate noise knowledge and a Client Adaptive Adjustment mechanism for dynamic adaptation to class distributions and noise handling.

Result: FedGSCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in extreme and heterogeneous noise scenarios, and improves model stability.

Conclusion: FedGSCA is effective for real-world medical federated learning, addressing noise and imbalance challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image
classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which
arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training
instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with
noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in
noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates
noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity
and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive
Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label
generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class
distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully
managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual
approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during
local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate
FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical
datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,
extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise
scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving
model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for
real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Motivation: To advance generative models by applying them to weight space learning, using optimization dynamics as structural priors for improved performance.

Method: Models gradient descent trajectories as a trajectory inference problem, unifying techniques under gradient flow matching. Includes reward fine-tuning, autoencoders, task-specific conditioning, and informative source distributions.

Result: Matches or surpasses baselines in weight generation, improves downstream training initialization, and enhances fine-tuning performance. Outperforms in detecting harmful covariate shifts.

Conclusion: The method effectively applies generative models to weight space learning, offering theoretical and practical benefits for optimization and safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success
in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language
modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by
leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from
optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory
induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several
trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching,
providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive
bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including
reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent
weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting
informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments
demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating
in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and
supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical
application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts,
where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

TL;DR: RDBP introduces ReLUDown and Decreasing Backpropagation to balance plasticity and stability in continual learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing plasticity and stability in continual learning for computer vision.

Method: Combines ReLUDown (lightweight activation modification) and Decreasing Backpropagation (gradient-scheduling scheme).

Result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods in plasticity and stability on Continual ImageNet, with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: RDBP is a practical, efficient benchmark for future continual learning strategies.

Abstract: Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a
continuous stream of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, yet existing
approaches often tip the balance heavily toward either plasticity or stability.
We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two
complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that
preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing
Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that
progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the
Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and
stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP
thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a
clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be
measured.

*Bart Pogodzinski,Christopher Wewer,Bernt Schiele,Jan Eric Lenssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spatial Reasoners is a framework for spatial reasoning using generative denoising models, simplifying research with easy-to-use interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of denoising formulations, samplers, and inference strategies makes generative reasoning research challenging.

Method: The framework provides interfaces for variable mapping, generative model paradigms, and inference strategies.

Result: Spatial Reasoners is openly available, facilitating research in generative spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework lowers the barrier for exploring generative reasoning with denoising models.

Abstract: We present Spatial Reasoners, a software framework to perform spatial
reasoning over continuous variables with generative denoising models. Denoising
generative models have become the de-facto standard for image generation, due
to their effectiveness in sampling from complex, high-dimensional
distributions. Recently, they have started being explored in the context of
reasoning over multiple continuous variables. Providing infrastructure for
generative reasoning with such models requires a high effort, due to a wide
range of different denoising formulations, samplers, and inference strategies.
Our presented framework aims to facilitate research in this area, providing
easy-to-use interfaces to control variable mapping from arbitrary data domains,
generative model paradigms, and inference strategies. Spatial Reasoners are

*Isaiah Thompson Ocansey,Ritwik Bhattacharya,Tanmay Sen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes parameter-efficient finetuning methods (LoRA and adapters) for log anomaly detection, outperforming traditional approaches with significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional log anomaly detection methods struggle with large, complex log sequences, necessitating more efficient solutions.

Method: Uses LoRA and adapter-based finetuning on tiny LLMs, tested on the Thunderbird dataset.

Result: LoRA finetuning improves accuracy by 18-19%, achieving 97.76%-98.83% compared to 79.37% with LogBert.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient finetuning, especially LoRA, is highly effective for log anomaly detection.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection using traditional rule based or deep learning based
methods is often challenging due to the large volume and highly complex nature
of log sequence. So effective way of detection of anomalous sequence of logs is
crucial for system maintenance and development. This paper proposes parameter
efficient finetuning specifically low rank adaptation (LoRA) and adapter based
approaches for finding contextual anomalies in sequence of logs in large log
data set. It compares different tiny large language models (LLMs) on the
Thunderbird dataset. The results show that LoRA based finetuning provides
substantial performance improvements of 18 to 19 percentage over LogBert based
full finetuning approach, achieving accuracy scores between 97.76% and 98.83%
compared to 79.37%.

*Christian Daniele,Silvia Villa,Samuel Vaiter,Luca Calatroni*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper extends Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) to Poisson inverse problems using a novel Mirror Descent-based DEQ formulation, outperforming traditional methods and matching Bregman Plug-and-Play without their drawbacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Poisson inverse problems, where traditional DEQs are limited to Gaussian fidelities, by introducing a non-Euclidean geometry adapted to the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Method: A novel DEQ formulation using Mirror Descent with a tailored non-Euclidean geometry, ensuring convergence and enabling efficient training and inference.

Result: The method outperforms traditional model-based approaches and matches Bregman Plug-and-Play performance while avoiding sensitivity to initialization and hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed DEQ-MD framework is effective for Poisson inverse problems, offering robust performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are implicit neural networks with fixed
points, which have recently gained attention for learning image regularization
functionals, particularly in settings involving Gaussian fidelities, where
assumptions on the forward operator ensure contractiveness of standard
(proximal) Gradient Descent operators. In this work, we extend the application
of DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more
appropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we
introduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a
tailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the
data term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled
training framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the
convergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational
strategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free
inference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional
model-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman
Plug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,
sensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/christiandaniele/DEQ-MD.

TL;DR: Elevate3D enhances low-quality 3D assets into high-quality ones using HFS-SDEdit for texture improvement and monocular geometry predictors for geometry refinement, outperforming competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D assets are scarce due to high acquisition costs, limiting applications in computer graphics and 3D vision.

Method: Elevate3D uses HFS-SDEdit for texture enhancement and alternates between texture and geometry refinement, leveraging monocular geometry predictors for accurate geometry.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D model refinement, addressing the scarcity of high-quality 3D assets.

Conclusion: Elevate3D effectively transforms low-quality 3D assets into high-quality ones, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer
graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs.
To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that
transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the
core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that
significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and
geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a
view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement.
Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our
framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by
employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures
detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced
texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art
quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of
high-quality open-source 3D assets.

TL;DR: A modular AI framework integrates multimodal agents with a reasoning orchestrator and RAG for trust-aware, zero-shot visual classification, improving accuracy by 77.94% in apple leaf disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing trust challenges in zero-shot AI settings, especially for visual and language understanding tasks.

Method: Combines generalist multimodal agents, a non-visual reasoning orchestrator, and RAG, tested in three configurations: zero-shot, fine-tuned, and trust-calibrated.

Result: Achieves 85.63% accuracy with trust-aware orchestration and RAG, with GPT-4o showing better calibration than Qwen-2.5-VL.

Conclusion: The framework enhances trust, scalability, and interpretability in multi-agent AI, applicable to diagnostics and biology, with open-source release for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent
architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing
challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot
settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual
classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a
non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three
configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)
fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated
orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.
Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator
modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy
improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,
achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL
displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with
visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via
iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision
agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable
multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other
trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components
including the complete software source code are openly released to support

*Tatiana Petrova,Aleksandr Puzikov,Boris Bliznukov,Radu State*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive evolutionary overview of the Web of Agents (WoA), linking modern protocols to historical standards and introducing a taxonomy to unify analysis. It highlights a paradigm shift in intelligence locus and calls for addressing socio-technical challenges in the WoA ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented research across communities and the lack of a holistic understanding of the WoA's trajectory motivated this study to unify historical and modern perspectives.

Method: The authors introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism) to systematically analyze and compare agent architectures across generations.

Result: The analysis reveals a paradigm shift in intelligence locus from external data or platforms to embedded agent models (LLMs), foundational for modern Agentic AI. It also identifies the need for addressing socio-technical challenges.

Conclusion: While new protocols are necessary, they are insufficient for a robust WoA ecosystem. The paper proposes a research agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance.

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,
document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'
behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become
more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across
different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered
frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation
obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic
understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive
evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and
the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations
of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To
systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic
foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery
mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing
agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent
where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift
in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic
Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model
(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable
and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new
protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,
trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies
in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda
focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance
for the emerging WoA.

Motivation: To address challenges LLMs face in inductive thematic analysis, requiring deep expertise, by testing their feasibility in replicating expert-driven thematic analysis of social media data.

Method: Evaluated five LLMs on Reddit datasets about xylazine, using binary classifications with zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting, measuring performance via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: GPT-4o with two-shot prompting achieved 90.9% accuracy and F1-score of 0.71, closely mirroring expert classifications for high-prevalence themes.

Conclusion: Few-shot LLM-based approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for qualitative research.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic
analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We
evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic
analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting
Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and
validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five
LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary
classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing
zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set,
GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score:
0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely
mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use:
16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based
approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for

*Zongtao He,Liuyi Wang,Lu Chen,Chengju Liu,Qijun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NavComposer generates high-quality navigation instructions by decomposing and recomposing semantic entities, while NavInstrCritic evaluates them without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert-provided navigation instructions are scarce, and synthesized ones often lack quality, limiting large-scale research.

Method: NavComposer decomposes semantic entities (actions, scenes, objects) and recomposes them into instructions. NavInstrCritic evaluates instructions on contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity.

Result: The framework produces rich, accurate instructions and provides a holistic evaluation, enabling scalable research.

Conclusion: The method decouples instruction generation and evaluation, making it scalable and generalizable.

Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents
to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However,
expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized
annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale
research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for
automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer
explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects,
and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular
architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while
the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy
of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting
adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.
Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive
annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on
three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic
diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction
quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on
expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from
specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable
research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the
effectiveness of our method.

*Howard H. Qian,Yiting Chen,Gaotian Wang,Podshara Chanrungmaneekul,Kaiyu Hang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces rt-RISeg, a real-time interactive perception framework for unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS), leveraging robot interactions and body frame-invariant features (BFIF) to improve generalization and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UOIS methods overfit on static visual features, leading to poor generalization in new environments. The authors propose an interactive approach inspired by the idea that vision is inherently dynamic.

Method: The rt-RISeg framework uses robot interactions to analyze BFIF, specifically relative rotational and linear velocities of body frames, to segment objects without relying on learned models. It updates masks in real-time during interactions.

Result: The method achieves a 27.5% higher segmentation accuracy than state-of-the-art UOIS techniques and can also enhance vision foundation models when used as prompts.

Conclusion: Interactive perception, as demonstrated by rt-RISeg, offers a robust solution for UOIS, outperforming traditional methods and enabling seamless integration with advanced vision models.

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

TL;DR: A Transformer-based multi-task learning framework improves social robots' decision-making in multi-user HRI, using novel loss functions and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in multi-party HRI by enabling robots to decide when and to whom to respond, unlike single-user interactions.

Method: Proposes a Transformer-based multi-task learning framework with two novel loss functions for scene modeling and response selection, validated on a new multi-party HRI dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in response decisions, outperforming heuristic-based and single-task approaches.

Conclusion: Advances socially intelligent robots for natural, context-aware multi-party interactions.

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional navigation systems fail in dynamic environments due to poor generalization. Reinforcement learning approaches also struggle with sim-to-real transfer.

Method: LE-Nav combines multi-modal LLM reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders for zero-shot scene understanding and expert-level hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Achieves human-level tuning, outperforms SOTA in success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort, with higher subjective scores for social acceptance.

Conclusion: LE-Nav effectively addresses generalization and sim-to-real challenges, enhancing robot navigation in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TRAN-D is a novel 2D Gaussian Splatting-based method for reconstructing the depth of transparent objects from RGB images, addressing challenges like reflection and refraction. It outperforms existing methods with significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent objects pose unique challenges in 3D geometry reconstruction due to properties like reflection and refraction, especially in sparse-view and dynamic scenarios.

Method: TRAN-D separates transparent objects from the background, uses an object-aware loss for artifact mitigation, and incorporates physics-based simulation for refinement.

Result: TRAN-D reduces mean absolute error by over 39% on synthetic data and achieves higher accuracy with fewer images compared to baselines.

Conclusion: TRAN-D offers a robust and efficient solution for transparent object depth reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

TL;DR: A vision-only flight control system for drones using an event camera and neural network, eliminating the need for inertial sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flight control in drones without relying on traditional inertial sensors, inspired by flying animals that use vision for attitude control.

Method: Uses a downward-facing event camera and a recurrent convolutional neural network trained via supervised learning to estimate attitude and rotation rate.

Result: Demonstrated successful flight control without inertial sensors, with performance varying based on memory, field of view, and visual cues.

Conclusion: Vision-only flight control is viable and promising for insect-scale autonomous flying robots.

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the test collection for passage retrieval and evaluate the performance of deep neural ranking models against traditional methods.

Method: Utilized expanded MS MARCO datasets for passage and document ranking, focusing on passage retrieval with inferred document labels.

Result: Deep neural models outperformed traditional methods, but dense retrieval runs were less competitive than in previous years.

Conclusion: The improved test collection and judging resources increased confidence in the dataset's quality, though unexpected outcomes emerged regarding dense retrieval performance.

Abstract: This is the fourth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous

increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we
mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage
retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document
ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were
inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to
previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our
judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of
this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish
between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in
overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs
that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they
were last year.
