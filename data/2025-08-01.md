TL;DR: The paper evaluates Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B LLMs for improving accommodation data consistency on a booking platform. Mixtral outperforms Mistral in quality but at higher computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent third-party data on booking platforms frustrates users and harms market share, prompting the need for reliable solutions.

Method: Case study integrating Mistral 7B (fine-tuned with QLoRA) and Mixtral 8x7B (refined system prompt) into CALEIDOHOTELS to assess performance in generating consistent descriptions.

Result: Mixtral 8x7B achieved higher completeness (99.6%), precision (98.8%), and lower hallucination (1.2%) than Mistral 7B, but required 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour vs. Mistral's 5GB and $0.16/hour.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, guiding LLM deployment for reliable data enhancement in production.

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

### [2] [ElectriQ: A Benchmark for Assessing the Response Capability of Large Language Models in Power Marketing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22911)
*Jinzhi Wang,Qingke Peng,Haozhou Li,Zeyuan Zeng,Qinfeng Song,Kaixuan Yang,Jiangbo Zhang,Yaoying Wang,Ruimeng Li,Biyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ElectriQ is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in electric power marketing, addressing gaps in domain expertise and empathy. It includes a dialogue dataset, evaluation metrics, and a knowledge augmentation method, showing smaller models can outperform GPT-4o when fine-tuned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems like China's 95598 hotline have slow response times and lack domain expertise. General LLMs like GPT-4o lack the required domain-specific knowledge and empathy.

Method: Introduces ElectriQ, a benchmark with a dialogue dataset, four evaluation metrics, and a knowledge augmentation method to enhance LLM performance.

Result: Fine-tuned smaller models (e.g., LLama3-8B) outperform GPT-4o in professionalism and user-friendliness.

Conclusion: ElectriQ provides a foundation for developing domain-specific LLMs for power marketing, improving service quality.

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

### [3] [A Language Model-Driven Semi-Supervised Ensemble Framework for Illicit Market Detection Across Deep/Dark Web and Social Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22912)
*Navid Yazdanjue,Morteza Rakhshaninejad,Hossein Yazdanjouei,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Mikko S. Niemela,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hierarchical framework combining fine-tuned language models and semi-supervised ensemble learning detects and classifies illicit marketplace content across platforms, outperforming baselines with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illicit trade on hidden internet platforms is hard to detect due to limited labeled data, evolving language, and platform diversity.

Method: Uses ModernBERT for semantic extraction, manual features, and a two-stage classification pipeline with ensemble learning.

Result: Achieves 0.96489 accuracy, 0.93467 F1-score, and 0.95388 TMCC, outperforming baselines like BERT and DarkBERT.

Conclusion: The framework is robust, generalizes well, and effectively detects illicit content in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

### [4] [A Hybrid Framework for Subject Analysis: Integrating Embedding-Based Regression Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22913)
*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining embedding-based ML models and LLMs improves subject analysis by guiding LLM predictions and post-editing to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject access in libraries is crucial, but traditional ML models struggle with unseen cases, and LLMs often over-generate or hallucinate.

Method: A hybrid framework uses ML models to predict the number of LCSH labels and post-edit LLM outputs to align with actual LCSH terms.

Result: The hybrid approach yields more controlled and vocabulary-aligned subject term predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating ML models with LLMs enhances subject analysis accuracy and reduces hallucinations.

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [5] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel KG integration method focusing on context matching, combining label and triple matching techniques to improve entity-matching accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG integration methods lack focus on context matching, which is crucial for real-world KGs with diverse sources and complexities.

Method: The method involves label matching (using string manipulation, fuzzy matching, vector similarity) and triple matching to align entities and predicates, enhancing entity-matching accuracy.

Result: The approach outperforms leading systems in the OAEI competition and supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the gap in context matching for KG integration, demonstrating superior performance and introducing a new dataset for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

### [6] [Theoretical Foundations and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22915)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper rigorously defines and analyzes hallucination in LLMs, distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic types. It introduces hallucination risk, derives bounds using learning theory, surveys detection and mitigation strategies, and proposes a unified workflow and evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of hallucination in LLMs by providing formal definitions, theoretical analysis, and practical solutions to improve model faithfulness.

Method: Uses learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes, Rademacher complexity) to derive hallucination risk bounds. Surveys detection (uncertainty estimation, confidence calibration) and mitigation (retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning) strategies. Proposes a unified workflow.

Result: Theoretical bounds on hallucination risk, a survey of detection/mitigation techniques, and a proposed workflow for addressing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundational theory and practical guidelines to tackle hallucination in LLMs, enhancing model reliability and factual accuracy.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [7] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a temporal-aware RAG framework to address the limitation of standard RAG in handling longitudinal queries, improving answer accuracy by 13-27%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG fails to track entities and phenomena over time due to its static retrieval methods, limiting its utility for longitudinal queries.

Method: The framework disentangles queries into subject and temporal components, using a specialized retriever to ensure temporally coherent evidence.

Result: Empirical results on the ADQAB benchmark show significant accuracy improvements over standard RAG.

Conclusion: The work advances RAG systems for nuanced, evolutionary analysis, with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

### [8] [Semantic Convergence: Investigating Shared Representations Across Scaled LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22918)
*Daniel Son,Sanjana Rathore,Andrew Rufail,Adrian Simon,Daniel Zhang,Soham Dave,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines feature universality in Gemma-2 language models of different scales, finding middle layers show strong overlap in learned features, supporting cross-model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if language models of varying scales converge on similar internal concepts, reinforcing universality for interpretability.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) pipeline to analyze residual-stream activations, aligns features via activation correlation, and compares with SVCCA and RSA.

Result: Middle layers exhibit the strongest feature overlap, while early and late layers show less similarity. Multi-token subspaces also behave similarly.

Conclusion: Large language models develop broadly similar, interpretable features regardless of size, supporting universality as a basis for cross-model interpretability.

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [9] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates methods to predict serious adverse event (SAE) outcomes in clinical trials using registration data, achieving 77.6% AUC for classification and 18.6% RMSE for regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical trial design by predicting SAE outcomes early, reducing unnecessary risks to participants.

Method: Used transfer learning with pretrained models (ClinicalT5, BioBERT) for feature extraction, combined with a sliding window approach for long texts, and downstream models for prediction.

Result: Best model achieved 77.6% AUC for classification and 18.6% RMSE for regression, with the sliding window method outperforming others.

Conclusion: ClinicalTrials.gov data is underutilized; predicting trial outcomes beforehand can enhance design and safety monitoring.

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

### [10] [Discrete Tokenization for Multimodal LLMs: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22920)
*Jindong Li,Yali Fu,Jiahong Liu,Linxiao Cao,Wei Ji,Menglin Yang,Irwin King,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of discrete tokenization methods, specifically vector quantization (VQ), for large language models (LLMs), categorizing 8 VQ variants and analyzing their principles, challenges, and applications in multimodal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of LLMs necessitates effective discrete tokenization methods, yet no systematic survey exists for VQ techniques in LLM-based systems.

Method: The paper presents a structured taxonomy of 8 VQ variants, analyzing their algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration with LLM pipelines. It also reviews applications in classical, single-modality, and multimodal LLM systems.

Result: The survey highlights challenges like codebook collapse and unstable gradient estimation, while identifying emerging research directions such as dynamic quantization and unified tokenization frameworks.

Conclusion: This work bridges traditional VQ and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for efficient multimodal systems. A continuously updated version is available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

### [11] [Fast and Accurate Contextual Knowledge Extraction Using Cascading Language Model Chains and Candidate Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22921)
*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations in language models by validating responses against candidate answers and cascading corrections through slower, more predictive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and unreliability (hallucinations) of language models by ensuring correctness and efficiency in information extraction.

Method: Propose the LMC algorithm, where responses are validated against candidate answers, and incorrect outputs are refined by slower, more predictive models in a cascade.

Result: Applied to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents, LMC significantly improved speed, accuracy, and reduced hallucinations compared to individual models.

Conclusion: The LMC algorithm is a novel contribution to knowledge extraction, warranting further exploration for broader applications.

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates if social media sentiment predicts stock movements, focusing on GameStop and AMC. It finds weak correlation between sentiment and prices, while simpler metrics like comment volume and search trends are stronger predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of online sentiment, especially from platforms like Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, on stock market movements, inspired by events like the GameStop short squeeze.

Method: Uses two existing sentiment analysis methods and introduces a ChatGPT-annotated, fine-tuned RoBERTa model to analyze informal language and emojis. Evaluates predictive power using correlation and causality metrics.

Result: Social media sentiment shows weak correlation with stock prices, while comment volume and Google search trends are stronger predictors.

Conclusion: Traditional sentiment analysis may not fully capture market-moving online discussions, highlighting the complexity of retail investor behavior.

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

### [13] [How and Where to Translate? The Impact of Translation Strategies in Cross-lingual LLM Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22923)
*Aman Gupta,Yingying Zhuang,Zhou Yu,Ziji Zhang,Anurag Beniwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates prompt translation strategies in multilingual RAG-based LLMs, showing optimized strategies improve cross-lingual knowledge sharing and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance variability in multilingual LLMs and unclear impacts of prompt translation strategies in RAG systems.

Method: Systematic evaluation of prompt translation strategies (pre-translation and cross-lingual prompting) for classification tasks in multilingual RAG-enhanced LLMs.

Result: Optimized prompting strategies significantly enhance cross-lingual knowledge sharing and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Advocates for multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization, especially for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

### [14] [Using Sentiment Analysis to Investigate Peer Feedback by Native and Non-Native English Speakers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22924)
*Brittney Exline,Melanie Duffin,Brittany Harbison,Chrissa da Gomez,David Joyner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how native vs. non-native English speaker status affects peer feedback in online U.S. CS courses, revealing differences in sentiment and ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of language background on peer feedback experiences in online graduate CS courses, given the high enrollment of international students.

Method: Analyzed sentiment of peer reviews from 500 students using the Twitter-roBERTa model, correlating sentiment scores and feedback ratings with language background.

Result: Native English speakers rated feedback less favorably; non-native speakers wrote more positively but received less positive sentiment in return. Interactions with sex and age were significant.

Conclusion: Language background modestly but complexly influences peer feedback experiences, highlighting nuanced dynamics in online learning environments.

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Motivation: Current memory mechanisms for LLM Agents lack structured organization and efficient retrieval, limiting their reasoning capabilities.

Method: H-MEM organizes memory hierarchically by semantic abstraction and uses index-based routing for efficient retrieval.

Result: The method outperforms five baselines on the LoCoMo dataset, showing effectiveness in long-term dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: H-MEM improves memory integration and retrieval, enhancing LLM Agents' reasoning and decision-making.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

### [16] [Multi-Relation Extraction in Entity Pairs using Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22926)
*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel input embedding method for document-level relation extraction, focusing on global context and multi-sentence reasoning to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture the full document context for relation extraction, as they only focus on sentences where entities appear.

Method: A new input embedding approach represents entities as standalone segments, leveraging global relationships and multi-sentence reasoning.

Result: Tested on DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL datasets, the method shows improved accuracy in predicting entity relationships.

Conclusion: The approach advances global context modeling and enhances practical NLP applications by improving relationship detection and interpretability.

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

*Zhehao Tan,Yihan Jiao,Dan Yang,Lei Liu,Jie Feng,Duolin Sun,Yue Shen,Jian Wang,Peng Wei,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark, a fine-grained benchmark to evaluate LLM-specific capabilities in RAG systems, focusing on filtering, combination, and reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook granular evaluation of LLMs in RAG systems, focusing instead on overall performance. This work aims to systematically assess LLM-specific contributions.

Method: The authors propose a placeholder-based approach to decouple LLM's parametric knowledge from external knowledge, evaluating multi-level filtering, combination, and reference reasoning.

Result: Experiments reveal limitations in LLMs' generation capabilities, especially in error resilience and context faithfulness.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a reproducible framework for improving RAG systems, highlighting areas for LLM enhancement.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

### [18] [How does Chain of Thought Think? Mechanistic Interpretability of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Sparse Autoencoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22928)
*Xi Chen,Aske Plaat,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates the faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing its effectiveness in high-capacity models like Pythia-2.8B but not in smaller ones like Pythia-70M.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if CoT-generated thoughts truly reflect the internal reasoning process of LLMs and to assess the method's faithfulness.

Method: Combining sparse autoencoders with activation patching, the study analyzes monosemantic features in Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B while solving GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain prompting.

Result: CoT-reasoning features significantly improve answer accuracy in the 2.8B model but not in the 70M model, with higher activation sparsity and interpretability in the larger model.

Conclusion: CoT induces more interpretable internal structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting method.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

### [19] [EH-Benchmark Ophthalmic Hallucination Benchmark and Agent-Driven Top-Down Traceable Reasoning Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22929)
*Xiaoyu Pan,Yang Bai,Ke Zou,Yang Zhou,Jun Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yih-Chung Tham,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark is introduced to evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ophthalmic diagnosis, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face accuracy issues due to hallucinations from limited knowledge, visual reasoning, and multimodal data, with no effective benchmarks to address these.

Method: A three-phase framework (Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, Result-Level Validation) is proposed to categorize and mitigate hallucinations.

Result: The framework significantly reduces hallucinations, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark provides a structured approach to evaluate and improve MLLMs in ophthalmology, addressing critical limitations.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

*Shalini Jangra,Suparna De,Nishanth Sastry,Saeed Fadaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset for PII-revealing text detection to address privacy risks on social platforms like Reddit, using LLMs to generate data resembling real posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reproducible research on PII privacy risks by overcoming the lack of open-source labeled datasets for risky self-disclosures.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 19 PII-revealing categories and generated synthetic data using LLMs (Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, zephyr-7b-beta) with sequential instruction prompting.

Result: The synthetic dataset meets reproducibility equivalence, unlinkability to original users, and indistinguishability from original posts.

Conclusion: The released dataset and methodology support reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

### [21] [Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931)
*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACC-RAG dynamically adjusts compression rates for RAG, improving efficiency without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed compression rates in RAG either over-compress simple queries or under-compress complex ones, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Proposes ACC-RAG, combining a hierarchical compressor and context selector to adaptively compress based on query complexity.

Result: Outperforms fixed-rate methods, achieving up to 4x faster inference while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: ACC-RAG optimizes RAG efficiency by dynamically adapting compression, balancing speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating neural networks with symbolic systems to improve visual-language understanding, addressing limitations like lack of interpretability and high resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual-language models lack interpretability, require retraining for updates, and struggle with logical reasoning. Integrating neural networks with symbolic systems offers a solution.

Method: The paper reviews techniques for enhancing visual-language understanding by combining pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with external symbolic systems.

Result: Neural-symbolic systems provide interpretable outputs, better reasoning, and the ability to integrate new information without extensive retraining.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs with symbolic systems is a promising approach to overcome limitations of current visual-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in extracting operational intelligence from confidential data using NLP and LLMs, focusing on aviation maintenance. It evaluates 16 NLP tools and LLMs, highlighting performance limitations and trust issues, and provides an open-source dataset for further testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance data confidentiality with integration for operational intelligence, especially in mission-critical industries like aviation, drives this work. Existing NLP tools struggle with domain-specific knowledge structures.

Method: The study breaks down Knowledge Graph construction into functional NLP components (NER, Coreference Resolution, etc.), evaluates 16 NLP tools and LLMs, and tests them on a baseline FAA dataset for zero-shot performance in a confidential setting.

Result: Significant performance limitations of NLP and LLM tools were observed, raising challenges for trusted applications in aviation. The paper highlights issues with Technical Readiness Level for mission-critical use.

Conclusion: Recommendations to enhance trust in NLP/LLM tools are provided, along with an open-source dataset to support future baseline testing and evaluation in similar domains.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

*Md Talha Mohsin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares five LLMs (GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, DeepSeek) on FinNLP tasks using 10-K filings, finding GPT performs best in coherence and relevance, while Gemini and DeepSeek show variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic comparisons of LLMs in financial analysis are lacking despite their growing influence, prompting this evaluation.

Method: Used domain-specific prompts and three evaluation methodologies: human annotation, automated metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics.

Result: GPT outperforms others in coherence and relevance; Claude and Perplexity follow, while Gemini and DeepSeek exhibit more variability. Performance also varies by company and prompt.

Conclusion: GPT is the most reliable for FinNLP tasks, but model performance is sensitive to prompts and source material.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoE-Ops, a collaboration-of-expert framework for AIOps, leveraging a large language model and retrieval-augmented generation to improve task routing and problem resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIOps models are limited to specific tasks due to domain constraints, while combining models can enhance performance, as shown in ensemble learning and LLM training.

Method: Proposes CoE-Ops, integrating a general-purpose LLM task classifier and retrieval-augmented generation for handling diverse AIOps tasks.

Result: CoE-Ops improves routing accuracy by 72% for high-level tasks, enhances problem resolution by 8% over single models, and outperforms MoE models by 14%.

Conclusion: CoE-Ops effectively addresses AIOps challenges by combining expert models and LLMs, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing text-based RAG systems by incorporating graph representations of flowcharts from VLMs to improve QA performance for technical documents, especially in telecom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based RAG systems struggle with QA tasks involving answers in figures like flowcharts. The goal is to bridge this gap by leveraging VLMs for graph representations.

Method: The approach involves processing technical documents, classifying image types, building graph representations using VLMs, and integrating them with text embeddings for retrieval.

Result: Graph representations from fine-tuned VLMs show lower edit distance to ground truth, and the QA system achieves good retrieval performance with text-based embeddings.

Conclusion: The method improves QA for technical documents by combining graph and text representations, reducing reliance on VLMs during inference for cost efficiency.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

Motivation: To create a privacy-unconstrained, multicentric dataset for testing NLP in radiology across languages and regions.

Method: Radiologists contributed fictional reports with metadata; a human vs. AI differentiation study was conducted.

Result: 2,658 reports in 13 languages; participants had 53.9% accuracy in distinguishing human vs. AI reports (radiologists performed better).

Conclusion: PARROT enables NLP development across linguistic and clinical boundaries without privacy issues.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)

53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,

### [30] [Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22940)
*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE is a framework to improve factual accuracy in LLMs' reasoning steps, combining fact-checking, reinforcement learning, and interpretability modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses risks of factual inaccuracies in LLMs' reasoning, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal analysis.

Method: Integrates a fact-checking classifier, GRPO reinforcement learning, and mechanistic interpretability to enhance reasoning accuracy.

Result: Improves factual robustness by up to 49.90% while maintaining performance on benchmarks like Math-500 and GPQA.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for future training methods to enhance factual robustness in LLMs.

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SigBERT is a temporal survival analysis framework for EHR data, using word embeddings and signature extraction to improve risk estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with textual data complexity in survival analysis, especially sequential clinical reports.

Method: SigBERT processes timestamped reports by averaging word embeddings into sentence embeddings, applies signature extraction for temporal dynamics, and integrates features into a LASSO-penalized Cox model.

Result: Achieved a C-index score of 0.75 on an oncology dataset, showing improved risk estimation.

Conclusion: SigBERT advances narrative-based survival analysis by effectively leveraging sequential medical data.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An expedited validation process using NLP and adaptive sampling reduces time and resources for validating claims-based algorithms, demonstrated in a case study on self-harm in obese patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of validating code-based algorithms in large claims databases, reducing the time and resource burden of manual chart reviews.

Method: Uses NLP to speed up human chart reviews and a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined stopping criteria to optimize resource use.

Result: NLP reduced review time by 40%, and adaptive sampling could have avoided 77% of chart reviews without significant loss of precision.

Conclusion: This method enables more routine validation of algorithms, improving the reliability of findings from database studies.

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

### [33] [Opacity as Authority: Arbitrariness and the Preclusion of Contestation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22944)
*Naomi Omeonga wa Kayembe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper redefines arbitrariness as a functional mechanism in human systems, extending Saussure's linguistic concept to law and social dynamics, and formalizes it using Shannon's entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conflation of arbitrariness with injustice and demonstrate its foundational role in effective system operation.

Method: Extends Saussure's 'l'arbitraire du signe' to other domains, introduces the 'Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability' chain, and formalizes arbitrariness using Shannon's entropy model.

Result: Arbitrariness is shown as a neutral, functional mechanism that protects authority and enables system operation without exposing rationale.

Conclusion: Proposes a modern theory of arbitrariness as central to control and care, with implications for AI explainability.

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

### [34] [C3: A Bilingual Benchmark for Spoken Dialogue Models Exploring Challenges in Complex Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22968)
*Chengqian Ma,Wei Tao,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset for evaluating Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) to address gaps in understanding their effectiveness in human-like conversations, compared to text-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's limited research on SDMs' practical effectiveness in emulating human conversations, especially compared to extensively benchmarked text-based LLMs. Human voice interactions are more complex due to ambiguity and context-dependency.

Method: The authors present a benchmark dataset of 1,079 instances in English and Chinese, paired with an LLM-based evaluation method aligned with human judgment.

Result: The dataset enables a comprehensive exploration of SDMs' performance in handling challenges like ambiguity and context-dependency in spoken dialogue.

Conclusion: The benchmark dataset and evaluation method aim to advance SDM development by addressing practical challenges in spoken dialogue comprehension and generation.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs can perform NLI tasks on mathematical texts (Math NLI), using human- and LLM-generated hypotheses. Findings show mixed results: LLMs sometimes match human performance but struggle with mathematical language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capability in handling NLI tasks for mathematical texts and compare human- vs. LLM-generated hypotheses.

Method: Constructed a Math NLI corpus with human-labeled premises and hypotheses, and compared LLM-generated hypotheses. Evaluated performance and inter-group consistency of LLMs.

Result: LLMs sometimes perform equivalently to humans in majority vote settings but struggle with mathematical language and basic inferences.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in Math NLI but have limitations. The provided corpus supports future research.

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

TL;DR: The paper explores using In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) without fine-tuning, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if ICL with LLMs can effectively perform FSP tasks without the need for model fine-tuning.

Method: Automatically generates task-specific prompts for Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) using FrameNet, guiding six LLMs.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL on violent event frames.

Conclusion: ICL is a practical and effective alternative to fine-tuning for domain-specific FSP tasks.

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARoPE is a dynamic, context-aware variant of RoPE that improves positional encoding in Transformers by generating head-specific frequency patterns based on token embeddings, outperforming RoPE in perplexity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE's static frequency patterns limit context-sensitive modeling, prompting the need for a dynamic, token-aware solution like CARoPE.

Method: CARoPE dynamically generates head-specific frequency patterns using token embeddings, integrating input-dependent phase shifts into the rotary mechanism.

Result: CARoPE achieves lower perplexity and faster training throughput than RoPE, especially at longer context lengths, without compromising stability.

Conclusion: CARoPE provides a scalable, efficient, and expressive upgrade to positional encoding in Transformers.

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

TL;DR: SMART-Editor is a framework for global coherence in layout and content editing across structured and unstructured domains, outperforming baselines with Reward-Refine and RewardDPO strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior models focus on local edits, lacking global coherence. SMART-Editor addresses this gap for better semantic and visual consistency.

Method: Uses Reward-Refine (inference-time refinement) and RewardDPO (training-time preference optimization) with reward-aligned layout pairs.

Result: Outperforms baselines (e.g., InstructPix2Pix, HIVE) with up to 15% gains in structured settings and advantages in natural images.

Conclusion: Reward-guided planning enhances semantic consistency and visual alignment in edits, validated by automatic and human evaluations.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling LLM-based natural language interfaces to enterprise-level data catalogs is challenging due to reliance on domain-specific fine-tuning and underutilized semantic context in metadata.

Method: Introduces a component-based retrieval architecture that decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, separately indexed for targeted retrieval, prioritizing table identification and column-level information.

Result: The method maintains high recall and accuracy, outperforming baselines on massive databases with varying structure and metadata.

Conclusion: The solution enables practical text-to-SQL systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized fine-tuning, addressing scalability gaps.

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates LLMs' handling of ambiguous Chinese text, revealing their fragility and overconfidence in interpretation, and calls for improved approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the trustworthiness of LLMs when encountering ambiguous narrative text, particularly in Chinese, and understand their limitations.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset of ambiguous sentences with disambiguated pairs, categorized into 3 main and 9 subcategories, and tested LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with ambiguity, failing to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous text, showing overconfidence, and exhibiting overthinking.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations in handling ambiguity, necessitating better approaches for real-world applications.

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

TL;DR: ISO-Bench evaluates models' ability to infer causal dependencies between visual and text steps, revealing poor performance (best F1: 0.57) and modest gains from chain-of-thought reasoning (F1: 0.62), far behind humans (F1: 0.98).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding causal relationships across modalities in real-world environments.

Method: Introduces ISO-Bench, a benchmark where models decide if a visual step occurs before or after a referenced text step.

Result: Frontier vision-language models perform poorly (best F1: 0.57), with minimal improvement from chain-of-thought reasoning (F1: 0.62), lagging behind humans (F1: 0.98).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improving causal understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies implicit user feedback from interaction logs to improve language models, finding its effectiveness depends on feedback content and prompt quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language models continuously without disruptive direct feedback by analyzing implicit feedback from user-LM interactions.

Method: Analyzed user feedback in WildChat and LMSYS datasets, studying its occurrence and harvesting learning signals from it.

Result: Feedback content (not just polarity) improves performance on short questions (MTBench) but not complex ones (WildBench). Feedback usefulness depends on prompt quality.

Conclusion: Implicit user feedback has potential but limitations, with effectiveness tied to feedback content and initial prompt quality.

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

*Jizhou Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LENS is a novel method for improving LLM ensemble performance by learning confidence from internal neural states, outperforming traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ensemble methods for LLMs rely on simplistic approaches like voting, ignoring context-dependent model confidence.

Method: LENS trains lightweight linear confidence predictors using layer-wise hidden states and normalized probabilities to weight predictions.

Result: LENS significantly outperforms traditional ensemble methods on multiple-choice and boolean QA tasks.

Conclusion: Internal representations are valuable for estimating model confidence and enhancing ensemble learning without extra computation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Motivation: The growing demand for scalable, hardware-optimized AI-generated GPU kernels drives the need for automated low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity demands.

Method: GEAK leverages cutting-edge LLMs and Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms to generate performant Triton code for AMD GPUs like MI300X and MI250.

Result: GEAK achieved 63% correctness and 2.59X speedup over baselines, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: GEAK shows promise in democratizing expert-level kernel performance and accelerating adoption of diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL methods focus on Positive samples, ignoring the potential of Negative samples to improve example selection and mitigate biases.

Method: Construct Positive and Negative sample corpora using Zero-Shot-Cot, then use semantic similarity to select and concatenate examples from both corpora for ICL demonstrations.

Result: The approach outperforms methods using only Positive samples, showing Negative samples aid in better Positive sample selection.

Conclusion: Negative samples provide valuable information for enhancing ICL performance by improving Positive sample selection.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTMs improve topic modeling by using sparse autoencoders for richer semantic features, enabling deeper themes and controllable text generation, outperforming traditional and neural baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models and neural variants struggle with semantic abstraction and expressive topic articulation due to reliance on word lists.

Method: MTMs use sparse autoencoders to learn interpretable features, defining topics over this space and enabling topic-based steering for text generation.

Result: MTMs match or exceed baselines in coherence, are preferred in evaluations, and effectively steer LLM outputs.

Conclusion: MTMs offer a more expressive and controllable approach to topic modeling, validated by improved performance and user preference.

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: TAP-GPT, a novel framework, adapts TableGPT2 for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes, outperforming general-purpose LLMs and tabular foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease requires analyzing heterogeneous biomarkers, which LLMs can address through multimodal integration and interpretability.

Method: The approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts, finetunes TableGPT2 with qLoRA adaption, and leverages its tabular understanding for clinical binary classification.

Result: TAP-GPT outperforms advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model in AD diagnosis.

Conclusion: This is the first LLM application for tabular biomarker prediction, enabling future LLM-driven biomedical informatics frameworks.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

TL;DR: The paper explores pragmatic reasoning in LLMs for mental health, introduces the P-ReMe dataset, and benchmarks models like Mistral and Qwen. It also studies stigma using StiPRompts, finding Claude-3.5-haiku most responsible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unexplored reasoning aspects of explainability and dialogue in mental health chatbots.

Method: Introduces P-ReMe dataset, defines pragmatic phenomena, formulates tasks, and benchmarks models. Also uses StiPRompts to study stigma.

Result: Mistral and Qwen excel in reasoning; Claude-3.5-haiku handles stigma better than GPT-4o mini and Deepseek-chat.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in mental health reasoning, with Claude-3.5-haiku leading in stigma handling.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates challenges in Bengali NLP, evaluates 10 LLMs on translated datasets, and identifies performance gaps and tokenization efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali is underrepresented in NLP, and its unique linguistic structure and lack of standardized benchmarks hinder progress.

Method: Evaluated 10 LLMs on 8 translated datasets, performed error analysis, and studied tokenization efficiency.

Result: Performance gaps exist for Bengali compared to English, with some models like DeepSeek showing robustness. Tokenization efficiency impacts accuracy.

Conclusion: Improved dataset quality and evaluation methods are needed for multilingual NLP. The work aims to advance research for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

*Zunhai Su,Qingyuan Li,Hao Zhang,YuLei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'Super Experts' (SEs) in MoE LLMs, a small subset of experts critical for model performance, and analyzes their unique characteristics and impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the heterogeneous importance of experts in MoE LLMs and explore the role of SEs in model performance.

Method: The study identifies SEs through their rare but extreme activation patterns, analyzes their impact via pruning experiments, and investigates their role in attention mechanisms.

Result: SEs are crucial for model performance, especially in tasks like mathematical reasoning, and their pruning disrupts attention distribution.

Conclusion: SEs play a vital role in MoE LLMs, and their discovery provides deeper insights into model mechanisms and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines GPT-4o-mini's implicit moderation of sensitive content, finding it reduces derogatory and taboo language without explicit training. It also compares LLMs' zero-shot sensitivity classification to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions, beyond known explicit moderation training.

Method: Empirical analysis of GPT-4o-mini's paraphrasing of sensitive content and evaluation of sensitivity shifts, plus zero-shot classification performance comparison.

Result: GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content toward less sensitive classes, significantly reducing derogatory and taboo language. LLMs show competitive zero-shot classification performance.

Conclusion: LLMs implicitly moderate content effectively, even without explicit training, and perform well in zero-shot sensitivity classification.

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

*Daeyong Kwon,SeungHeon Doh,Juhan Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MusT-RAG enhances LLMs for music-related tasks using a specialized RAG framework and MusWikiDB, outperforming traditional fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack music-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in music-related applications like text-only MQA tasks.

Method: Proposes MusT-RAG, a RAG-based framework with MusWikiDB for retrieval and context utilization in inference and fine-tuning.

Result: MusT-RAG outperforms fine-tuning, showing improvements in MQA benchmarks and superior performance with MusWikiDB.

Conclusion: MusT-RAG effectively adapts general-purpose LLMs for music tasks, proving the value of specialized retrieval and context integration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeQoDO is a method for autonomously building task-oriented dialogue ontologies using LLMs without supervision, outperforming transfer learning and scaling well for larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack explainability due to reliance on parametric knowledge, while traditional TOD systems require manual ontology construction. TeQoDO addresses this gap.

Method: TeQoDO uses an LLM's SQL capabilities and dialogue theory in prompts to autonomously construct TOD ontologies without supervision.

Result: TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning, scales to larger datasets, and performs competitively on dialogue state tracking.

Conclusion: TeQoDO advances LLM explainability by enabling unsupervised ontology construction, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

TL;DR: MPCC benchmark evaluates MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning, revealing significant challenges and sensitivity to constraint complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack the ability to assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities and handle complex constraints, limiting progress in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Introduces MPCC, a benchmark with real-world tasks (Flight, Calendar, Meeting Planning) and graded constraints (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to evaluate MLLMs.

Result: Closed-source models achieve 21.3% feasible plans; open-source models average below 11%, showing sensitivity to constraint complexity.

Conclusion: MPCC formalizes multimodal constraints, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and underscores the need for constraint-aware reasoning advancements.

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Causal2Vec is a decoder-only LLM-based embedding model that enhances performance without altering architecture or adding computational costs, achieving SOTA results on MTEB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for embedding models using decoder-only LLMs either remove causal attention masks, harming semantic extraction, or rely on extra input text, increasing costs.

Method: Causal2Vec uses a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode input into a Contextual token, prepended to the LLM's input. It concatenates last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens for embeddings.

Result: Achieves SOTA on MTEB, reduces sequence length by 85%, and cuts inference time by 82% compared to best methods.

Conclusion: Causal2Vec effectively improves decoder-only LLM embeddings without significant overhead, offering efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Motivation: Address concerns about data privacy, security, and equitable access in cloud-based AI translation tools.

Method: Evaluates three open-source models on CPU-based platforms, comparing them to commercial chatbots, focusing on functional performance.

Result: Local deployment offers benefits like enhanced data control and privacy, though it presents challenges.

Conclusion: Supports democratizing AI by making LLMs more accessible for individual translators and small businesses.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

TL;DR: MRGSEM-Sum is an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework using multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization to address redundancy and complex relationships, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-document summarization often use single-relational graphs and require predefined cluster numbers, limiting their ability to model rich relationships and adaptively reduce redundancy.

Method: The framework constructs a multi-relational graph for semantic and discourse relations, applies structural entropy minimization for adaptive clustering, and uses position-aware compression for summary generation.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show MRGSEM-Sum outperforms unsupervised methods and rivals supervised models and large language models in some cases. Human evaluation confirms high-quality summaries.

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum effectively addresses redundancy and relationship complexity in multi-document summarization, achieving near-human-level performance.

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

TL;DR: An enhanced Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework for Arabic NLP, featuring Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) to improve semantic relevance modeling and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic's complex morphology, optional diacritics, and dialect variations make it underrepresented in NLP research, necessitating specialized solutions.

Method: Integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and introduces ARS, an adaptive scoring function, to replace standard interaction mechanisms.

Result: Improved retrieval performance and ranking accuracy for Arabic question answering.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses Arabic NLP challenges effectively, with code publicly available for further use.

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

TL;DR: The paper introduces proactive critical thinking in AI, where models actively seek missing information to resolve queries, and presents benchmarks GSM-MC and GSM-MCE to evaluate this. Reinforcement learning improves model performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on passive critical thinking, where models reject flawed queries without constructive action. This work aims to enhance AI's ability to collaborate with users by proactively addressing incomplete or misleading data.

Method: The authors introduce GSM-MC and GSM-MCE benchmarks for assessing mathematical reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. They use reinforcement learning (RL) to improve model performance.

Result: Experiments show models struggle with proactive critical thinking, especially smaller ones. However, RL boosts Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to 73.98% on GSM-MC.

Conclusion: The work advances AI's ability to collaborate with users through proactive critical thinking, demonstrating significant improvements via RL.

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: The paper explores fine-tuning LLMs to generate role-specific responses in enterprise settings, comparing three modeling strategies and evaluating them on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety methods for LLMs lack role-specific access control, which is crucial for enterprise deployments.

Method: Three strategies are tested: BERT-based classifier, LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation, evaluated on two datasets (adapted and synthetic).

Result: Performance is assessed across organizational structures and robustness to threats like prompt injection and jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of fine-tuning LLMs for role-specific behavior, addressing a gap in enterprise safety.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CSEDB is a framework to evaluate LLMs in clinical settings, showing moderate performance with domain-specific models outperforming general ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized evaluation for LLMs in clinical decision support, ensuring safety and effectiveness.

Method: Developed CSEDB with expert consensus, tested six LLMs using 2,069 Q&A items across 26 departments.

Result: Average scores: 57.2% overall, 54.7% safety, 62.3% effectiveness; domain-specific models performed better.

Conclusion: CSEDB provides a standardized metric for LLM evaluation, aiding safer and more effective healthcare deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

*Keer Lu,Zheng Liang,Youquan Li,Jiejun Tan,Da Pan,Shusen Zhang,Guosheng Dong,Huang Leng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-R³, a medical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework using progressive reinforcement learning to jointly optimize retrieval and reasoning, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on retrieval or reasoning in isolation, lack joint optimization, and rely on supervised fine-tuning, limiting generalization. Medical domain-specific demands are also inadequately addressed.

Method: Med-R³ first develops logical reasoning, then optimizes retrieval alignment with knowledge corpus, and finally jointly optimizes retrieval-reasoning coordination via reinforcement learning.

Result: Med-R³ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R³ surpassing GPT-4o-mini by 3.93% and Qwen2.5-14B + Med-R³ gaining 13.53%.

Conclusion: Med-R³ effectively addresses the limitations of isolated optimization and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating superior performance in medical retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

*Alva West,Luodan Zhang,Liuliu Zhang,Minjun Zhu,Yixuan Weng,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T-Detect introduces a heavy-tailed discrepancy score for detecting adversarial machine-generated text, outperforming traditional Gaussian-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust detection methods for adversarial machine-generated text, as existing zero-shot detectors fail with heavy-tailed statistical artifacts.

Method: Replaces Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score from the Student's t-distribution, leveraging leptokurtosis in adversarial texts.

Result: Improves AUROC by up to 3.9%, achieving state-of-the-art performance (0.926 AUROC) on RAID's Books domain.

Conclusion: T-Detect provides a theoretically justified, robust method for detecting adversarial texts, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffLoRA introduces a parameter-efficient adaptation of differential attention with low-rank adapters, showing mixed results but notable gains in specific tasks like HumanEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the efficiency of LoRA with the performance benefits of differential attention in Transformer models.

Method: Uses low-rank adapters on both positive and negative attention terms in a differential attention mechanism.

Result: Mixed performance across NLP tasks, with a significant improvement (+11 pts) on HumanEval compared to LoRA.

Conclusion: DiffLoRA shows promise in specific domains but generally underperforms other parameter-efficient methods; attention pattern analysis provides insights.

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on detecting and masking hate speech in Arabic text using deep learning and transformers, achieving high accuracy in detection and a decent BLEU score for text cleaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing issue of hate speech in social media by developing methods to detect and clean such content in Arabic text.

Method: Used deep learning models and transformers for hate speech detection and treated text cleaning as a machine translation task.

Result: Achieved 92% Macro F1 score and 95% accuracy in detection, and a BLEU score of 0.3 for text cleaning.

Conclusion: The methods are effective for hate speech detection and masking in Arabic, with results comparable to state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Devin Wingfield,Amin Ghasemi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules in knowledge graphs, evaluating their performance on correctness and clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve KG completeness, detect errors, and enhance reasoning by making complex logical rules understandable through natural language explanations.

Method: Extracts logical rules using AMIE 3.5.1 from datasets FB15k-237, FB-CVT-REV, and FB+CVT-REV. Tests prompting strategies like zero-/few-shot and chain-of-thought reasoning. Evaluates explanations via human and automatic assessments.

Result: Promising performance in correctness and clarity, but challenges remain.

Conclusion: Large language models show potential for explaining KG rules, though further research is needed.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

*Yunxiang Yan,Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cascaded question disclosure framework to better evaluate LLMs' problem-solving capabilities, showing it provides more accurate comparisons and reduces performance gaps compared to standard QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard QA benchmarks are indirect and may overestimate performance differences between LLMs, prompting the need for a more accurate evaluation method.

Method: A cascaded question disclosure framework is introduced, revealing partial question information stagewise to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs.

Result: The framework improves model comparisons, induces better reasoning traces, and narrows performance gaps between models.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more accurate and scalable evaluation of LLMs' problem-solving abilities, challenging the indirect QA paradigm.

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for fast reconstruction and real-time rendering of urban scenes, optimizing training efficiency and visual fidelity with LOD and appearance transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in urban-scale scene reconstruction, including appearance variations and efficiency in multi-view captures.

Method: Uses scene partitioning, visibility-based image selection, controllable LOD, appearance transformation, and enhancement modules like depth regularization.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in efficiency and quality for urban-scale scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances speed, robustness, and visual fidelity in large-scale scene rendering.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff combines diffusion models and Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic human gaze scanpaths, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for scanpath prediction often fail to capture the variability of human visual exploration, limiting their realism and applicability.

Method: ScanDiff integrates diffusion models with Vision Transformers to model scanpath variability and includes textual conditioning for task-driven generation.

Result: ScanDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths.

Conclusion: ScanDiff advances gaze prediction research by better capturing human visual behavior complexity, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) improves classification accuracy on low-quality echocardiograms, with SRResNet showing significant performance gains and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor-quality echocardiographic imaging in resource-constrained settings limits diagnostic model effectiveness, prompting exploration of SR techniques for enhancement.

Method: Applied SRGAN and SRResNet to enhance low-quality 2D echocardiograms from the CAMUS dataset, evaluating performance on view (2CH vs. 4CH) and phase (ED vs. ES) classification tasks.

Result: SRResNet notably improved classification accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating SR's potential to recover diagnostic value in degraded scans.

Conclusion: SR, particularly SRResNet, is viable for enhancing echocardiograms in resource-constrained settings, enabling more effective AI-assisted care.

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spike-based NeRF framework (PATA) is proposed to reduce computational costs in 3D rendering by dynamically adjusting time steps, preserving quality while cutting inference time and power usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF models are computationally expensive, limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios. SNNs offer energy efficiency, motivating a hybrid approach.

Method: PATA integrates SNNs with NeRF, using dynamic time-step adjustment during training to balance rendering quality and efficiency.

Result: PATA reduces inference time steps by 64% and power by 61.55% while maintaining rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: PATA effectively addresses computational inefficiency in NeRF models, making them viable for edge computing.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [73] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive is a vision-language architecture for autonomous vehicles, combining front-camera images, HD maps, LiDAR depth, and waypoints in a single branch with cross-attention and smoothness loss, achieving higher success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need rapid, precise reactions to complex road conditions and traffic intent, requiring efficient and accurate processing of multimodal data.

Method: NovaDrive uses a single-branch architecture with two-stage cross-attention for aligning waypoints with HD maps and refining attention over image/depth patches, plus a smoothness loss to avoid abrupt changes. It fine-tunes a vision-language backbone for real-time inference.

Result: NovaDrive improves success rate to 84% (+4%), path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collisions from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) on benchmarks.

Conclusion: NovaDrive enhances safety and efficiency, with potential for broader embodied-AI applications and reduced energy consumption due to optimized routes.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MObI and AnydoorMed, two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical imaging, leveraging diffusion models for realistic and controllable inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for realistic and controllable synthetic data in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging, where real-world data collection is costly and complex.

Method: MObI uses a diffusion model for multimodal object inpainting, ensuring semantic consistency and coherence. AnydoorMed applies a similar approach for medical imaging, focusing on anomaly inpainting with detail preservation.

Result: Both methods demonstrate successful adaptation of foundation models for reference-guided inpainting across diverse modalities, enabling highly realistic and controllable synthetic scenarios.

Conclusion: The work shows that diffusion-based models can be effectively adapted for multimodal synthetic data generation, advancing the field of realistic and controllable counterfactual scenarios.

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be

### [75] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive integrates vision, map, and waypoint data using a goal-centered cross-attention layer and a fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 model, achieving high success rates and efficiency in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous cars require both geometric accuracy and semantic understanding, but existing systems often handle these separately. XYZ-Drive aims to unify these aspects for better performance.

Method: XYZ-Drive uses a vision-language model with a goal-centered cross-attention layer to fuse front-camera frames, overhead maps, and waypoints. It outputs steering and speed via a fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.

Result: Achieves 95% success and 0.80 SPL on the MD-NEX benchmark, outperforming PhysNav-DG by 15% and reducing collisions. Ablations confirm the importance of each modality and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Early token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, and real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-FineR is a training-free method for fine-grained image classification, leveraging LLMs and VLMs for open-set recognition without predefined labels, achieving SOTA results and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for fine-grained classification rely on fixed vocabularies and closed-set paradigms, limiting scalability and adaptability to novel classes in real-world settings.

Method: Proposes E-FineR, a training-free framework combining LLMs and VLMs for open-set recognition, eliminating the need for predefined class labels and expert annotations.

Result: E-FineR achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained recognition, with strong interpretability and applicability to zero-shot and few-shot classification.

Conclusion: E-FineR enables flexible, language-driven image classification, scalable for real-world applications without human intervention, and is open-sourced.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) method combines complementary concepts, refining them to address key challenges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OV-3DIS approaches use vision-language models (VLMs) but lack integration of complementary concepts. This paper aims to unify and refine these concepts for better performance.

Method: The two-stage approach includes 3D proposal generation (using tracking-based aggregation and iterative merging/removal) and instance classification (using Alpha-CLIP for object-centric representation and SMS score for similarity normalization).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS, surpassing even closed-vocabulary methods in AP and AR metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines and refines existing concepts, demonstrating superior performance in OV-3DIS.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo is a zero-shot diffusion-based method for animating static portraits using facial movements from a driving video, addressing identity leakage and expression capture issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches suffer from identity leakage and struggle with subtle/extreme expressions. X-NeMo aims to overcome these by introducing a novel training framework.

Method: Uses a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor, cross-attention for motion control, and a dual GAN decoder for disentanglement. Trained end-to-end without pretrained detectors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, producing expressive animations with better identity resemblance.

Conclusion: X-NeMo effectively mitigates identity leakage and captures detailed facial motion, offering a robust solution for portrait animation.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural inverse rendering method jointly reconstructs geometry, reflectance, and lighting from multi-view images without light calibration or intermediate cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify multi-view photometric stereo by eliminating the need for light calibration or intermediate normal maps, enabling joint optimization of all scene parameters.

Method: Uses neural implicit fields for geometry and reflectance, shadow-aware volume rendering, and spatial and reflectance networks to predict scene properties.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in shape and lighting accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned images, and handles complex objects.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances inverse rendering by jointly optimizing scene parameters and handling challenging cases effectively.

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

TL;DR: A novel image restoration network using Corner Loss and R-CBAM for rain streak removal, outperforming previous methods on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving fine structural details and visual quality in single-image rain streak removal, beyond simple noise suppression.

Method: Introduces Corner Loss to prevent boundary and texture loss, and R-CBAM Block for dynamic feature importance adjustment in spatial and channel dimensions.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 33.29 dB on Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively removes rain streaks while preserving details, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

TL;DR: A framework aligns text, audio, video, and motion in a fine-grained joint embedding space, improving motion retrieval performance and user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion retrieval methods lack intuitive interaction and sequential representation, limiting performance and user experience.

Method: Sequence-level contrastive learning aligns four modalities (text, audio, video, motion) for better retrieval.

Result: Achieves 10.16% improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion and 25.43% in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval.

Conclusion: Multi-modal motion retrieval, especially with audio, enhances performance and user immersion, advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

TL;DR: A new dataset for segmenting flooded areas in satellite images is introduced, addressing a gap in existing benchmarks. It includes 10 images per location from five Midwestern USA states, tested with state-of-the-art models, showing modest results and highlighting future research needs.


<details>

Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack suitable datasets for flooded area segmentation in satellite imagery, prompting the creation of a novel dataset.

Method: Collected satellite imagery of 2019 Midwestern USA floods, processed for uniform resolution, and tested with semantic segmentation models, including an ablation study on window sizes.

Result: Models showed modest performance, indicating a need for improved multimodal and temporal learning strategies.

Conclusion: The dataset fills a critical gap and will be publicly available, encouraging further research in flood segmentation.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs

both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the

ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) method to generate adversarial images for MLLMs, embedding target semantics in noise for robust attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deceive MLLMs with adversarial images while minimizing distortion, addressing limitations of traditional high-frequency perturbation methods.

Method: AGD introduces adversarial-guided noise in reverse diffusion, embedding adversarial signals across the full frequency spectrum.

Result: AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack efficacy and robustness against defenses like low-pass filtering.

Conclusion: AGD provides a robust and effective approach for adversarial attacks on MLLMs by leveraging diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

*Xiaoyu Ji,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining supervised baseline and instance classification models improves agglomeration detection in food crystal images, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and size prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is challenging due to water transparency and limited perspective, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Proposes a supervised baseline model for pseudo-labels, an instance classification model for segmentation, and a post-processing module to preserve crystal properties.

Result: Improves true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution predictions, validated under two confidence levels.

Conclusion: The method effectively classifies agglomerated instances, addressing annotation challenges and enhancing food product quality assessment.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

TL;DR: The paper proposes YOLO-ROC, a lightweight and high-precision model for road damage detection, addressing challenges of multi-scale feature extraction and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve road damage detection by overcoming limitations in multi-scale feature extraction and computational demands of existing deep learning models.

Method: Introduces the BMS-SPPF module for enhanced multi-scale feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce complexity.

Result: Achieves 67.6% mAP50, outperforming YOLOv8n by 2.11%, with significant improvements in small-target detection and reduced model size (2.0 MB).

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC is effective for real-time road damage detection, offering high precision, lightweight design, and strong generalization.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual

adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL), expanding unlabeled data to include base and novel classes, and proposes ALDC to address distribution bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Semi-FSCIL methods assume unlabeled data is limited to novel classes, which is impractical. The paper aims to better align with real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) to dynamically correct feature distributions using base samples.

Result: ALDC outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The GSemi-FSCIL framework and ALDC strategy effectively address the challenge of distinguishing unlabeled samples from base and novel classes.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-QR is a reinforcement learning framework for query rewriting in RAG systems, improving retrieval performance without human-annotated data. It shows gains for multi-modal and lexical retrievers but struggles with semantic/hybrid ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents in RAG systems is challenging, and human-annotated datasets are often unavailable.

Method: RL-QR uses reinforcement learning (GRPO) to train query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, synthesizing scenario-question pairs for training.

Result: RL-QR improves NDCG@3 by 11% for multi-modal RAG and 9% for lexical retrievers, but fails with semantic/hybrid retrievers due to training misalignments.

Conclusion: RL-QR offers a scalable, annotation-free solution for query optimization in RAG systems, with potential for further refinement in semantic retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

*Lei Xie,Jiahao Huang,Jiawei Zhang,Jianzhong He,Yiang Pan,Guoqiang Xie,Mengjun Li,Qingrun Zeng,Mingchu Li,Yuanjing Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents the first comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of cranial nerve (CN) pathways in the human brain, using multi-stage fiber clustering on data from 50 subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping CN pathways is challenging due to their unique anatomical structures and the complexity of the skull base. This work aims to provide a detailed and automated solution.

Method: Multi-stage fiber clustering is applied to ~1,000,000 streamlines from 50 HCP subjects, generating a CN atlas. The atlas is validated against expert annotations and clinical cases.

Result: The atlas successfully identifies 8 fiber bundles for 5 CN pairs, showing high spatial correspondence with expert annotations across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The CN atlas enhances automated mapping of CN pathways, improving analysis and understanding of complex brain structures.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

*Fereshteh Aghaee Meibodi,Shadi Alijani,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive review of generic object tracking methods, focusing on Siamese-based, discriminative, and transformer-based approaches, with emphasis on the latter's advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in generic object tracking, such as occlusions and appearance variations, by reviewing and comparing existing paradigms.

Method: Analyzes core design principles, innovations, and limitations of Siamese-based, discriminative, and transformer-based trackers through qualitative and quantitative comparisons.

Result: Introduces a novel categorization, unified visual and tabular comparison, and summarizes evaluation benchmarks, highlighting transformer-based trackers' strengths.

Conclusion: Transformer-based methods show robust spatio-temporal modeling, driving rapid advancements in the field.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

### [92] [Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253)
*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TGSI and SATL for evaluating and improving time series forecasting by focusing on geometric structure, outperforming baselines in accuracy and structure metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like MSE fail to capture geometric structure in time series, which is crucial for understanding temporal dynamics.

Method: Introduces TGSI (image-based metric) and SATL (multi-component loss with first-order difference, frequency domain, and perceptual feature losses).

Result: Models trained with SATL outperform baselines in both MSE and TGSI metrics without added inference cost.

Conclusion: SATL effectively enhances time series structure modeling, improving forecasting accuracy and geometric evaluation.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

### [93] [Learning Semantic-Aware Threshold for Multi-Label Image Recognition with Partial Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23263)
*Haoxian Ruan,Zhihua Xu,Zhijing Yang,Guang Ma,Jieming Xie,Changxiang Fan,Tianshui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATL, a method for multi-label image recognition with partial labels, dynamically updating category-specific thresholds to improve pseudo-label accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for MLR-PL use fixed thresholds, ignoring varying score distributions across categories, leading to inaccurate pseudo-labels and poor performance.

Method: Proposes SATL, which calculates and updates category-specific thresholds based on score distributions of positive and negative samples, and uses differential ranking loss to enhance threshold discrimination.

Result: Experiments on COCO and VG-200 show SATL significantly improves performance in label-limited scenarios.

Conclusion: SATL effectively addresses the limitations of fixed-threshold methods, enhancing accuracy and performance in MLR-PL tasks.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

*Shuai Wang,Ziteng Gao,Chenhui Zhu,Weilin Huang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelNerd (Pixel Neural Field Diffusion) is an efficient, single-stage, end-to-end solution for image generation, avoiding the pitfalls of two-stage VAE-based methods and complex pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformers rely on pre-trained VAEs, leading to accumulated errors and artifacts. Researchers seek simpler, more efficient alternatives.

Method: Proposes PixelNerd, a patch-wise decoding model using neural fields, eliminating the need for VAEs or cascade pipelines.

Result: Achieves 2.15 FID on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.84 FID on 512x512, with competitive scores in text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: PixelNerd offers a streamlined, high-performance alternative to traditional diffusion methods.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

### [95] [Towards Affordable Tumor Segmentation and Visualization for 3D Breast MRI Using SAM2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23272)
*Solha Kang,Eugene Kim,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2, a zero-shot model, is adapted for low-cost 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI using minimal input (one bounding box). Center-outward propagation yields the best results, showing promise for resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D breast MRI interpretation is labor-intensive and subjective. Commercial AI tools are costly and inaccessible in low- and middle-income countries.

Method: SAM2 is used with a single bounding box annotation on one slice, propagated across the 3D volume via three strategies (top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, center-outward).

Result: Center-outward propagation is most accurate. SAM2 performs well despite no training on medical data, with performance linked to tumor size, location, and shape.

Conclusion: General-purpose models like SAM2 can enable affordable 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, benefiting resource-constrained areas.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

### [96] [iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23277)
*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iLRM introduces an iterative refinement model for scalable 3D Gaussian splatting, improving efficiency and quality over transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and computational cost issues in feed-forward 3D reconstruction, especially with transformer architectures.

Method: Uses iterative refinement, decoupling scene representation, two-stage attention, and high-resolution injection.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, with superior scalability.

Conclusion: iLRM offers a scalable, efficient solution for high-quality 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP extends CLIP for reconstruction, generation, and editing without degrading comprehension, using a two-stage training scheme and self-distillation. It outperforms similar models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify reconstruction, generation, and editing tasks in CLIP without compromising its comprehension capabilities or requiring additional decoders.

Method: Introduces a two-stage training scheme, self-distillation, and a dual-condition architecture connecting MLLM and diffusion transformer.

Result: Scores 0.87 (GenEval) and 0.53 (WISE) in text-to-image generation, and 3.62 (ImgEdit Benchmark) in editing, surpassing competitors.

Conclusion: UniLIP successfully expands CLIP's applications, maintaining comprehension while excelling in generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLiM framework with CPN improves text-video retrieval by addressing candidate prior bias, outperforming SOTA by 6.4 R@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive MLLM use introduces candidate prior bias, favoring high-prior candidates over relevant ones.

Method: Proposes BLiM, a bidirectional likelihood framework, and CPN for score calibration.

Result: BLiM+CPN outperforms SOTA by 6.4 R@1 on benchmarks, reducing bias.

Conclusion: BLiM and CPN effectively address prior bias, enhancing retrieval and broader multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

*Inbum Heo,Taewook Hwang,Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layout Error Detection (LED), a benchmark for evaluating structural robustness in document layout predictions, addressing limitations of traditional metrics like IoU and mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics (IoU, mAP) fail to detect critical structural errors in document layout analysis, necessitating a more robust benchmark.

Method: Proposes LED, defining eight error types and three tasks (error existence, type classification, element-wise classification), and constructs LED-Dataset with synthetic errors.

Result: LED effectively differentiates structural understanding in models, revealing biases and trade-offs not captured by traditional metrics.

Conclusion: LED provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating structural errors, enhancing the assessment of document layout models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

*Hanshen Zhu,Zhen Zhu,Kaile Zhang,Yiming Gong,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled pipeline for geometric image editing separates object transformation, inpainting, and refinement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based editing methods struggle with large or complex transformations, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: Proposes a decoupled pipeline using FreeFine, a training-free diffusion method, for inpainting and refinement.

Result: FreeFine excels in image fidelity and edit precision on the GeoBench benchmark, especially for demanding transformations.

Conclusion: The decoupled pipeline with FreeFine offers superior performance in geometric image editing tasks.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a concise, annotation-efficient framework for semi-supervised camouflaged object detection, using self-training and hybrid prompts to outperform existing methods with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations and address prediction bias and computational overhead in existing SSCOD methods.

Method: Employs self-training with dynamic pseudo-label filtering and hybrid prompts leveraging the Segment Anything Model for specialized tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, matching fully supervised methods while training only a single network.

Conclusion: ST-SAM sets a new paradigm for efficient SSCOD, avoiding inter-model bias and computational overhead.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PriorFusion, a framework integrating semantic, geometric, and generative priors to improve road perception in autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in road perception for autonomous vehicles in complex environments without HD maps, where existing methods fail to exploit structured priors.

Method: Uses an instance-aware attention mechanism, shape-prior features, and a diffusion-based framework with prior anchors for accurate predictions.

Result: Significantly improves perception accuracy on large-scale datasets, especially in challenging conditions, with more regular and coherent predictions.

Conclusion: PriorFusion effectively enhances road element perception by leveraging structured priors, offering a robust solution for autonomous driving.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

TL;DR: Linear merging of models in continual learning preserves shared knowledge but degrades task-specific knowledge; incremental training merging outperforms parallel training merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how merging models in continual learning affects shared and task-specific knowledge.

Method: Controlled visual cues in computer vision experiments to compare merging models from incremental vs. parallel training.

Result: Merging preserves shared knowledge but degrades task-specific knowledge; incremental training merging performs better.

Conclusion: Incremental training merging is more effective for continual learning than parallel training merging.

Abstract: This paper investigates the linear merging of models in the context of
continual learning (CL). Using controlled visual cues in computer vision
experiments, we demonstrate that merging largely preserves or enhances shared
knowledge, while unshared task-specific knowledge rapidly degrades. We further
find that merging models from an incremental training process consistently
outperforms merging models trained in parallel.

*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Elisabetta Rocchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how text-to-image diffusion models represent content and style in artworks, revealing varying degrees of separation influenced by prompt tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diffusion models internally represent artistic concepts like content and style without explicit training guidance.

Method: Uses cross-attention heatmaps to attribute image pixels to content or style tokens in transformer-based text-to-image models.

Result: Content tokens influence object-related regions, while style tokens affect backgrounds and textures, showing emergent content-style separation.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how generative models represent artistic concepts unsupervised, with code and tools shared for further exploration.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA is a reconstruction-based visual token pruning framework for autonomous driving, focusing on foreground information to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual token pruning methods perform poorly in autonomous driving. Human drivers focus on foreground areas, so retaining such tokens is crucial for decision-making.

Method: Proposes FastDriveVLA with ReconPruner, a plug-and-play pruner using MAE-style pixel reconstruction and adversarial training to prioritize foreground tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark across pruning ratios.

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA effectively reduces computational costs without compromising decision-making in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

*Yiming Yang,Hongbin Lin,Yueru Luo,Suzhong Fu,Chao Zheng,Xinrui Yan,Shuqi Mei,Kun Tang,Shuguang Cui,Zhen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FASTopoWM is a novel framework for lane segment topology reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of existing methods by leveraging latent world models and parallel supervision of queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lane topology reasoning methods struggle with temporal information utilization, pose estimation failures, and insufficient propagation. FASTopoWM aims to overcome these issues.

Method: The framework uses a fast-slow system with latent world models, parallel supervision of queries, and action-conditioned state propagation.

Result: FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark (37.4% mAP for lane detection, 46.3% OLS for centerline perception).

Conclusion: FASTopoWM enhances temporal perception and reasoning, proving effective for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

*Yingkai Wang,Yaoyao Zhu,Xiuding Cai,Yuhao Xiao,Haotian Wu,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation improves robustness to domain shifts by using feature perturbations and adaptive consistency constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in medical images causes performance degradation in segmentation models due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and protocols.

Method: The framework introduces implicit feature perturbations guided by domain statistics, a learnable semantic direction selector, and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler, along with an adaptive consistency constraint.

Result: The approach outperforms existing domain generalization methods on multi-center benchmarks, achieving robust segmentation across diverse clinical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses domain shift challenges in medical image segmentation, enhancing generalizability and reliability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

*Qiang Lu,Waikit Xiu,Xiying Li,Shenyu Hu,Shengbo Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning improves traffic sign recognition, addressing long-tail distribution and small target challenges, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic sign recognition is critical for autonomous driving but faces challenges like long-tail data distribution and small target detection, which degrade performance.

Method: Proposes NanoVerse YOLO for detection (with RepVL-PAN and SPD-Conv) and TSR-MCL for classification (contrasting visual and semantic features).

Result: Achieves 78.4% mAP on TT100K dataset, with 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates data imbalance and scale variation issues, demonstrating superior performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: A robust road surface reconstruction framework using occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels and semantic-guided color enhancement, outperforming prior methods in real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road surface reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving, but existing methods struggle with occlusions, visual clutter, and appearance degradation due to dynamic agents and environmental changes.

Method: Integrates planar-adapted Gaussian representation, segmentation-guided video inpainting, and semantic-aware color correction in HSV space.

Result: Produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful reconstructions, outperforming prior methods in urban-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in road surface reconstruction, offering improved robustness and accuracy for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

*Ahmet Can Ömercikoğlu,Mustafa Mansur Yönügül,Pakize Erdoğmuş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of image resolution on three deep learning-based face detectors (YOLOv11, YOLOv12, MTCNN) using the WIDER FACE dataset. YOLOv11 excels in accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 has better recall, and MTCNN is slower but good for landmark localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face detection is vital for AI applications, but low-resolution images degrade performance. This study aims to understand how resolution affects detection accuracy and robustness.

Method: The study tests YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN on the WIDER FACE dataset at resolutions 160x160, 320x320, and 640x640, measuring precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time.

Result: YOLOv11 performs best in accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 has higher recall, and MTCNN is slower but effective for landmark localization.

Conclusion: The findings help choose resolution-aware face detection models based on operational needs, balancing accuracy, recall, and speed.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces THQA-10K, the largest dataset for assessing AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs), evaluates 12 T2I models and 14 talkers, and proposes a SOTA objective quality assessment method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of comprehensive studies on AGTH quality and the challenges in synthesizing high-quality talking heads.

Method: Created THQA-10K dataset with 10,457 AGTHs, recruited volunteers for subjective ratings, and proposed an objective assessment method using first frame, Y-T slice, and tone-lip consistency.

Result: The proposed objective method achieves SOTA performance in AGTH quality assessment.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust dataset and assessment method to improve AGTH quality, advancing the field of digital human media.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the evolution of design patterns in computer vision, focusing on breakthroughs in deep learning architectures, generative models, and self-supervised techniques.

Method: Examines six influential papers, detailing their contributions: ResNet (residual connections), ViT (Transformer for images), GANs (adversarial training), LDMs (latent diffusion), DINO (self-distillation), and MAE (masked autoencoding).

Result: Identifies key advancements: deeper networks (ResNet), attention-based models (ViT), high-fidelity generation (LDMs), and scalable self-supervised learning (DINO, MAE).

Conclusion: The evolution of computer vision design patterns demonstrates progress in scalability, efficiency, and reduced dependency on labeled data, with LDMs and MAE representing current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

*Ji Ma,Wei Suo,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of applying NLP layer pruning techniques to LVLMs due to modality divergence, proposing a new framework, Short-LVLM, to improve pruning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) face practical limitations due to high computational costs and massive parameters, and existing NLP pruning methods are ineffective for them.

Method: The authors identify challenges in pruning LVLMs (non-essential tokens and inter-layer feature gaps) and propose Short-LVLM, a framework that leverages important tokens and reduces feature gaps.

Result: Short-LVLM achieves a better performance-efficiency trade-off, is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

Conclusion: The proposed Short-LVLM framework effectively addresses pruning challenges in LVLMs, offering practical advantages for deployment.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of Transformer-based feature matching by integrating Mamba's efficient Selective State-Space Model.

Method: Proposes a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network with hierarchical architectures for feature matching.

Result: Achieves new benchmarks efficiently, balancing performance and computational cost for real-time applications.

Conclusion: VMatcher offers a robust, practical solution for feature matching with rapid inference, leveraging the strengths of both Mamba and Transformer.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

TL;DR: UniEmo is a unified framework integrating emotional understanding and generation, using hierarchical feature extraction and diffusion models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional understanding and generation are complementary but often treated separately; UniEmo aims to unify them for mutual enhancement.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with learnable expert queries for multi-scale feature extraction, fused with emotional representations to guide diffusion models for image generation. Introduces emotional correlation coefficient and condition loss for diversity and fidelity.

Result: UniEmo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both tasks, with joint training and feedback processes enhancing understanding capacity.

Conclusion: UniEmo successfully unifies emotional understanding and generation, demonstrating mutual enhancement through joint training and feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MP^2A, a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled tasks, mitigating noise and improving domain-invariant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods align source and target domains in one shot, struggling with noisy samples and multi-source domain gaps.

Method: MP^2A progressively trains on high-confidence target samples first, then incorporates harder samples to refine learning.

Result: MP^2A outperforms recent CLIP-based MS-UDA methods on benchmarks like ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet.

Conclusion: Progressive alignment effectively reduces confirmation bias and enhances domain-invariant feature learning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: To overcome 3DGS's sensitivity to initialization, limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations by integrating NeRF's strengths.

Method: Joint optimization of NeRF and 3DGS, aligning spatial features and optimizing residual vectors for implicit features and Gaussian positions.

Result: NeRF-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the complementary nature of NeRF and 3DGS.

Conclusion: NeRF and 3DGS are complementary, enabling efficient hybrid 3D scene representation.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a framework for learning medical visual representations by capturing structured semantics from paired images and reports, avoiding the need for hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods simplify clinical reports into single entities or tokens and rely on large quantities of hard negatives, which is impractical for small-scale medical datasets.

Result: AGA achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks in fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: AGA effectively addresses the limitations of current methods by leveraging structured semantics and adaptive grouping, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

*Lemar Abdi,Francisco Caetano,Amaan Valiuddin,Christiaan Viviers,Hamdi Joudeh,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a reconstruction-free OOD detection method using Stein score-based denoising diffusion models (SBDDM) for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised OOD detection is needed for rare pathological cases in medical imaging, but current methods are computationally expensive and unreliable.

Method: Leverages forward diffusion trajectories of SBDDM to capture trajectory curvature via Stein scores, enabling anomaly scoring with minimal steps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 18.10% improvement in Far-OOD detection and reduces computational cost.

Conclusion: SBDDM is a practical, efficient solution for real-time computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging.

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

*Mokhtar A. Al-Awadhi,Ratnadeep R. Deshmukh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning system using hyperspectral imaging detects honey adulteration with 96.39% accuracy, combining LDA for feature extraction and KNN for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an automated, accurate alternative to chemical-based methods for detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup.

Method: Uses LDA for feature extraction and KNN for classification in two subsystems: botanical origin identification and adulteration detection.

Result: Achieves 96.39% cross-validation accuracy in detecting adulteration.

Conclusion: The system is effective and suitable as an alternative to traditional chemical methods.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

*Abdellah Zakaria Sellam,Salah Eddine Bekhouche,Cosimo Distante,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing a dual-teacher self-supervised framework for art style classification by replacing MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), improving accuracy by modeling nonlinear feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Art style classification is challenging due to limited labeled data and complex style-feature interactions. Existing methods struggle with global context and nonlinear correlations.

Method: The authors replace MLP projection and prediction heads in a dual-teacher framework with KANs, leveraging spline-based activations for precise nonlinear modeling.

Result: Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k show improved Top-1 accuracy over the base dual-teacher architecture, with better linear probe accuracy.

Conclusion: KANs effectively disentangle complex style manifolds, outperforming MLPs in modeling nonlinear feature interactions for art style classification.

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

*Martin Hermann Paul Fuchs,Behnood Rasti,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HyCASS, a learning-based model for adjustable hyperspectral image (HSI) compression in spectral and spatial dimensions, addressing the need for efficient storage of hyperspectral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives necessitates efficient storage, but the effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression remain underexplored.

Method: HyCASS uses six modules (spectral/spatial encoders/decoders, CR adapter encoder/decoder) with convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture redundancies.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show HyCASS outperforms existing models, providing guidelines for balancing spectral and spatial compression.

Conclusion: HyCASS effectively addresses HSI compression needs, with publicly available code and model weights.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using machine learning (CNN and DenseNet-121) for binary classification of chest X-ray images, showing DenseNet-121's superior focus on key image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage machine learning for accurate medical predictions without explicit programming, using chest X-ray images as a case study.

Method: Implemented baseline CNN and DenseNet-121 on 5,824 chest X-ray images for binary classification, analyzed using gradient-weighted class activation mapping.

Result: Both models performed well, but DenseNet-121 more accurately focused on critical image regions for decision-making.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 outperforms baseline CNN in identifying key features in chest X-ray images for medical predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

### [125] [Mitigating Resolution-Drift in Federated Learning: Case of Keypoint Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23461)
*Taeheon Lim,Joohyung Lee,Kyungjae Lee,Jungchan Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF) to address resolution drift in non-classification tasks like human pose estimation, enhancing performance without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) has succeeded in classification tasks but struggles with non-classification tasks due to resolution variability (resolution drift), a critical but underexplored issue.

Method: RAF uses heatmap-based knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from higher-resolution outputs (teachers) to lower-resolution outputs (students) to improve resolution robustness.

Result: RAF mitigates resolution drift, improves performance, and integrates seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. t-SNE analysis shows its potential for other high-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: RAF effectively addresses resolution drift in FL for non-classification tasks, with broader applicability to tasks requiring spatial detail preservation.

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

*Bin Xie,Congxuan Zhang,Fagan Wang,Peng Liu,Feng Lu,Zhen Chen,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The CST Anti-UAV dataset addresses limitations in existing UAV tracking datasets by focusing on tiny UAVs in complex scenes, featuring 220 sequences with 240k annotations. Evaluation of 20 SOT methods shows poor performance (35.92% accuracy), highlighting the need for better benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV tracking datasets lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting real-world applicability. This gap motivates the creation of CST Anti-UAV for more robust tracking.

Method: The CST Anti-UAV dataset includes 220 video sequences with 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, emphasizing tiny UAVs and complex scenes. It also provides manual frame-level attribute annotations for precise evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 20 SOT methods on CST Anti-UAV shows low accuracy (35.92%), significantly lower than on simpler datasets (67.69%), indicating the challenge of tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments.

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV highlights the limitations of current benchmarks and the need for advancements in UAV tracking. Its release aims to foster robust SOT methods and anti-UAV system innovation.

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D-R1 is a foundation model enhancing 3D VLMs' reasoning by using a synthetic dataset (Scene-30K), RLHF training, and dynamic view selection, achieving a 10% performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D VLMs lack robust reasoning and generalization due to limited spatial data and static viewpoints.

Method: Constructs Scene-30K dataset, uses RLHF (GRPO) with three rewards, and implements dynamic view selection.

Result: 10% average improvement on 3D scene benchmarks.

Conclusion: 3D-R1 effectively enhances reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the short battery lifetime and data sparsity in compact sensor edge devices for small intestine investigation.

Method: Developed a multi-task neural network with restricted parameters, integrating self-localization and anomaly detection, tested on the Galar dataset with Viterbi decoding.

Result: Achieved 93.63% accuracy in localization and 87.48% in anomaly detection with only 1 million parameters.

Conclusion: The model outperforms single-task baselines, offering a feasible AI solution for energy-efficient video capsule endoscopy.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

Conclusion: FastPoint significantly accelerates 3D point cloud processing without compromising accuracy, enhancing efficiency in state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based
acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between
sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance
curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between synthetic and real-captured 3D data is challenging due to predefined physical priors' limitations.

Method: A two-stage depth diffusion model: first finetunes Stable-Diffusion for residual generation, then refines with a second-stage diffusion prioritizing distinct areas.

Result: Training with simulated data from Stable-Sim2Real improves real-world 3D task performance and achieves high similarity to real-captured patterns.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real offers a robust solution for realistic 3D data simulation, validated by improved task performance and benchmark evaluations.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Motivation: Accurate mass estimation of strawberries is difficult due to occlusions and pose variations, necessitating a non-destructive, real-time solution.

Method: Combines YOLOv8-Seg for segmentation, CycleGAN for occlusion recovery, tilt-angle correction, and polynomial regression for mass mapping.

Result: Achieved mean errors of 8.11% (isolated) and 10.47% (occluded), with CycleGAN outperforming LaMa in occlusion recovery.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust solution for automated harvesting and yield monitoring, overcoming traditional limitations.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hy-CycleAlign, a hyperbolic space-based image registration method for multi-modal fusion, outperforming Euclidean space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean space registration methods struggle with cross-modal misalignment, leading to poor fusion quality.

Method: Introduces Hy-CycleAlign, a dual-path cyclic registration framework in hyperbolic space, and the H$^{2}$CA module for contrastive alignment.

Result: Hy-CycleAlign achieves superior alignment and fusion quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space enables more effective multi-modal image registration, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper explores how minimal sufficient pixel sets can reveal differences in how vision models focus on images, showing variations in concentration across architectures and misclassified images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different vision models make decisions is limited; the study aims to provide insight by analyzing minimal sufficient pixel sets.

Method: Proposes using minimal sufficient pixel sets to measure a model's 'concentration'—key pixels for decision-making—and compares their size, position, and overlap across architectures.

Result: Different architectures (e.g., ConvNext, EVA) show distinct concentration patterns. Misclassified images require larger pixel sets than correct ones.

Conclusion: Minimal sufficient pixel sets offer a valuable tool to compare model decision-making, revealing architectural differences and misclassification patterns.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART is an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that improves visual relation detection (VRD) by instruction tuning VLMs, outperforming baselines and generalizing to unseen relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VRD models trained on limited data struggle with generalization, and existing prompt tuning methods fail for novel or complex relations.

Method: ART converts VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and uses adaptive sampling to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability.

Result: ART outperforms baselines and can infer unseen relations, demonstrating practical value in segmenting complex scenes.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning with ART effectively adapts VLMs for VRD, enhancing generalization and handling novel relations.

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D object detection methods are limited to closed-set settings, failing in real-world applications with new environments and object categories.

Method: The proposed 3D-MOOD lifts open-set 2D detection into 3D space using a 3D bounding box head, incorporates geometry prior, and employs canonical image space for cross-dataset training.

Result: 3D-MOOD achieves state-of-the-art results on closed-set (Omni3D) and open-set (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet) benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the effectiveness of 3D-MOOD in open-set monocular 3D object detection, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

*Maxime Pietrantoni,Gabriela Csurka,Torsten Sattler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs) for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit feature field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve accurate camera pose estimation while preserving privacy, leveraging dense geometric information and differentiable rasterization.

Method: Develop GSFFs by aligning a 3D scale-aware feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a contrastive framework, using 3D structure-informed clustering for regularization and segmentation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets for both privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization.

Conclusion: GSFFs effectively combine explicit geometry and implicit features for robust and privacy-aware visual localization.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: BeyondGloss is a gloss-free SLT framework using VideoLLMs for fine-grained hand motion descriptions, achieving SOTA results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information in SLT, while capturing subtle hand variations.

Method: Leverages VideoLLMs, generates fine-grained hand motion descriptions, uses contrastive alignment, and distills features from HaMeR.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss effectively addresses SLT challenges, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

*Yaoye Zhu,Zhe Wang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MamV2XCalib is a V2X-based method for infrastructure camera calibration using vehicle-side LiDAR, eliminating manual intervention and achieving robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual calibration methods are inefficient and require road closures, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: MamV2XCalib leverages vehicle-side LiDAR and a targetless calibration approach using multi-scale features and a 4D correlation volume, with temporal modeling via Mamba.

Result: The method outperforms previous LiDAR-camera calibration methods in V2X scenarios, showing better stability and fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib provides an effective, automated solution for infrastructure camera calibration, validated on real-world datasets.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

*Zijian Dong,Longteng Duan,Jie Song,Michael J. Black,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGA reconstructs high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from single-view images using a generative avatar model and 2D diffusion models, ensuring 3D consistency and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is inferring unseen appearance and geometric details from a single view while maintaining 3D consistency, as previous methods using 2D diffusion models produce inconsistent and unrealistic results.

Method: MoGA integrates a generative avatar model as a prior, projects input images into its latent space, and enforces 3D constraints. It formulates avatar creation as a model inversion process, refining pose estimation and ensuring 3D regularization.

Result: MoGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generalizes well to real-world scenarios, and produces animatable Gaussian avatars.

Conclusion: MoGA effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by combining generative models and 3D constraints, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D avatars.

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

*Yuchen Zhou,Yan Luo,Xiangang Wang,Xingjian Gu,Mingzhou Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A directional pure 2D approach for 3D occupancy prediction balances accuracy and speed, achieving 39.3% mIoU and 27.7 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving prioritize accuracy over real-time processing, creating a need for a balanced solution.

Method: The method slices 3D voxel features to retain vertical geometry and uses directional attention to extract features efficiently.

Result: Achieves 39.3% mIoU and 27.7 FPS on Occ3D-nuScenes, with 14.8 FPS on edge devices.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [141] [Mamba-based Efficient Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601)
*Xin Li,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vcamba, a novel method for video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) that integrates spatial and frequency features for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCOD methods rely on spatial appearance features, which are limited due to high similarity between foreground and background. Frequency features and the Mamba model offer potential enhancements.

Method: Vcamba combines spatial and frequency features using modules like RFVSS for spatial features, AFE for frequency learning, and SLMP/FLMP for motion perception. SFMF integrates these features.

Result: Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 6 metrics across 2 datasets with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The integration of spatial and frequency features in Vcamba significantly improves VCOD performance, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: The MIDI-B Challenge standardized benchmarking of DICOM image de-identification tools, ensuring HIPAA compliance while preserving research-critical metadata. Ten teams achieved high accuracy (97.91%-99.93%) using diverse methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for standardized de-identification of medical images (PHI/PII) while preserving non-PHI metadata for AI research, ensuring compliance with privacy laws.

Method: The challenge had three phases (training, validation, test) using synthetic PHI/PII in DICOM images. Teams used open-source/proprietary tools, LLMs, and OCR.

Result: Ten teams completed the test phase, achieving scores between 97.91% and 99.93% for correct de-identification actions.

Conclusion: The MIDI-B Challenge successfully demonstrated the feasibility of rule-based de-identification, highlighting diverse tools and high accuracy, with lessons for future improvements.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl is a decomposable pretraining framework for unified controllable image generation, enabling efficient adaptation to novel conditions with reduced training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable image generation either require separate models per condition or use entangled representations, leading to poor generalization and high adaptation costs.

Method: DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into disentangled components (learngenes and tailors) and uses a dynamic gate for knowledge diversion, along with a representation alignment loss.

Result: DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability with 36.4x less training cost, improves performance on basic conditions, and excels in zero-shot and few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: DivControl offers superior scalability, modularity, and transferability, making it a robust solution for controllable image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA struggles with small objects in FS-CS tasks, and evaluation settings waste costly annotations.

Method: EMAT uses a memory-efficient masked attention mechanism, learnable downscaling, and parameter-efficiency enhancements.

Result: EMAT outperforms SOTA on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i with 4x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: EMAT advances FS-CS performance and introduces better evaluation settings for practical use.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

TL;DR: A Forward-Forward (FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for SNNs is proposed, eliminating gradient approximation and reducing computational complexity, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training SNNs efficiently is challenging due to non-differentiability and high computational demands of backpropagation. Existing gradient approximation methods compromise accuracy and edge deployment.

Method: The framework treats spiking activations as black-box modules, avoiding gradient approximation. It includes a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism for dynamic loss optimization.

Result: Achieves 99.58%, 92.13%, and 75.64% accuracy on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, outperforming existing FF-based SNN methods, with reduced memory and computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed FF-based framework is efficient, accurate, and suitable for edge devices, advancing SNN training without gradient approximation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed

TL;DR: A framework called Adaptively Distilled ControlNet improves medical image segmentation by distilling knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, enhancing privacy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation faces privacy and labeling challenges, limiting segmentation models. Existing diffusion models lack precise lesion-mask alignment.

Method: The framework uses dual-model distillation: a teacher model (trained on mask-image pairs) guides a mask-only student model via noise alignment and adaptive regularization. Only the student is used during sampling for privacy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19; SANet gains 2.6%/3.5% on Polyps.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses privacy and performance issues in medical image segmentation, demonstrating superior results.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves

TL;DR: OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model, addresses zero-shot transfer challenges in trajectory prediction by explicitly conditioning on temporal metadata, achieving superior performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained models struggle with zero-shot transfer to datasets with varying temporal dynamics, requiring fine-tuning and limiting scalability.

Method: The study isolates temporal generalization issues and introduces OmniTraj, which uses explicit temporal metadata conditioning for robust zero-shot transfer.

Result: OmniTraj reduces prediction error by over 70% in cross-setup scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning on four datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit temporal conditioning is highly effective for zero-shot transfer, making OmniTraj a scalable and practical solution for trajectory prediction.

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in HSI due to data limitations and hardware variations by leveraging user-guided segmentation and spectral fusion.

Method: Combines RGB foundation model with spectral analysis, using user clicks to guide segmentation and spectral similarity. Operates independently of spectral band count/resolution.

Result: Achieves 81.0-93.4% DICE scores on neurosurgical and porcine datasets with 1-5 clicks, effective in few/zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: SAMSA provides a flexible, accurate framework for HSI medical image analysis, integrating diverse datasets seamlessly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal
training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with
different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

*Jialei Chen,Wuhao Xu,Sipeng He,Baoru Huang,Dongchun Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I2V-GS introduces a method to synthesize autonomous driving data from infrastructure views using Gaussian Splatting, outperforming existing methods in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving data collection is costly and inefficient; synthesizing data from real-world images offers a viable alternative.

Method: Uses adaptive depth warp for dense training views, cascade inpainting for view expansion, and cross-view confidence-guided optimization.

Result: I2V-GS improves synthesis quality by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9% in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID metrics, respectively.

Conclusion: I2V-GS is the first framework to generate driving datasets via infrastructure-vehicle view transformation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) by leveraging the generative capacity of diffusion models for diverse degradations.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating low-quality visual priors into LDMs, with DAFF for adaptive degradation handling and DAEM for detail recovery.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing methods in multi-task and mixed degradation settings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration, with code to be released.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowGaussian-VR, a method for high-fidelity 3D video reconstruction using flow-empowered velocity fields to address challenges in complex motion and scale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deformation networks in 3D Gaussian splatting overfit to irregular trajectories and struggle with dynamic content, leading to suboptimal visual quality.

Method: Proposes FlowGaussian-VR with a velocity field rendering pipeline for optical flow-based optimization and a flow-assisted adaptive densification strategy.

Result: Achieves notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB PSNR gain), less blurry artifacts, and regularized Gaussian trajectories in challenging motion scenarios.

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR effectively enhances dynamic scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve explainability in image classification by incorporating risk estimation into pixel attribution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overconfidence in deep learning models' predictions and pixel attribution, enhancing decision-making in tumor resections.

Method: Iteratively applies a classification model with pixel attribution to create a volume of PA maps, generating pixel-wise distributions and estimating expectation values and risk via coefficient of variation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on pCLE data and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances explainability and provides risk estimation, improving reliability in clinical applications.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

*Emery Pierson,Lei Li,Angela Dai,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven approach to replace axiomatic methods for functional map regularization and training, using a generative model in the spectral domain for improved accuracy and generality in non-rigid shape matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on axiomatic models for functional map regularization and training, limiting accuracy and applicability. The paper aims to replace these with data-driven techniques.

Method: A generative model of functional maps is trained in the spectral domain using score-based generative modeling. The model promotes structural properties of ground truth maps on new shapes.

Result: The learned models are category-agnostic and outperform axiomatic approaches in zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Conclusion: Data-driven regularization and training can fully replace axiomatic methods, leading to better performance in non-rigid shape correspondence tasks.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGNet, a large-scale affordance segmentation benchmark, and AffordanceNet, a framework for robotic grasping, addressing the lack of reasoning-based data in open-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic grasping systems lack reasoning-based large-scale affordance data, limiting their effectiveness in open-world scenarios.

Method: The authors build RAGNet, a benchmark with 273k images and 26k reasoning instructions, and propose AffordanceNet, combining a VLM and a grasping network.

Result: AffordanceNet demonstrates strong open-world generalization in affordance segmentation and real-robot tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable solution for affordance-based robotic grasping with improved generalization.

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

TL;DR: DIAS improves Slot Attention in OCL by re-initializing redundant slots and using self-distillation for better object representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in slots and lack of internal supervision in current OCL methods.

Method: Re-initialize redundant slots and use self-distillation to refine attention maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in object discovery, recognition, and visual tasks.

Conclusion: DIAS enhances Slot Attention, improving performance in OCL tasks.

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeqAffordSplat, a benchmark for sequential 3D affordance reasoning, and SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework leveraging LLMs and geometric pre-training to handle complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D affordance reasoning are limited to single-object, single-step interactions, insufficient for real-world applications requiring long-horizon, multi-object tasks.

Method: Proposes SeqSplatNet, which uses a large language model to autoregressively generate text with segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder for 3D mask production. Includes geometric pre-training and 2D semantic feature fusion.

Result: SeqSplatNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SeqAffordSplat benchmark, advancing affordance reasoning to sequential tasks.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in 3D affordance reasoning, enabling complex, sequential interactions in 3D environments.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

TL;DR: A novel 'half-physics' method enhances SMPL-X models by enabling dynamic physical interactions, eliminating issues like interpenetration and unrealistic dynamics, without requiring learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) lack physical interaction capabilities, leading to unrealistic dynamics and interpenetration.

Method: Proposes a 'half-physics' mechanism to convert kinematic motion into physics simulation, maintaining kinematic control while ensuring plausible interactions.

Result: Achieves real-time, learning-free physical interactions, generalizing to any body shape/motion without compromising kinematic fidelity.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between kinematic models and physics-based interactions, offering a practical and efficient solution.

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI grounding models for CUAs have low accuracy (<65%), hindering deployment. The study aims to improve grounding models for reliable agent actions.

Method: An empirical study on grounding model training, covering data collection to model training, leading to the development of Phi-Ground.

Result: Phi-Ground achieves SOTA performance on five benchmarks for models under 10B parameters, with scores of 43.2 on ScreenSpot-pro and 27.2 on UI-Vision.

Conclusion: The study clarifies grounding model construction and benefits perception tasks, with Phi-Ground demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the

not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos, improving upon dense multi-view setups by aligning monocular reconstructions for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense multi-view setups are costly and impractical for diverse real-world scenes, prompting the need for sparse-view solutions.

Method: The method aligns independent monocular reconstructions from sparse-view cameras to achieve time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions.

Result: The approach outperforms prior methods, especially in novel view rendering, as shown in experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical and effective solution for dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs struggle with concept reliability under distribution shifts, limiting their transparency in critical fields like medicine.

Method: Developed SUB, a synthetic image benchmark using the CUB dataset, and introduced Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) for precise image generation.

Result: SUB enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs, revealing their limitations under concept variations.

Conclusion: The benchmark and TDG method contribute to developing more robust interpretable models.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 4D diffusion modeling due to costly data construction and high-dimensional representation of 3D shape, appearance, and motion.

Method: Introduces a VAE for encoding Gaussian Splats and their temporal variations, compressing animations into a latent space, and trains a diffusion model conditioned on input videos.

Result: Superior generation quality and generalization to in-the-wild videos, despite training on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Paves the way for high-quality animated 3D content generation from videos.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Method: Layers define explicit state over time (e.g., Transformer KV cache) and a step method for state evolution, ensuring identical results to stateless layer-wise invocation.

Result: Enables immediate streaming, reduces bugs, and supports composable, declarative model construction.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers provides a robust, flexible framework for building production-scale sequence models with correctness guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

### [164] [Deep Learning-based Prediction of Clinical Trial Enrollment with Uncertainty Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23607)
*Tien Huu Do,Antoine Masquelier,Nae Eoun Lee,Jonathan Crowther*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning method using pre-trained language models and attention mechanisms improves clinical trial enrollment predictions, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate patient enrollment prediction is critical for clinical trial success but challenging due to complexities in clinical documents and uncertainties.

Method: A neural network model combines PLM-derived document representations with tabular features via attention, enhanced with a Gamma distribution layer for uncertainty.

Result: The method effectively predicts patient enrollment at trial sites, outperforming baseline models in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach enhances enrollment prediction accuracy, aiding clinical trial planning.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

*Muhammad Taha Cheema,Abeer Aamir,Khawaja Gul Muhammad,Naveed Anwar Bhatti,Ihsan Ayyub Qazi,Zafar Ayyub Qazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TweakLLM is a routing architecture using a lightweight LLM to adapt cached responses dynamically, improving cache effectiveness without sacrificing response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient response caching in LLMs is challenging due to personalized interactions and limited semantic search accuracy.

Method: TweakLLM employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically tweak cached responses for incoming prompts.

Result: TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness.

Conclusion: TweakLLM is a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

### [166] [Planning for Cooler Cities: A Multimodal AI Framework for Predicting and Mitigating Urban Heat Stress through Urban Landscape Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23000)
*Shengao Yi,Xiaojiang Li,Wei Tu,Tianhong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSM-UTCI, a deep learning model, predicts hyperlocal UTCI with high accuracy, aiding urban heat mitigation planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cities struggle with heat stress due to climate change, needing scalable tools for heat exposure assessment.

Method: Uses multimodal deep learning (FiLM architecture) with nDSM, land cover, and weather data, trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps.

Result: Achieves R2 of 0.9151 and MAE of 0.41°C, reducing computation time from hours to minutes. Demonstrates cooling effects of urban greening.

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI is a scalable, precise tool for evaluating urban heat mitigation strategies.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

### [167] [Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010)
*Siwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores inverse capabilities of multimodal latent spaces in AI models, finding them unreliable for meaningful inverse mappings despite optimization efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multimodal latent spaces in task-specific AI models can support semantically meaningful inverse mappings, given their success in forward tasks.

Method: An optimization-based framework is applied bidirectionally across Text-Image and Text-Audio modalities to infer input characteristics from outputs.

Result: Optimization can align outputs textually but fails to produce perceptually coherent or semantically meaningful inverse mappings.

Conclusion: Multimodal latent spaces lack inherent structure for robust inverse mappings, highlighting the need for further research into invertible spaces.

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

*Sofiane Bouaziz,Adel Hafiane,Raphael Canals,Rachid Nedjai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuseTen is a generative framework that fuses satellite data to produce daily Land Surface Temperature (LST) at 10m resolution, outperforming baselines by ~32%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation require accurate LST data, but satellite trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolution limit availability.

Method: FuseTen combines Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS data using a generative architecture with attention, normalization, and PatchGAN for realism.

Result: FuseTen improves quantitative metrics by 32.06% and visual fidelity by 31.42% over linear baselines.

Conclusion: FuseTen is the first non-linear method to generate daily 10m-resolution LST, addressing critical gaps in climate monitoring.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

*Chih-Fan Hsu,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CL framework, Experience Blending, uses synthetic boundary data (SBD) and stored key samples to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, outperforming baselines by 10-13% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of sparse key samples in experience replay by introducing synthetic data near decision boundaries to improve boundary stability.

Method: Proposes Experience Blending: (1) DP noise mechanism to generate SBD, and (2) joint training with stored key samples and SBD.

Result: Outperforms nine CL baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet with accuracy gains of 10%, 6%, and 13%.

Conclusion: Experience Blending effectively mitigates forgetting by leveraging synthetic boundary data, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

*Rabeya Tus Sadia,Qiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DepMicroDiff is a new framework for microbiome data imputation that combines diffusion-based modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current microbiome data imputation methods struggle with sparsity, noise, and lack of contextual metadata integration, limiting their effectiveness for downstream tasks like biomarker discovery.

Method: DepMicroDiff integrates diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT), uses VAE-based pretraining, and conditions on patient metadata encoded via an LLM.

Result: DepMicroDiff achieves higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff is a robust and generalizable solution for microbiome imputation, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

*Justin Kay,Grant Van Horn,Subhransu Maji,Daniel Sheldon,Sara Beery*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CODA is a method for active model selection that reduces annotation effort by 70% compared to prior methods, using consensus-driven predictions and Bayesian inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model selection requires costly validation datasets; CODA aims to minimize annotation effort by efficiently identifying the best model.

Method: CODA uses a probabilistic framework to model relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points, leveraging consensus and disagreement to guide label acquisition.

Result: CODA outperforms existing methods, reducing annotation effort by over 70% on 26 benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: CODA provides an efficient, scalable solution for active model selection, significantly lowering annotation costs.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Motivation: To address the lack of systematic benchmarks for evaluating the efficacy and limitations of data science agents powered by LLMs.

Method: A comprehensive benchmark reflecting real-world interactions, evaluating three LLMs (Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, OpenAI-o4-Mini) across three approaches (zero-shot, multi-step, SmolAgent) on eight task categories. Sensitivity to prompting issues and temperature effects are also analyzed.

Result: Distinct performance disparities among models and methodologies, with insights into factors affecting practical deployment.

Conclusion: The benchmark and framework aim to guide future research for more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,

context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation

TL;DR: TextQuests is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' long-context reasoning in exploratory environments, using text-based adventures to test self-contained problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack assessment of autonomous, long-horizon reasoning in exploratory settings.

Method: Introduces TextQuests, a benchmark based on Infocom interactive fiction games, focusing on intrinsic reasoning without external tools.

Result: Provides a tool for evaluating AI agents' sustained problem-solving and trial-and-error learning in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: TextQuests advances AI agent evaluation by addressing gaps in long-horizon, exploratory reasoning.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

TL;DR: Seed-Prover, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model, leverages Lean feedback and self-summarization to refine proofs, achieving high success rates on IMO and Putnam problems. Seed-Geometry addresses Lean's geometry limitations, contributing to solving 5/6 IMO 2025 problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with theorem proving due to unclear supervision in natural language. Formal languages like Lean provide clear verification, enabling effective training.

Method: Seed-Prover iteratively refines proofs using Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. Three test-time inference strategies are designed for deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Geometry is introduced for geometry support.

Result: Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves >50% on PutnamBench. Seed-Geometry outperforms previous formal geometry engines. 5/6 IMO 2025 problems are fully proven.

Conclusion: Formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning significantly advances automated mathematical reasoning, as demonstrated by Seed-Prover and Seed-Geometry.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct is effective for generating high-quality synthetic data, improving LLM performance in reasoning and instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For

TL;DR: SimuRA introduces a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning, overcoming autoregressive LLM limitations by using a world model for planning via simulation. It improves task success significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents focus on one-task-one-agent approaches, lacking scalability and generality. Humans, however, reason by simulating outcomes, inspiring a more general AI agent design.

Method: SimuRA uses a world model implemented with LLMs for flexible planning in diverse environments. It leverages natural language's concept-rich latent space for simulation-based reasoning.

Result: Experiments show SimuRA improves flight search success from 0% to 32.2%, with world-model-based planning outperforming autoregressive methods by up to 124%.

Conclusion: SimuRA demonstrates the potential for training a single, general AI agent using LLMs, with promising results in web-browsing tasks. A public demo is available for further testing.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

*David A Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal explanations for image classifiers, combining formal rigor with practical computability, and proposes contrastive and confidence-aware complete explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods for image classifiers lack formal rigor or rely on impractical assumptions. Causal explanations bridge this gap.

Method: The paper defines causal explanations, proves their formal properties, and introduces contrastive and complete explanations. Algorithms are implemented for black-box models.

Result: Experiments show varying patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness across models. Algorithms are efficient (6s/image on ResNet50) and fully black-box.

Conclusion: Causal explanations offer a rigorous, practical solution for explaining image classifiers, with efficient and model-agnostic algorithms.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

### [178] [Exploring Dynamic Parameters for Vietnamese Gender-Independent ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22964)
*Sotheara Leang,Éric Castelli,Dominique Vaufreydaz,Sethserey Sam*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces polar parameters for Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) to enhance ASR by capturing speech dynamics and reducing spectral variation. Combined with MFCCs, these parameters improve Vietnamese ASR performance, showing lower word error rates and better gender independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ASR by better capturing dynamic speech characteristics and tonal information, addressing limitations of traditional MFCCs.

Method: Used polar parameters of SSCFs to describe acoustic transitions, combined with MFCCs, and introduced SSCF0 as a pseudo-feature for F0 in Vietnamese ASR.

Result: Proposed parameters significantly reduced word error rates and demonstrated greater gender independence compared to baseline MFCCs.

Conclusion: The SSCF-based dynamic parameters enhance ASR performance, particularly in tonal languages like Vietnamese, by improving spectral detail and robustness.

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

### [179] [MECAT: A Multi-Experts Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23511)
*Yadong Niu,Tianzi Wang,Heinrich Dinkel,Xingwei Sun,Jiahao Zhou,Gang Li,Jizhong Liu,Xunying Liu,Junbo Zhang,Jian Luan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces MECAT, a benchmark for fine-grained audio understanding, and a novel metric (DATE) to evaluate detailed model outputs, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack the ability to distinguish between generic and detailed audio model outputs, limiting nuanced comprehension.

Method: MECAT is created using expert models and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, providing multi-perspective captions and QA pairs. DATE metric combines semantic similarity and discriminability.

Result: The benchmark and metric offer new insights into state-of-the-art audio models' capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: MECAT and DATE advance audio understanding by enabling finer-grained evaluation of models.

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

### [180] [Rethink Domain Generalization in Heterogeneous Sequence MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23110)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Linkai Peng,Wanying Dou,Cuiling Sun,Halil Ertugrul Aktas,Andrea M. Bejar,Elif Keles,Gorkem Durak,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PancreasDG is a multi-center 3D MRI dataset for pancreas segmentation, addressing domain generalization challenges in medical imaging, including cross-center and cross-sequence variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook variability in MR sequences, and pancreas segmentation is challenging due to its small size, low contrast, and under-representation in datasets despite clinical importance.

Method: The dataset includes 563 MRI scans from six institutions with pixel-accurate masks. A semi-supervised approach leveraging anatomical invariances is proposed.

Result: The method achieves 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on test centers, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging, highlighting the need for specialized solutions for cross-sequence shifts.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

*Philip Wootaek Shin,Vishal Gaur,Rahul Ramachandran,Manil Maskey,Jack Sampson,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan,Sujit Roy*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A framework is proposed to align and harmonize 30m HLS imagery with 10m HLS data, improving super-resolution for heterogeneous satellite sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differences in spatial resolution and sensor characteristics hinder data fusion and downstream applications in satellite imagery.

Method: Develop a framework to align and harmonize 30m HLS imagery using 10m HLS data as a reference.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show improved super-resolved Landsat imagery.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates feasibility for heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and suggests future advancements.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

### [182] [LesionGen: A Concept-Guided Diffusion Model for Dermatology Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23001)
*Jamil Fayyad,Nourhan Bayasi,Ziyang Yu,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LesionGen, a text-to-image diffusion model, synthesizes realistic skin lesion images using structured dermatological captions, achieving classification accuracy comparable to real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited and poorly annotated skin disease datasets hinder deep learning models. Text-to-image diffusion models are promising but underexplored in dermatology due to lack of rich textual descriptions.

Method: LesionGen uses structured, concept-rich dermatological captions from expert annotations and pseudo-generated reports to fine-tune a pretrained diffusion model for realistic image synthesis.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data achieve accuracy comparable to real images, with improved worst-case subgroup performance.

Conclusion: LesionGen demonstrates the potential of structured text-to-image synthesis for addressing data scarcity in dermatology.

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a versatile, collaborative, and reproducible framework for MR image reconstruction, integrating both traditional and deep learning methods.

Method: MRpro includes unified data structures, a library of operators and algorithms, and deep learning building blocks, supported by automated quality control.

Result: Demonstrated versatility in applications like Cartesian, radial, and spiral acquisitions, motion correction, cardiac MR fingerprinting, and learned reconstruction.

Conclusion: MRpro is an extensible, maintainable framework that supports collaborative development and future MR imaging research.

Abstract: We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon
PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First,
it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR
datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it
offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and
optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common
trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These
components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key
reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential
building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization
layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets
to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project
supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro
across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral
acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting;
learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image
reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an
extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and
maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and
provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.

### [184] [Learning Arbitrary-Scale RAW Image Downscaling with Wavelet-based Recurrent Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23219)
*Yang Ren,Hai Jiang,Wei Li,Menglong Yang,Heng Zhang,Zehua Sheng,Qingsheng Ye,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A wavelet-based framework for RAW image downscaling, preserving details and avoiding artifacts, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sRGB downscaling methods blur details and introduce artifacts; RAW images lack specialized frameworks.

Method: Uses wavelet transformation with LASDM and HFPM modules, plus an energy-maximization loss, for coarse-to-fine downscaling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and visually.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively preserves RAW image quality during downscaling, supported by a new dataset.

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

### [185] [EMedNeXt: An Enhanced Brain Tumor Segmentation Framework for Sub-Saharan Africa using MedNeXt V2 with Deep Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23256)
*Ahmed Jaheen,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Damir Kim,Daniil Tikhonov,Matheus Scatolin,Mohor Banerjee,Qiankun Ji,Mostafa Salem,Hu Wang,Sarim Hashmi,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMedNeXt, an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework for sub-Saharan Africa, addressing challenges like low-quality MRI scans and scarce radiology expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI segmentation is time-consuming and unreliable in under-resourced regions, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: EMedNeXt improves MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision, optimized post-processing, a larger ROI, and nnU-Net v2-based architecture.

Result: Achieved high accuracy (LesionWise DSC 0.897, NSD 0.541/0.84 at 0.5mm/1.0mm tolerance) on validation data.

Conclusion: EMedNeXt offers a robust solution for tumor segmentation in resource-limited settings like SSA.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

*Huayu Fu,Jiamin Li,Haozhi Qu,Xiaolin Hu,Zengcai Guo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An improved framework for automatic segmentation of neuronal topology using deep learning, addressing challenges like occlusions and intricate morphology, with a novel evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling large-scale neuroimaging data requires efficient neuron annotation and analysis, but existing methods struggle with occlusions and complex neuronal structures.

Method: Proposes a deep network for pixel-level embedding vectors, an end-to-end pipeline for SWC-formatted trees, and a novel topological assessment metric.

Result: Significantly reduces error rates in neuronal topology reconstruction compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses segmentation challenges and improves reconstruction accuracy, validated by experiments on fMOST imaging data.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in
neuronal topology reconstruction.

*Oliver Bause,Julia Werner,Paul Palomero Bernardo,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN with 63K parameters achieves 93.06% accuracy on Bayer images for edge devices, saving 89.9% energy in medical capsule endoscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are often unsuitable for low-power edge devices due to large model sizes and RGB conversion overhead. This work targets energy-efficient AI for medical capsule endoscopy.

Method: Uses a CNN with 63K parameters and Viterbi decoding for time-series analysis, processing Bayer images directly. Implemented on a PULPissimo SoC with a RISC-V core and hardware accelerator.

Result: Achieves 93.06% accuracy with 5.31 µJ per image, saving 89.9% energy compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient AI-based image classification on resource-constrained devices, significantly improving energy savings in medical applications.

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi
decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image
processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a
RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an
energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardizing learning-based lossy compression while maintaining compatibility with JPEG.

Method: Incorporates neural operators in encoding and decoding stages to enhance performance.

Result: Improved chroma preservation, reconstruction fidelity, and reduced resource usage.

Conclusion: JPNeO offers a high-performance, out-of-the-box image compression solution without altering source coding protocols.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing
source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Continual learning (CL) enhances malaria CAD models' robustness to domain shifts, with rehearsal-based methods showing significant improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaria diagnosis in low-resource settings lacks expert microscopy, and existing CAD systems struggle with generalization across varying conditions.

Method: Investigates CL for domain-incremental learning using a YOLO-based object detector, evaluating four CL strategies on multi-site clinical data.

Result: CL, especially rehearsal-based methods, improves model performance across domains.

Conclusion: Continual learning can support deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

*Liu Li,Qiang Ma,Cheng Ouyang,Johannes C. Paetzold,Daniel Rueckert,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel fast approach for topology-aware medical image segmentation using the Euler Characteristic (χ) to improve topological correctness while maintaining pixel-wise accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based medical image segmentation methods often fail to meet clinical accuracy for topological constraints like continuous boundaries or closed surfaces, despite good conventional metrics.

Method: Proposes a fast χ computation for 2D/3D data, uses χ error as a topological metric, identifies violations via a topological violation map, and refines segmentation with a correction network.

Result: Experiments on 2D/3D datasets show significant improvement in topological correctness without compromising pixel-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses topological constraints in medical image segmentation, offering a practical solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A hybrid EEG-BCI and LLM framework for adaptive language rehabilitation in neurological conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AAC systems lack real-time adaptation to cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in conditions like aphasia or ALS.

Method: Combines EEG-based BCIs for neural intent detection with LLMs for tailored language content, enabling mental command navigation and dynamic personalization.

Result: Proposes a system for real-time language rehabilitation, personalized exercises, and adaptive task difficulty based on cognitive effort.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework offers a promising solution for adaptive language rehabilitation in neurological impairments.

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: An AI system guides users through stroke evaluations via voice, achieving 84% accuracy in identifying stroke signs and 75% in detecting LVOs, but requires human oversight due to some errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inconsistent and inaccurate stroke recognition by first responders, which causes dangerous treatment delays.

Method: AI system uses natural conversation and smartphone video to guide evaluations; tested by non-medical volunteers on simulated patients.

Result: 84% accuracy for stroke signs, 75% for LVOs; high user confidence but some false positives. Expert review improved diagnosis but not treatment decisions.

Conclusion: Human oversight is needed, but advancements in AI could enable highly accurate, expert-level assessments in emergency care.

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: An AI system (Doctronic) matched human clinicians in 81% of diagnoses and 99.2% in treatment plans, showing potential to address healthcare shortages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global shortage of healthcare practitioners and reduce administrative burden by evaluating an autonomous AI system in clinical practice.

Method: Retrospective comparison of Doctronic (a multi-agent LLM-based AI) and clinicians across 500 telehealth cases, assessing diagnostic concordance, treatment alignment, and safety.

Result: AI matched clinicians in 81% of diagnoses and 99.2% in treatments, with no hallucinations. AI outperformed humans in 36.1% of discordant cases.

Conclusion: Autonomous AI can match or exceed human clinical decision-making, offering a viable solution to workforce shortages.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A new method for automatic label placement (ALP) using LLMs, with a dataset (MAPLE) and retrieval-augmented prompts for context-aware spatial annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label placement is manual and hard to scale; existing automated systems lack context-awareness and adaptability.

Method: Formulates ALP as data editing, uses LLMs with retrieval-augmented prompts for context-aware annotation.

Result: LLMs with structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval achieve accurate spatial edits, matching expert standards.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable AI-assisted map finishing framework, showcasing LLMs' potential in structured data editing.

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

TL;DR: Accessibility Scout uses LLMs to provide personalized accessibility assessments of built environments from photos, balancing scalability with individual needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual accessibility assessments are labor-intensive and lack personalization, while automated methods often ignore individual user needs.

Method: Developed Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based system that scans photos of environments and tailors assessments to users' mobility, preferences, and interests through Human-AI collaboration.

Result: The system successfully generated personalized accessibility scans beyond traditional ADA standards, validated by technical and user studies.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for scalable, personalized accessibility assessments, with future steps to enhance the system.

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

*Jaeseok Park,Chanoh Park,Minsu Kim,Soohwan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GSFusion integrates LiDAR, inertial, and visual data for high-quality 3D mapping, addressing challenges like sparse data and alignment issues with innovative strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional 3DGS methods (e.g., computational load, poor performance in low-texture environments) and challenges of LiDAR integration (e.g., alignment, optimization time).

Method: Uses surfel-to-surfel constraints for global pose-graph optimization, pixel-aware Gaussian initialization, and bounded sigmoid constraints to manage sparse data.

Result: Outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in rendering quality and efficiency on public and custom datasets.

Conclusion: GSFusion provides a robust solution for high-precision, efficient 3D mapping by leveraging multi-sensor fusion and novel constraints.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

TL;DR: H-RDT leverages human manipulation data to improve robot manipulation, outperforming existing methods by 13.9% (simulation) and 40.5% (real-world).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of high-quality robot demonstration data by utilizing human manipulation videos for robotic policy learning.

Method: Two-stage training: pre-training on human data, then fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular encoders/decoders, using a diffusion transformer with flow matching.

Result: H-RDT outperforms training from scratch and state-of-the-art methods (Pi0, RDT) in simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Human manipulation data is a powerful foundation for learning bimanual robotic policies, validated by H-RDT's success.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Motivation: Addressing challenges like fragmented architectures, limited generalization, and insufficient semantic extraction in autonomous driving systems.

Method: A unified PLA framework combining multi-sensor fusion (cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a GPT-4.1-powered Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture for contextual reasoning and decision-making.

Result: Superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning in urban intersection scenarios with construction zones.

Conclusion: Language-augmented cognitive frameworks like PLA can improve safety, interpretability, and scalability in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

TL;DR: A Transformer-based model uses multimodal signals (facial expressions, voice) to estimate user experience (UX) in human-robot interaction, outperforming human evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate UX assessment in HRI is needed for adaptive robot behaviors, but existing methods focus narrowly on individual UX aspects.

Method: A Transformer-based model analyzes facial expressions and voice, capturing short- and long-term interaction patterns via multi-instance learning.

Result: The model surpasses human evaluators in UX estimation by capturing temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a holistic UX representation, improving adaptability in social robots.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

*Han Li,Yuling Shi,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Heng Lian,Xin Wang,Yantao Jia,Tao Huang,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Debate introduces a competitive multi-agent debate framework to improve issue resolution in software engineering by encouraging diverse reasoning paths and consolidated fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent-based issue resolution methods often get stuck in local solutions and miss broader issue patterns.

Method: SWE-Debate creates fault propagation traces, organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, and integrates a consolidated fix plan into an MCTS-based code modification agent.

Result: SWE-Debate achieves state-of-the-art results on the SWE-bench benchmark, outperforming baselines significantly.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of independent agent exploration by leveraging collaborative debate for better issue localization and resolution.

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Exp enhances LLM agents by distilling reusable repair experiences, improving issue resolution rates through continuous learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack memory, leading to redundant exploration and missed opportunities to reuse successful repair methods.

Method: Introduces a multi-faceted experience bank capturing successful and failed repair attempts, extracting reusable knowledge at various levels.

Result: Achieves 41.6% Pass@1 resolution rate on SWE-bench-Verified, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SWE-Exp shifts software engineering agents from trial-and-error to strategic, experience-driven issue resolution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a defense framework (SE+CFE) against blind prompt injection attacks in LLM-based evaluation systems, improving security with minimal trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in LLM-based evaluation systems, specifically against blind attacks where answers deceive evaluators independently of the truth.

Method: Augments Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), re-evaluating submissions against false ground-truth answers to detect attacks.

Result: SE+CFE significantly improves attack detection while maintaining performance, unlike standard evaluation which is highly vulnerable.

Conclusion: The SE+CFE framework effectively counters blind attacks, enhancing the security of LLM-based evaluation systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using LLMs (gpt-4o-mini) to analyze infection screenshots from infostealers like Aurora, extracting IoCs and mapping campaigns, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of infostealer logs is impractical at scale, and current research overlooks infection artifacts like screenshots.

Method: Leverages LLMs to analyze screenshots for IoCs (URLs, files, themes), correlating data to map campaigns.

Result: Extracted 337 URLs and 246 files from 1000 screenshots, identifying 3 distinct malware campaigns.

Conclusion: LLM-driven analysis of screenshots offers a scalable, reactive approach to enhance threat intelligence and early intervention.

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

### [206] [Noise-Coded Illumination for Forensic and Photometric Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23002)
*Peter F. Michael,Zekun Hao,Serge Belongie,Abe Davis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to embed subtle, noise-like modulations in scene illumination to create a temporal watermark in videos, making fake videos harder to create and easier to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of advanced video manipulation tools has made fake videos increasingly indistinguishable from real ones, favoring malicious actors. The paper aims to counteract this by creating an information asymmetry favoring verification.

Method: The approach involves coding subtle modulations into scene illumination, embedding a temporal watermark that captures the unmanipulated scene under coded lighting. This makes fake videos harder to forge.

Result: The method ensures that even if adversaries know the technique, creating plausible fake videos becomes significantly harder due to the added information disadvantage.

Conclusion: This technique is promising for high-stakes scenarios like public events, where controlled illumination can protect against video manipulation despite uncontrolled cameras.

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: XSpecMesh accelerates auto-regressive mesh generation by using speculative decoding and distillation, achieving 1.7x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-regressive models for mesh generation are slow due to sequential token predictions, requiring thousands of steps.

Method: XSpecMesh uses lightweight multi-head speculative decoding for parallel token prediction, verification, resampling, and distillation for alignment.

Result: Achieves 1.7x speedup while preserving mesh generation quality.

Conclusion: XSpecMesh effectively reduces latency in auto-regressive mesh generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

Method: ELMES uses a modular architecture for dynamic dialogues and a hybrid evaluation engine with LLM-as-a-Judge methodology.

Result: Benchmarking across four educational scenarios revealed distinct model capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: ELMES reduces barriers for LLM adoption in education and advances practical implementation.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative
opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.
However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially
across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack
appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure
general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular
architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues
through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design
without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a
hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective
pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic
benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational
scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,
Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question
Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with
education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability
distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and
limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible
evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse
educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs
in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at
\emph{https://github.com/sii-research/elmes.git}.
