We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding\ntasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,\nextracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other\nsummary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To\ndiagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation\npatching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a\nvariety of prompting strategies.

Both tasks remain\nchallenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,\nand occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years\nhave witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale\ndatasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated\nas an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with\ntiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.\nCross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views\nbased on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,\nreviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an\norganized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses\ncurrent limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising\ndirections for future research.

This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic\nand unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation\nmethods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective\nurban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:\nlow-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and\nhigh-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we\npropose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework\ndesigned for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy\nroute waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently\nplans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels\nof navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories\nparsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on\na mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety\nand adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA\nsurpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.\nFurthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both\nscalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world\nuncertainties.", "AI": {"tldr": "UrbanVLA is a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action framework for scalable urban navigation that aligns route waypoints with visual observations and plans trajectories, achieving 55%+ improvement in SocialNav tasks and reliable real-world performance.", "motivation": "Urban micromobility applications like delivery robots need reliable navigation in large-scale, dynamic urban environments, but existing methods are limited to short-scale controllable scenarios.
