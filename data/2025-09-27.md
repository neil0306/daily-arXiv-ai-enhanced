### [1] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework that modifies diplomatic event narratives to shift public sentiment from negative to neutral/positive using counterfactual generation with LLMs, achieving 70% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public sentiment is crucial for diplomacy but traditional sentiment analysis methods are time-consuming and lack predictive capability. There's a need for proactive tools to shape favorable public opinion.

Method: Train language model on diplomatic event descriptions and public discussions dataset. Use counterfactual generation algorithm with LLM to modify narrative framing while preserving core facts, guided by communication theories and domain experts.

Result: The framework successfully shifted public sentiment to more favorable states with 70% success rate.

Conclusion: This framework serves as practical tool for diplomats and policymakers, offering data-driven insights for framing diplomatic initiatives to foster desirable public sentiment.

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

### [2] [Speaker Style-Aware Phoneme Anchoring for Improved Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20373)
*Shreya G. Upadhyay,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework for cross-lingual speech emotion recognition that aligns emotional expression at phonetic and speaker levels using graph-based clustering and dual-space anchoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual SER is challenging due to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles across languages. There's a need to align emotion externalization across different speakers and languages.

Method: Builds emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture shared speaker traits, then applies dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces for better emotion transfer across languages.

Result: Evaluations on MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin) corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into commonalities in cross-lingual emotion representation and effectively addresses cross-lingual SER challenges.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong performance in general NLP tasks but their utility in automating complex physical system experiments like CFD remains underexplored, despite CFD being a critical and labor-intensive component of computational science.

Method: The benchmark comprises three components (CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, FoamBench) with a detailed task taxonomy and rigorous evaluation framework to test LLMs across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior.

Result: CFDLLMBench establishes a foundation for evaluating LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems, providing reproducible results.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a challenging testbed for assessing LLMs' scientific capabilities in CFD and enables development of automated numerical experiment systems for complex physical systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are

### [4] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates machine learning approaches for detecting ChatGPT-3.5 generated research abstracts versus human-written texts, finding DistilBERT performs best while ensemble methods don't outperform single transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT has blurred human-AI text boundaries, creating urgent needs for reliable AI-text detection to maintain academic integrity, protect intellectual property, and combat misinformation.

Method: Tested classical ML (Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words, POS, TF-IDF) and transformer-based approaches (BERT with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with custom classifier, LSTM-N-gram) on 250 abstract pairs across diverse research topics, including ensemble methods.

Result: DistilBERT achieved the best overall performance. Logistic Regression and BERT-Custom offered solid alternatives, while LSTM- and BERT-N-gram approaches performed poorly. Ensemble methods failed to surpass DistilBERT's individual performance.

Conclusion: Single transformer-based representations (like DistilBERT) outperform model diversity through ensembles. The study provides foundation for developing more robust detection frameworks to keep pace with advancing generative AI models.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

### [5] [ConceptViz: A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Concepts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20376)
*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConceptViz is a visual analytics system that bridges the gap between Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features and human-understandable concepts in LLMs through an identification-interpretation-validation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAE features extracted from LLMs don't naturally align with human concepts, making interpretation cumbersome and labor-intensive for researchers studying LLM knowledge representations.

Method: ConceptViz implements a novel pipeline: identification (querying SAEs using concepts), interpretation (interactive exploration of concept-to-feature alignments), and validation (model behavior verification).

Result: The system was evaluated through usage scenarios and user studies, showing enhanced interpretability research by streamlining concept discovery and validation in LLMs.

Conclusion: ConceptViz helps researchers build more accurate mental models of LLM features by making SAE-based concept representations more accessible and interpretable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

### [6] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG is a novel method that uses reinforcement learning to leverage LLMs' self-knowledge for filtering irrelevant retrieved documents in RAG systems, improving answer quality while reducing input documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval systems in RAG may return irrelevant content that causes hallucinations, so identifying and filtering unhelpful content is crucial. Understanding what the model "knows" and "doesn't know" (self-knowledge) is essential for better integrating internal and external knowledge.

Method: Proposes SKILL-RAG with reinforcement learning-based training to elicit self-knowledge from models, using sentence-level granularity to filter irrelevant content while preserving useful knowledge. Evaluated on Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B.

Result: Experimental results show SKILL-RAG improves generation quality and significantly reduces the number of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding high-quality retrieval selection.

Conclusion: SKILL-RAG demonstrates that leveraging models' self-knowledge through reinforcement learning effectively filters irrelevant retrieved content, enhancing RAG performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [7] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM is a fine-grained emotion modeling framework for text-to-speech that enables word-level emotion control using FiLM layers, addressing limitations of sentence-level emotion control approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing E-TTS systems use sentence-level control through predefined labels or reference audio, which fail to capture dynamic emotional shifts within sentences. There's a need for fine-grained emotion modeling to create more natural and expressive speech synthesis.

Method: The framework aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, then maps them through a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer to modulate text embeddings directly for word-level emotion control. A Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) was created for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that Emo-FiLM outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained emotion tasks, demonstrating effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM successfully addresses the limitation of dynamic emotional shifts in traditional E-TTS systems by enabling fine-grained word-level emotion control, providing more natural and trustworthy human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

### [8] [USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381)
*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: USB-Rec is an integrated training-inference framework that improves LLM performance in conversational recommender systems through preference optimization dataset construction and self-enhancement strategy at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for conversational recommender systems focus only on leveraging LLMs' summarization and analysis capabilities while ignoring training aspects, creating a gap in model-level performance improvement.

Method: Proposes USB-Rec framework with two key components: 1) LLM-based Preference Optimization dataset construction for RL training to help LLMs understand conversational recommendation strategies, and 2) Self-Enhancement Strategy at inference stage to further exploit conversational recommendation potential.

Result: Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that USB-Rec consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in conversational recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: The integrated training-inference framework effectively addresses the training gap in LLM-based conversational recommender systems and significantly improves performance through combined RL training and inference optimization strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

*Bruce Kuwahara,Chen-Yuan Lin,Xiao Shi Huang,Kin Kwan Leung,Jullian Arta Yapeter,Ilya Stanevich,Felipe Perez,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Conformal Importance Summarization is a framework that provides rigorous coverage guarantees for critical content in automatic summarization using conformal prediction, enabling reliable summarization in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based summarization systems lack reliable guarantees for including critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance, creating deployment risks.

Method: The framework uses conformal prediction to calibrate thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, enabling extractive summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. It's model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set, and integrates with existing black-box LLMs.

Result: Experiments on established summarization benchmarks show that Conformal Importance Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate.

Conclusion: The framework can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, enabling safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical applications.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

### [11] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS is a role-based multi-agent framework that improves reasoning efficiency by simulating a review process, reducing token usage and inference time by 50% while maintaining accuracy comparable to Multi-Agent Debate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) improves LLM reasoning but introduces substantial computational overhead due to frequent agent interactions. There's a need for more efficient collaborative reasoning frameworks.

Method: MARS uses a review-inspired process with three roles: author agent generates initial solution, reviewer agents provide independent feedback, and meta-reviewer integrates feedback for final decision and revision guidance.

Result: MARS matches MAD's accuracy while reducing token usage and inference time by approximately 50% across multiple benchmarks with different LLMs.

Conclusion: MARS provides an efficient alternative to MAD by eliminating costly reviewer-to-reviewer interactions while maintaining reasoning quality, offering practical benefits for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

TL;DR: SiniticMTError is a novel dataset for machine translation error analysis, providing error span, type, and severity annotations for English to Mandarin, Cantonese, and Wu Chinese translations, with a focus on low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in machine translation remains limited for low-resource languages like Cantonese and Wu Chinese, which lack large-scale training data and linguistic resources despite having millions of speakers.

Method: The authors built on existing parallel corpora and conducted rigorous annotation by native speakers, including error span, type, and severity annotations, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement and iterative feedback.

Result: The dataset serves as a resource for fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and low-resource language evaluation.

Conclusion: SiniticMTError provides a valuable resource for the MT community to advance research in error detection and quality estimation for low-resource Sinitic languages.

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM is a unified zero-shot cross-lingual framework for medical diagnosis that works across English, Hindi, and Bengali without language-specific fine-tuning, achieving high accuracy in both supervised and zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of disease diagnosis in multilingual healthcare environments where annotated medical data is scarce in low-resource languages and linguistic variability exists across populations.

Method: Uses XLM-RoBERTa encoder with language-aware attention, Siamese contrastive learning for cross-lingual semantic alignment, translation consistency module, and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for rapid adaptation. Employs multi-task learning combining disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves 97.22% accuracy and 97.17% F1-score in supervised settings. In zero-shot scenarios: 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% on Bengali medical text.

Conclusion: SwasthLLM demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for multilingual medical diagnosis, particularly effective in low-resource contexts without requiring language-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

### [14] [Dynamic Reasoning Chains through Depth-Specialized Mixture-of-Experts in Transformer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20577)
*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DS-MoE introduces depth-specialized mixture of experts that dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains based on input complexity, achieving computational savings and improved reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformers apply identical processing depth to all inputs, creating inefficiencies where simple queries get same computation as complex problems, wasting resources and limiting reasoning quality.

Method: Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE) with expert modules optimized for distinct reasoning depths (shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical inference, memory integration, meta-cognitive supervision) and a learned routing network that dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains.

Result: 16% computational savings, 35% faster inference compared to uniform-depth transformers, and 2.8% higher accuracy on complex multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Routing decisions provide interpretable reasoning chains.

Conclusion: DS-MoE establishes depth-specialized modular processing as a significant advancement that simultaneously improves efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in large-scale language models.

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRT is a hierarchical transformer architecture that processes language at multiple resolutions using wavelet-inspired attention, achieving O(nlogn) complexity and outperforming standard transformers on major benchmarks while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers misrepresent language hierarchy by processing text as flat token sequences, leading to quadratic computational cost, weak compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling.

Method: HRT constructs multi-resolution attention with exponential sequence reduction across scales, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down contextualization through wavelet-inspired neural processing.

Result: HRT outperforms standard transformers by +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to similar-sized BERT/GPT models.

Conclusion: HRT is the first architecture to align computational structure with language hierarchy, demonstrating that multi-scale wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

### [16] [FS-DFM: Fast and Accurate Long Text Generation with Few-Step Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20624)
*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM is a discrete flow-matching model that enables high-quality language generation with only 8 sampling steps, achieving 128x faster sampling than traditional 1,024-step discrete-flow models while maintaining perplexity parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models are serial and slow for long sequences, while diffusion language models require hundreds to thousands of steps for high quality. There's a need for faster generation without sacrificing quality.

Method: Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching makes sampling steps an explicit parameter, trains for consistency across step budgets, uses reliable update rules to prevent overshooting, and employs strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories.

Result: FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with 1,024-step discrete-flow baselines for generating 1,024 tokens, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and corresponding latency/throughput improvements.

Conclusion: FS-DFM enables efficient few-step sampling that is stable, accurate, and controllable, making discrete flow-matching practical for high-throughput language generation applications.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

*Jungsoo Park,Ethan Mendes,Gabriel Stanovsky,Alan Ritter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRECOG, a method for forecasting language model performance from redacted task descriptions without running experiments, showing moderate prediction accuracy with well-calibrated uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the evaluation bottleneck in large language model development by enabling performance forecasting before running costly experiments.

Method: Curated PRECOG corpus of redacted description-performance pairs, used retrieval-equipped models to predict scores from task descriptions and configurations without dataset access.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds; stronger models showed diverse iterative querying while open-source models lagged.

Conclusion: The approach offers initial steps toward anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization in language model development.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents methods for building Japanese speech recognizers that output phonemic labels with accent markers for speaking assessment tasks, using multitask learning and fusion techniques to overcome data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Japanese lacks sufficient training data for accurate phonemic transcriptions with accent marks, despite being resource-rich in general. The goal is to create specialized speech recognizers for Japanese speaking assessment that can produce precise phonemic labels.

Method: Two main approaches: 1) Multitask training with auxiliary loss functions for orthographic text labels and pitch patterns to leverage utterances with only orthographic annotations; 2) Fusion of phonetic alphabet and text token sequence estimators using a finite-state transducer framework algorithm.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improved accuracy, reducing average mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% on CSJ core evaluation sets. The approach outperformed generic multilingual recognizers.

Conclusion: Multitask learning and fusion techniques are effective for building accurate Japanese phonemic recognizers, successfully addressing data sparsity issues and providing advantages over generic solutions for speaking assessment tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

*Peng Zhou,Lai Hou Tim,Zhixiang Cheng,Kun Xie,Chaoyi Li,Wei Liu,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework that integrates LLM-derived knowledge with structural features from pre-trained molecular models to enhance molecular property prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GNNs and self-supervised learning have advanced molecular property prediction, LLMs face knowledge gaps and hallucinations for less-studied properties. Integrating human prior knowledge with structural features is crucial for robust prediction.

Method: Proposes a framework that prompts LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1) to generate domain knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, then fuses these knowledge-based features with structural representations from pre-trained models.

Result: Extensive experiments show the integrated method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating that combining LLM-derived knowledge with structural information provides effective MPP solutions.

Conclusion: The integration of LLM-extracted knowledge with structural features creates a robust framework that significantly enhances molecular property prediction performance.

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedHerring is a novel attack that makes attack detection models unreliable by modifying text to trigger false attack detections while keeping the classifier correct, creating tension between classifier and detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the reliability of attack detection models in NLP systems, which have not been thoroughly explored despite their importance in providing additional security checks and human input signals.

Method: Proposes RedHerring attack that modifies text to cause detection models to predict an attack while maintaining classifier accuracy. Tests on 4 datasets against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers.

Result: RedHerring drops detection accuracy by 20-71 points while maintaining or improving classifier accuracy. A simple confidence check defense is proposed that requires no retraining and greatly increases detection accuracy.

Conclusion: This novel threat model reveals vulnerabilities in attack detection systems and provides new insights into how adversaries can target detection models, highlighting the need for more robust defense mechanisms.

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid and Dynamic Select strategies to reduce query costs in adversarial text attacks on NLP models by combining BinarySelect and GreedySelect algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models have high computational costs for attack testing, and existing black-box methods require too many queries, making them inefficient for resource-limited researchers.

Method: Hybrid Select combines BinarySelect and GreedySelect using a size threshold. Dynamic Select learns which selection method to apply to different text lengths.

Result: Reduces queries by up to 25.82% on average across 4 datasets and 6 models while maintaining attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies significantly improve efficiency of adversarial text attacks without compromising performance, making attack testing more accessible.

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse is a denoised label fusion framework that adapts student models to outperform large audio-language models (LALMs) in cross-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) using only unlabeled target-domain data and API-only LALM access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world SER deployments often fail due to domain mismatch, where source data is unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through APIs. The goal is to adapt student models to outperform LALMs in target domains without sharing source data.

Method: MI-Fuse supplements the LALM with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. It draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher.

Result: Experiments across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.9%.

Conclusion: This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation to target domains under domain mismatch conditions.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Motivation: Existing unsupervised neural grammar induction models suffer from expressiveness bottlenecks, leading to unnecessarily large yet underperforming grammars due to probability distribution collapse.

Method: The authors analyze when and how probability distribution collapse emerges in neural parameterization components and introduce a targeted collapse-relaxing neural parameterization solution to mitigate this issue.

Result: The proposed approach substantially improves parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive empirical analysis.

Conclusion: Addressing probability distribution collapse through targeted neural parameterization enables more efficient and effective unsupervised grammar induction with compact yet high-performing grammars.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability

when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive

TL;DR: C2R is a training-free framework that uses confidence-guided refinement reasoning for QA tasks across text, image, and video domains by constructing and refining sub-questions and answers to improve answer selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance question-answering performance across multiple domains without requiring additional training, by leveraging the model's own confidence scores through strategic sub-question refinement.

Method: C2R curates subsets of sub-QAs to explore diverse reasoning paths, compares confidence scores of answer candidates, and selects the most reliable final answer based solely on the model's internal confidence metrics.

Result: The framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks, and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing QA models.

Conclusion: C2R provides valuable insights into how sub-QA quantity and quality affect model reasoning behavior, enabling more robust and reliable QA systems without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: SFT with smaller learning rates can mitigate general capability degradation while maintaining domain performance. TALR method outperforms other strategies in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between domain adaptation and general capability preservation in LLM fine-tuning, challenging the belief that SFT always degrades general performance.

Method: Empirical analysis of learning rate effects, theoretical analysis leading to Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR), and comparative evaluation of various strategies including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, and FLOW.

Result: Smaller learning rates substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving target-domain performance. TALR consistently outperforms other methods in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines: (i) use small learning rates for favorable trade-off, (ii) adopt TALR when stronger balance is needed. No method completely eliminates the trade-off but TALR provides the best balance.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Atoms Theory to define fundamental representation units in LLMs, addressing limitations of neurons and features. It introduces atomic inner product for representation correction and proves theoretical guarantees for sparse representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using neurons or features as representation units have limitations - neurons suffer from polysemy, while features face unreliable reconstruction and instability. There's a need for better-defined fundamental units to understand LLM mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Atoms Theory with atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting. Uses threshold-activated sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B models to validate the theory.

Result: Achieved 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers on average, with over 99.8% of atoms satisfying uniqueness condition (vs 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features). Scaling experiments show link between SAEs size and recovery capacity.

Conclusion: Atoms Theory provides a systematic framework for understanding LLM internal representations, showing atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations than neurons or features, establishing foundation for mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

### [27] [Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20805)
*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Conversational Prompting is a lightweight method for personalized review generation that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn conversations, addressing few-shot and training-free scenarios where only limited user reviews are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized review generation approaches assume extensive user review histories or require additional model training, but real-world applications often face few-shot and training-free constraints where only a few user reviews are available and fine-tuning is infeasible.

Method: Proposes Conversational Prompting with two variants: Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP) uses only the user's own reviews, while Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP) inserts reviews from other users or LLMs as incorrect replies and asks the model to correct them to encourage text generation in the user's style.

Result: Experiments on eight product domains and five LLMs showed that conventional non-conversational prompts produced reviews similar to random users, while both SCP and CCP produced reviews much closer to the target user's style, even with only two reviews per user. CCP provides further improvements with high-quality negative examples.

Conclusion: Conversational prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and training-free constraints, with SCP remaining competitive when negative examples cannot be collected.

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks like KGQA due to semantic gaps between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured queries.

Method: Proposes Enrich-on-Graph (EoG) framework that leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, enabling efficient evidence extraction and precise reasoning while maintaining low computational costs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two KGQA benchmark datasets, effectively generating high-quality KGs with improved query-graph alignment.

Conclusion: EoG provides a scalable and adaptable solution for bridging semantic gaps in KGQA, with theoretical validation and practical effectiveness demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

### [29] [Leveraging What's Overfixed: Post-Correction via LLM Grammatical Error Overcorrection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20811)
*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO is a novel approach that combines LLMs' overcorrection tendency with sLMs' precision to improve grammatical error correction by first maximizing recall via LLM overcorrection, then refining outputs with targeted post-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between sLMs (high precision, low recall) and LLMs (high recall, low precision) in grammatical error correction, by strategically balancing both aspects.

Method: PoCO first uses LLMs to intentionally overcorrect and maximize recall, then applies a post-correction step using fine-tuned smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall while maintaining competitive precision, improving overall correction quality.

Conclusion: PoCO successfully harmonizes LLMs' generative power with sLMs' reliability, achieving better balance in grammatical error correction performance.

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cheat-sheet ICL: distills many-shot in-context learning into concise textual summaries to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational demands of many-shot in-context learning in LLMs by reducing input token length while preserving effectiveness

Method: Propose cheat-sheet ICL that distills information from many-shot examples into concise textual summaries (cheat sheets) used as context during inference

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches retrieval-based ICL without test-time retrieval

Conclusion: Cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs in downstream tasks, offering efficiency gains without performance loss

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

*Shuo Huang,Xingliang Yuan,Gholamreza Haffari,Lizhen Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A zero-shot tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm for privacy-preserving text anonymization that outperforms existing methods in balancing privacy protection and utility preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with LLM cloud services where user inputs may expose sensitive information, and existing anonymization techniques struggle to balance privacy with text naturalness and utility.

Method: Zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness through structured search guided by a reward model.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines on privacy-sensitive datasets, achieving superior balance between privacy protection and utility preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses privacy concerns in LLM applications by providing a dynamic approach to text anonymization that maintains text quality while protecting sensitive information.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

*Guo Chen,Qiuyuan Li,Qiuxian Li,Hongliang Dai,Xiang Chen,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes sub-sentence citations for RAG systems to improve verifiability by providing more precise and sufficient attribution than sentence-level citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing citation methods in RAG systems suffer from two problems: (1) sentence/paragraph-level citations include irrelevant content, and (2) they may omit essential verification information, forcing users to read surrounding context.

Method: Develops annotation guidelines for sub-sentence citations, constructs a dataset, and proposes an attribution framework using LLMs to generate fine-tuning data with a credit model to filter low-quality examples.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the approach generates high-quality and more readable citations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Sub-sentence citations provide more concise and sufficient attribution, reducing user effort in verifying LLM outputs in RAG question answering systems.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeFT is a weighted supervised fine-tuning method for diffusion language models that assigns different weights to tokens based on their entropy, achieving significant improvements over standard SFT on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise for language modeling with faster generation, but applying supervised fine-tuning is challenging due to lack of precise probability estimates at each denoising step and inconsistent generation processes. Controlling key tokens that guide generation direction is crucial.

Method: Proposes WeFT, a weighted SFT method where tokens are assigned different weights based on their entropy, derived from diffusion theory.

Result: WeFT achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard SFT on Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500 benchmarks when trained on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from open-r1.

Conclusion: The proposed WeFT method effectively addresses SFT challenges in diffusion language models by weighting tokens according to entropy, delivering substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

### [34] [Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20866)
*Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Natpatchara Pongjirapat,Krittaphas Chaisutyakorn,Piyalitt Ittichaiwong,Tossaporn Saengja,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates enabling medical reasoning models to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended medical questions, proposing both prompting and fine-tuning approaches with new reward functions for reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making typically considers multiple options rather than single answers to avoid narrow perspectives, but current medical reasoning models are trained to produce only one answer even in open-ended settings.

Method: The study explores two approaches: prompting (cost-effective steering) and fine-tuning (supervised and reinforcement). It proposes new reward functions specifically for ranked-list formats and conducts ablation studies for reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: While some supervised fine-tuning models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with reinforcement fine-tuning are more robust across multiple formats. Models can recognize valid answers even when they fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling medical reasoning models to generate ranked lists, providing a foundation for developing alternative answer formats that benefit medical domains beyond single-answer limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SummQ is a novel adversarial multi-agent framework for long document summarization that uses collaborative intelligence between summarization and quizzing agents to address information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with long document summarization due to information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence problems when processing excessively long documents.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework with summary generators/reviewers and quiz generators/reviewers working collaboratively. An examinee agent validates if summaries contain information to answer quiz questions, enabling iterative refinement through adversarial feedback.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks across ROUGE, BERTScore, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Establishes a new approach for long document summarization using adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality through multifaceted feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemLens detects LLM memorization by analyzing probability trajectories of numeric tokens, showing contaminated samples exhibit early confidence locking while clean samples show gradual evidence accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods based on lexical overlap and perplexity have low generalization and perform poorly on implicitly contaminated data, requiring a more robust memorization detection approach.

Method: Proposes MemLens which analyzes probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation, revealing that contaminated samples show shortcut behaviors with early confidence locking, while clean samples demonstrate gradual evidence accumulation across model layers.

Result: Contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct, well-separated reasoning trajectories. Validation through LoRA fine-tuning with injected samples shows the same trajectory patterns as naturally contaminated data.

Conclusion: MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations, providing a robust method for detecting contamination in LLM benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

*Krishna Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by structural density of intervening material, proposing Intervener Complexity as a refined measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality in sentence processing by testing whether structural density (number of intervening heads) offers better explanatory power for memory load than linear distance alone.

Method: Used harmonized dependency treebanks and mixed-effects modeling across multiple languages to evaluate sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of memory load, operationalized as the sum of feature misbinding and interference.

Result: All three factors were positively associated with memory load, with sentence length having the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity providing explanatory power beyond linear distance measures.

Conclusion: The findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives by treating dependency length as a surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration demands, demonstrating how UD-based graph measures can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency.

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates tool calling capabilities for Arabic language LLMs, examining the need for Arabic-specific data vs cross-lingual transfer, the impact of instruction tuning, and the value of fine-tuning on specific tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool calling research is predominantly English-centric, creating a gap for other languages like Arabic. The paper aims to understand how to enable tool calling functionality for Arabic LLMs.

Method: Extensive experiments using base and post-trained variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM, with translated and adapted tool-calling datasets from English to Arabic.

Result: The study provides insights into optimal strategies for developing tool-augmented agents for Arabic, addressing three key research questions about data requirements and training approaches.

Conclusion: The findings offer crucial guidance for building robust Arabic tool-calling capabilities, bridging the resource gap through dataset translation and adaptation.

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

TL;DR: This paper investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics, proposing five evaluation methods and finding Reference Aided Evaluation as the most effective approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can serve as automatic evaluators for academic text-input problems in education, building on existing research about LLMs as educational assistants and evaluators.

Method: Proposed five evaluation systems (JudgeLM, Reference Aided, No Reference, Additive, and Adaptive Evaluation) tested on a custom dataset of 110 computer science answers from higher education students using three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.

Result: Reference Aided Evaluation performed best with lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and root mean square deviation (1.214) compared to human evaluation. Other methods showed limitations in handling concise answers or lacked necessary information for proper assessment.

Conclusion: AI-driven automatic evaluation systems, when aided with proper methodologies like Reference Aided Evaluation, show potential as complementary tools to academic resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The causal mask in Transformer decoders provides positional information and induces position-dependent attention patterns that favor nearby query-key pairs, similar to explicit positional encodings. The interaction between causal mask and RoPE distorts relative attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the causal mask (not just explicit positional encodings) contributes positional information in Transformer decoders, and understand its interaction with methods like RoPE.

Method: Theoretical analysis of causal mask effects on attention patterns, combined with empirical analysis of trained models to observe how learned parameters amplify these patterns.

Result: Causal mask induces position-dependent attention favoring nearby pairs, and its interaction with RoPE distorts relative attention patterns into non-relative ones. This effect is consistently observed in modern large language models.

Conclusion: The causal mask should be considered as an important source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings, as it significantly impacts attention patterns and interacts with methods like RoPE.

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two benchmarks (ManyIFEval and StyleMBPP) to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously, showing performance degrades with more instructions, and develops regression models that can predict performance on unseen instruction combinations with ~10% error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in real-world scenarios, it's crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously, which is computationally impractical to evaluate exhaustively.

Method: Created two specialized benchmarks: ManyIFEval for text generation (up to 10 instructions) and StyleMBPP for code generation (up to 6 instructions). Developed three types of regression models to estimate performance on unseen instruction combinations, with logistic regression using instruction count as key variable.

Result: Performance consistently degrades as number of instructions increases across ten tested LLMs. A logistic regression model can predict performance with approximately 10% error even for unseen instruction combinations, requiring modest sample sizes (500 for ManyIFEval, 300 for StyleMBPP).

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarks and regression models enable efficient evaluation of LLMs' multi-instruction following capabilities, with practical sample sizes making comprehensive evaluation feasible despite the combinatorial explosion of possible instruction combinations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Motivation: Foundation models have shown strong capabilities but their performance on complex multimodal engineering problems remains unexplored, particularly in scientific domains like strength of materials.

Method: Created SoM-1K dataset with 1,065 annotated problems containing text and diagrams, proposed Descriptions of Images (DoI) prompting strategy, and evaluated 8 foundation models including LLMs and VLMs.

Result: Current foundation models perform poorly on engineering problems (best model: 56.6% accuracy), with LLMs using DoI often outperforming VLMs using visual diagrams. DoI significantly reduces visual misinterpretation errors.

Conclusion: This work establishes a rigorous engineering AI benchmark and highlights the need for more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models for scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [44] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit culture positioning bias by defaulting to mainstream US perspectives and treating other cultures as outsiders. The paper proposes CultureLens benchmark and agent-based mitigation methods to address this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from mainstream US perspectives while demonstrating bias towards non-mainstream cultures.

Method: Proposed CultureLens benchmark with 4000 prompts and 3 metrics for evaluating culture bias through interview script generation. Developed two mitigation methods: FIP (prompt-based) and MFA framework with single-agent (self-reflection) and multi-agent (specialized agents) pipelines.

Result: Evaluation on 5 LLMs revealed models adopt insider tones in 88% of US contexts but outsider stances for less dominant cultures. Agent-based mitigation methods showed effectiveness in reducing bias.

Conclusion: Agent-based methods are a promising direction for mitigating cultural biases in generative LLMs, addressing the identified culture positioning bias through structured intervention frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

### [45] [PerHalluEval: Persian Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21104)
*Mohammad Hosseini,Kimia Hosseini,Shayan Bali,Zahra Zanjani,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval is the first Persian-language benchmark for evaluating hallucination in LLMs, using a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline with human validation to detect extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations in QA and summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination is a persistent issue in LLMs, particularly affecting low-resource languages like Persian, which lack dedicated evaluation benchmarks.

Method: A three-stage LLM-driven pipeline augmented with human validation to generate plausible answers and summaries, using log probabilities to select believable hallucinated instances, and human annotation for Persian-specific cultural contexts.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs showed they struggle with detecting hallucinated Persian text. External knowledge (original documents) partially mitigates hallucination, and Persian-specific training showed no significant advantage.

Conclusion: LLMs generally perform poorly on Persian hallucination detection, and specialized training for Persian does not significantly improve hallucination resistance compared to general models.

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

### [46] [BESPOKE: Benchmark for Search-Augmented Large Language Model Personalization via Diagnostic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21106)
*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE is a realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in search-augmented LLMs, addressing the gap in systematic evaluation of how LLMs can adapt to diverse user intents and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search-augmented LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini attempt personalization but lack systematic evaluation. The same query can reflect different intents across users, requiring personalized information delivery in preferred forms.

Method: BESPOKE collects authentic chat and search histories directly from humans through long-term, deeply engaged annotation. Annotators contribute their own histories, author queries with detailed information needs, and evaluate responses with fine-grained preference scores and diagnostic feedback.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic analysis of key requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks, providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized search-augmented LLMs.

Conclusion: BESPOKE offers a realistic and diagnostic framework for advancing personalized information retrieval in LLMs, with publicly available code and data to support future research.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [47] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ is a spoken extension of the BBQ benchmark that measures social bias in Spoken Language Models (SLMs) by converting text contexts into controlled voice conditions, enabling evaluation of both content and acoustic bias sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual sources of social bias in SLMs - content and acoustic aspects - which can emerge differently in speech compared to text, requiring specialized evaluation methods.

Method: Converted every BBQ context into controlled voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores comparable to the original text benchmark. Evaluated two SLMs (LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio) using this framework.

Result: Found architectural contrasts: LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias but amplifies gender and accent bias, while Qwen2-Audio dampens these cues while preserving content fidelity.

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models, revealing important architectural differences in bias handling.

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [48] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechLMs exhibit paradoxical gender bias patterns: they show male-oriented responses in gender-stereotypical questions but gender-independent responses in gender-dependent questions where gender differentiation would be appropriate, primarily due to Whisper speech encoders generating male-oriented acoustic tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze acoustic-based gender differentiation in SpeechLMs where identical questions lead to different responses based on speaker's gender, revealing biases despite models prioritizing general fairness principles.

Method: Created a new dataset of 9,208 speech samples across three categories (Gender-Independent, Gender-Stereotypical, Gender-Dependent) and evaluated LLaMA-Omni series models, testing with neutral options, gender neutralization methods, and comparing SpeechLMs with backbone LLMs.

Result: Models consistently exhibited male-oriented responses in Gender-Stereotypical questions but gender-independent responses in Gender-Dependent questions. The pattern persists with neutral options and gender neutralization, primarily stemming from Whisper speech encoders generating male-oriented acoustic tokens.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLMs fail to properly utilize gender information, prioritizing general fairness over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more sophisticated techniques to handle gender information in speech technology.

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

### [50] [Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151)
*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROC reformulates multimodal relation extraction as a retrieval task using semantic similarity instead of classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance with better robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal relation extraction approaches use classification with fused features, which overlook structural constraints like entity types/position and lack semantic expressiveness for fine-grained understanding.

Method: ROC integrates entity type/position information via multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language descriptions using LLM, and aligns entity-relation pairs through semantic similarity-based contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNRE and MORE benchmark datasets, demonstrating stronger robustness and interpretability compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: Retrieval-based paradigm outperforms classification-based approaches for multimodal relation extraction by better capturing structural constraints and semantic expressiveness.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

### [51] [Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntactic-Domain Spurious Correlations in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21155)
*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs develop spurious correlations between syntactic templates and domains, which can override semantic understanding and affect model performance and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how syntactic patterns in training data create unintended associations that can compromise LLM performance on entity knowledge tasks and bypass safety mechanisms.

Method: Used synthetic training datasets to study syntactic-domain correlations, developed an evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon, and conducted case studies on safety finetuning vulnerabilities.

Result: Found that syntactic-domain correlations lower performance on entity knowledge tasks (mean 0.51 +/- 0.06) and can be used to bypass refusals in both open (OLMo-2-7B, Llama-4-Maverick) and closed (GPT-4o) models.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations and ensure syntactic diversity in training data within domains to prevent spurious correlations that affect model reliability and safety.

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

TL;DR: This paper surveys computational humor in NLP, focusing on humor generation and explanation tasks, and identifies gaps in current research while discussing future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern LLMs through humor understanding, which requires extensive reasoning and is context-dependent.

Method: Literature survey of computational humor research, particularly focusing on generative tasks of humor creation and explanation beyond puns.

Result: Current work on generating and explaining humor remains sparse, and state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human capabilities despite humor understanding being a foundational NLP task.

Conclusion: Computational humor processing is an important NLP subdiscipline that needs more research, considering the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humor.

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

### [53] [GEP: A GCG-Based method for extracting personally identifiable information from chatbots built on small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21192)
*Jieli Zhu,Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates PII (personally identifiable information) leakage in small language models (SLMs) and proposes GEP, a greedy coordinate gradient-based method for effective PII extraction that significantly outperforms previous template-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models are becoming increasingly popular due to their comparable performance to large models with lower computational costs, but their PII leakage risks in downstream tasks remain unexplored, creating a critical security gap that needs investigation.

Method: The researchers first fine-tuned ChatBioGPT based on BioGPT using medical datasets, then developed GEP - a greedy coordinate gradient-based method specifically designed for PII extraction in SLMs, testing it against template-based methods and in free-style insertion scenarios.

Result: GEP demonstrated up to 60× more PII leakage compared to template-based methods, and maintained a 4.53% leakage rate even in complex free-style insertion scenarios where PII was expressed in various syntactic forms rather than fixed templates.

Conclusion: SLMs are vulnerable to PII leakage attacks, and the proposed GEP method effectively exposes these vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for improved privacy protection measures in small language model deployments, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework combining implicit retrieval and structured collaboration that addresses bottlenecks in LLM scientific reasoning by reducing token usage and improving accuracy through hierarchical solution refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face two major bottlenecks in scientific reasoning: explicit retrieval fragments reasoning (imposing 'tool tax') and multi-agent pipelines dilute strong solutions through averaging across candidates.

Method: Uses Monitor-based retrieval at token level for minimal disruption, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) where candidates repair each other, and Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) that adapts refinement to solution quality.

Result: Achieves 48.3% accuracy on Humanity's Last Exam Bio/Chem Gold (highest reported), surpassing strongest baseline by 13.4 points, reducing token usage by 53.5% and agent steps by 43.7%. Results confirmed on SuperGPQA and TRQA.

Conclusion: Implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation, with findings showing reasoning failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in 85%+ cases, and retrieval benefits from diversity while reasoning favors consensus.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLaw is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Chinese legal knowledge, consisting of a comprehensive statute corpus and case-based reasoning tasks, revealing significant deficiencies in LLMs' ability to accurately retrieve and apply legal provisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for legal analysis but their reliability is compromised by general pre-training that lacks specialized legal focus, obscuring their true legal knowledge depth.

Method: Introduces CLaw benchmark with two components: (1) fine-grained corpus of 306 Chinese statutes segmented to subparagraph level with historical revisions (64,849 entries), and (2) 254 case-based reasoning instances from Supreme Court materials.

Result: Most contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal provisions, critically undermining their legal reasoning reliability due to poor retrieval and citation accuracy.

Conclusion: Trustworthy legal reasoning requires robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval (enhanced via SFT or RAG) and strong general reasoning capabilities. CLaw provides essential benchmark for advancing domain-specific LLM reasoning in legal sphere.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

TL;DR: SGMem (Sentence Graph Memory) is a novel memory management system for long-term conversational agents that organizes dialogue as sentence-level graphs across different granularities to improve context retrieval and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory methods based on fact extraction or summarization struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across different dialogue granularities in long-term conversations that exceed LLM context windows.

Method: SGMem represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and session-level contexts, and combines retrieved raw dialogue with generated memory (summaries, facts, insights).

Result: Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks show SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Conclusion: SGMem effectively supplies LLMs with coherent and relevant context for response generation in long-term conversational settings.

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

TL;DR: QCG-RAG introduces a query-centric graph framework for RAG that solves the granularity dilemma by enabling query-granular indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval, outperforming existing methods in multi-hop reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods face a granularity dilemma where fine-grained entity-level graphs have high token costs and lose context, while coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations.

Method: QCG-RAG uses Doc2Query and Doc2Query-- to construct query-centric graphs with controllable granularity, followed by a tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism that selects relevant chunks via generated queries.

Result: Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG datasets show QCG-RAG consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in question answering accuracy.

Conclusion: QCG-RAG establishes a new paradigm for multi-hop reasoning by providing improved graph quality and interpretability through query-centric graph construction.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

### [58] [Un-Doubling Diffusion: LLM-guided Disambiguation of Homonym Duplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21262)
*Evgeny Kaskov,Elizaveta Petrova,Petr Surovtsev,Anna Kostikova,Ilya Mistiurin,Alexander Kapitanov,Alexander Nagaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses homonym duplication in diffusion models, where words with identical spelling but different meanings cause models to generate multiple senses simultaneously. The issue is exacerbated by Anglocentric bias in translation pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homonyms pose challenges for generative models, leading to ambiguous outputs. The problem is complicated by translation biases that create artificial homonyms from non-English languages, causing meaning loss in text-to-image generation.

Method: The authors introduce a method for measuring duplication rates and evaluate diffusion models using both automatic evaluation with Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. They also investigate prompt expansion as a mitigation technique.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that homonym duplication is a significant issue in diffusion models. Prompt expansion is shown to effectively reduce duplication rates, including those related to Anglocentric bias.

Conclusion: Homonym duplication is a critical problem in text-to-image generation that can be mitigated through prompt expansion techniques. The automatic evaluation pipeline is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

### [59] [LLM Output Homogenization is Task Dependent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21267)
*Shomik Jain,Jack Lanchantin,Maximilian Nickel,Karen Ullrich,Ashia Wilson,Jamelle Watson-Daniels*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses output homogenization in LLMs by proposing a task-dependent approach to diversity evaluation and mitigation, challenging the diversity-quality trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to output homogenization fail to account for task-specific diversity requirements, where homogenization may be desirable in some tasks (e.g., math) but problematic in others (e.g., creative writing).

Method: The authors propose: (1) a task taxonomy with 8 categories having distinct homogenization conceptualizations, (2) task-anchored functional diversity evaluation, (3) task-anchored sampling technique, and (4) demonstrating increased diversity without quality loss.

Result: The paper shows that task-dependent approaches can better evaluate and mitigate output homogenization while maintaining response quality.

Conclusion: Task dependence is crucial for properly evaluating and addressing output homogenization in LLMs, and the perceived diversity-quality trade-off can be overcome with appropriate task-anchored methods.

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

*Irina Tolstykh,Aleksandra Tsybina,Sergey Yakubson,Maksim Kuprashevich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMTrace is a new bilingual corpus for AI-generated text detection that addresses limitations of existing datasets by providing character-level annotations for precise localization of AI-generated segments in mixed human-AI authorship scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI text detection datasets are limited by being outdated, predominantly English-only, and lacking character-level annotations needed for precise localization of AI-generated content in mixed authorship texts.

Method: Constructed a large-scale bilingual (English and Russian) corpus using diverse modern proprietary and open-source LLMs, designed to support both traditional binary classification and novel AI-generated interval detection with character-level annotations.

Result: LLMTrace provides a comprehensive dataset that enables training and evaluation of more nuanced AI detection models capable of handling mixed authorship scenarios and precise localization of AI-generated content.

Conclusion: LLMTrace serves as a vital resource for developing next-generation AI detection models that can address practical challenges like mixed human-AI authorship and provide fine-grained detection capabilities.

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

### [61] [Bounds of Chain-of-Thought Robustness: Reasoning Steps, Embed Norms, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21284)
*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis showing that input perturbations in Chain-of-Thought reasoning have an upper bound that increases with reasoning steps but can never be eliminated, even with infinite steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research shows CoT outputs are sensitive to input perturbations, but lacks theoretical understanding of how perturbations propagate during reasoning, limiting prompt optimization improvements.

Method: Theoretical derivation of perturbation upper bounds for CoT outputs, applying analysis to Linear Self-Attention models as simplified Transformers, and experimental validation on three datasets with four models.

Result: Established that perturbation upper bound increases with reasoning steps but cannot be eliminated; for LSA models, bound is negatively correlated with input embedding and hidden state vector norms.

Conclusion: Theoretical framework explains perturbation propagation in CoT reasoning, providing insights for developing more robust prompt optimization methods through understanding perturbation dynamics.

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

*Kin Ian Lo,Hala Hawashin,Mina Abbaszadeh,Tilen Limback-Stokin,Hadi Wazni,Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP improves vision-language models by explicitly encoding syntactic structure using tensor networks, achieving better compositional reasoning with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often fail on tasks requiring understanding of word order and predicate-argument structure due to neglecting compositional language structure.

Method: Combines frozen CLIP vision transformer with novel tensor network text encoder that parses sentences using Combinatory Categorial Grammar, factorizes high-order tensors for efficiency, and trains with self-supervised contrastive loss.

Result: Improves CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on SVO-Swap benchmark.

Conclusion: Explicit linguistic structure embedding via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Updesh is a high-quality synthetic instruction-following dataset for 13 Indian languages, created by grounding data generation in language-specific Wikipedia content, which significantly improves multilingual AI performance especially for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing effective multilingual AI systems that are culturally grounded, particularly in low-resource settings, by exploring synthetic data generation methods beyond the dominant translation-based approach.

Method: Used a bottom-up generation strategy prompting large open-source LLMs (>=235B parameters) to create culturally contextualized datasets grounded in language-specific Wikipedia content, producing 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages.

Result: Models trained on Updesh achieved significant gains on generative tasks and remained competitive on multiple-choice NLU tasks, with most pronounced improvements in low and medium-resource languages, narrowing the gap with high-resource languages.

Conclusion: Effective multilingual AI requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies, as demonstrated by the success of the bottom-up synthetic data generation approach.

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

*Daniel Vennemeyer,Phan Anh Duong,Tiffany Zhan,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper decomposes LLM sycophancy into distinct behaviors (agreement and praise) and shows they are encoded along separate linear directions in latent space, can be independently controlled, and maintain consistent structure across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether sycophantic behaviors in LLMs arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes, and to decompose sycophancy into its constituent components.

Method: Used difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry analysis across multiple models and datasets to examine sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement.

Result: Found that the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions, can be independently amplified/suppressed without affecting others, and their representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.

Conclusion: Sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations rather than a single unified mechanism.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

*Zhilin Wang,Jiaqi Zeng,Olivier Delalleau,Ellie Evans,Daniel Egert,Hoo-Chang Shin,Felipe Soares,Yi Dong,Oleksii Kuchaiev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLBFF combines human preferences with rule-based verification to create more interpretable and versatile reward models for LLM alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing RL paradigms: RLHF lacks interpretability and suffers from reward hacking due to subjective human judgments, while RLVR is too narrow by focusing only on correctness. Need for a method that captures nuanced response quality beyond mere correctness.

Method: Extracts binary principles from natural language feedback (e.g., accuracy: yes/no, readability: yes/no) and trains reward models as entailment tasks where responses satisfy or don't satisfy arbitrary principles. Uses fully open-source recipe to align models like Qwen3-32B.

Result: Achieves top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 leaderboard). Matches/exceeds performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 at <5% inference cost.

Conclusion: RLBFF successfully bridges human-driven preferences with rule-based precision, enabling customizable reward models that capture nuanced quality aspects while maintaining interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using next-token probabilities (NTPs) from VLMs as lightweight features for detecting hallucinations, achieving comparable performance to full VLM-based detection methods with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods using VLMs are computationally intensive and increase latency. There's a need for efficient on-the-fly detection to enhance VLM reliability.

Method: Train traditional ML models using NTP-based features from VLMs, which quantify model uncertainty. Also explore augmenting with linguistic NTPs and integrating VLM prediction scores.

Result: NTP-based features are effective predictors of hallucinations, enabling simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to strong VLMs. Augmentation with linguistic NTPs and VLM scores further improves detection.

Conclusion: NTP-based lightweight methods provide efficient hallucination detection, paving the way for simple solutions to enhance VLM reliability without heavy computational overhead.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A quasi-synthetic data generation framework using Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices for writer-independent offline signature verification, achieving low error rates without real-world training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline signature verification is challenging in writer-independent settings, and existing methods depend on real-world datasets. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces.

Method: Uses Riemannian Gaussian Mixture on SPD matrices to generate synthetic writers from a small set of genuine samples. Riemannian Gaussian sampling creates positive and negative synthetic populations, followed by metric learning with similar/dissimilar SPD pairs.

Result: Experiments on Western and Asian signature datasets show low error rates under intra- and cross-dataset evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces for effective writer-independent signature verification systems.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0 is an efficient multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition in a single framework using a diffusion transformer with optimized VAE and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified system that extends traditional text-to-image generation into a more interactive and multidimensional creative tool for both creativity and professional applications, addressing the need for efficient high-resolution image generation with multimodal capabilities.

Method: Developed a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE that reduces image tokens, pretrained on billions of text-image pairs with comprehensive data collection across vertical scenarios. Used multi-modal post-training with fine-tuned VLM model for joint T2I and image editing training, and integrated inference acceleration techniques including adversarial distillation, distribution matching, quantization, and speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing, with inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating 2K images. Demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks including precise image editing, in-context reasoning, multi-image reference, and multiple output image generation.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 successfully extends traditional T2I systems into an interactive multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundaries of generative AI for both creative and professional applications while maintaining high efficiency and performance.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and

### [70] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using ResNet-50 achieves 96.7% accuracy in breast cancer detection on benchmark datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data through similarity-based training on unlabeled mammograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a major global health concern where early detection is crucial. Deep learning methods show promise but struggle with accuracy due to limited labeled datasets. This paper aims to overcome this limitation using contrastive learning that works effectively with smaller labeled datasets.

Method: The study introduces a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using ResNet-50. It trains on large amounts of unlabeled mammogram data using similarity index, applies various augmentations and transformations to improve performance, and fine-tunes on a small labeled dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieves 96.7% accuracy in breast cancer detection on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The contrastive learning framework effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in medical imaging, demonstrating superior performance in breast cancer detection and offering a promising solution for early diagnosis.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (FMs) show promise for automated quality inspection but fail on real-world industrial data despite performing well on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage FMs' zero-shot generalization capabilities for automated quality inspection in manufacturing, replacing tedious labeling tasks with simple text prompts and enabling model reuse across products.

Method: Testing multiple recent Foundation Models on both custom real-world industrial image data and public image datasets to evaluate their performance in zero-shot settings.

Result: All tested FMs failed on real-world industrial data while performing well on public benchmark datasets, revealing a significant performance gap.

Conclusion: Current Foundation Models are not yet suitable for real-world industrial quality inspection applications despite their strong performance on public benchmarks, highlighting the need for domain-specific adaptations.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A universal Neural Space (NS) framework using encoder-decoder architecture to create shared feature representations for multiple vision tasks, reducing redundancy and improving generalization with a lightweight CNN backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are inefficient for applications requiring multiple modular tasks, as each task requires mapping to different latent domains, leading to redundancy and poor generalization across domain shifts.

Method: Proposed encoder-decoder framework that pre-computes transformation-aware, generalizable features across vision tasks. Uses lightweight CNN-based backbone to enable multiple downstream AI modules to share the same feature space.

Result: Demonstrated that various imaging and vision modules including demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation can be performed efficiently in the Neural Space.

Conclusion: The Neural Space architecture reduces redundancy, improves generalization across domain shifts, and establishes an efficient foundation for multi-task vision pipelines while being hardware-friendly due to its lightweight CNN backbone.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

*Dani Manjah,Tim Bary,Benoît Gérin,Benoît Macq,Christophe de Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a strategy for selecting the most useful images for training edge models by combining high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity-based approaches to maximize model quality while minimizing transmission costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge camera systems need regular model updates but face computational constraints. Current practice uses complex teacher models on central servers to annotate data for training smaller edge models, but this requires efficient image selection to balance model quality and transmission costs.

Method: The authors explore image selection strategies that combine high-confidence stream-based approaches with diversity-based methods to identify the most valuable training samples while keeping dataset queries minimal.

Result: The proposed approach shows that for similar training iterations, the combined high-confidence and diversity-based strategy produces high-quality models with significantly reduced dataset queries compared to other methods.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach that leverages both confidence-based streaming and diversity considerations is effective for optimizing edge model training by selecting the most informative images while minimizing transmission overhead.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [74] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON is an instruction-following virtual try-on system that uses natural language instructions for fine-grained styling control, eliminating the need for manual mask generation by leveraging Vision Language Models and image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on models rely on binary masks that are difficult to create, require background knowledge, and cannot handle complex styling instructions like 'sleeves rolled up'. The masking-based approach has limitations in achieving desirable results and handling certain styling scenarios.

Method: InstructVTON uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models to automatically generate binary masks based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. It formulates virtual try-on as an image-guided inpainting task and is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art results with styling control, simplifies the user experience by removing the need for precise mask drawing, and automates multiple rounds of image generation for complex try-on scenarios that traditional masking-based models cannot handle.

Conclusion: InstructVTON provides a more accessible and powerful virtual try-on solution by leveraging natural language instructions and automated mask generation, enabling fine-grained styling control that was previously impossible with traditional masking-based approaches.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

*Dana A Abdullah,Dana Rasul Hamad,Bishar Rasheed Ibrahim,Sirwan Abdulwahid Aula,Aso Khaleel Ameen,Sabat Salih Hamadamin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet is a deep learning model for recognizing altered fingerprints using VGG16 backbone and cosine similarity, achieving high accuracy (96.7-99.54%) on real altered fingerprint datasets with strict thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Altered fingerprint recognition is crucial for security applications like border control and forensics, as adversaries can modify ridge patterns to evade detection systems.

Method: Uses VGG16 backbone for feature extraction and cosine similarity for comparing embeddings, evaluated on SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Result: Achieves 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% accuracy for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels respectively with strict thresholds. Threshold sensitivity study shows accuracy drops sharply (to 7.86-29.51%) when threshold is relaxed from 0.92 to 0.72.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior synthetic alteration studies, demonstrates readiness for real-world deployment where both security and recognition resilience are critical, and highlights the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: To enhance bimanual robotic manipulation by incorporating semantic cues from pre-trained vision transformers into voxel-based representations.

Method: Extract attention maps from DINOv2 ViT model as pixel-level saliency scores, lift them into 3D voxel grid, and integrate into behavior cloning policy.

Result: 8.2% absolute improvement and 21.9% relative gain across all tasks in RLBench bimanual benchmark when integrated with state-of-the-art voxel-based policy.

Conclusion: Attention-guided featurization from pre-trained vision transformers significantly enhances performance in bimanual robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative benchmark analysis of 36 real-time object detectors (YOLO v8-v12 and RT-DETR v1-v2) for blueberry detection, evaluated on a new dataset of 661 images with 85,879 labeled instances, including semi-supervised learning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blueberry detection in natural environments is challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur. Deep learning detectors need large-scale datasets and optimal accuracy/speed/memory trade-offs for practical deployment.

Method: Evaluated 36 model variants on a curated dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labeled blueberries. Applied Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning on 1,035 unlabeled images to enhance performance.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved 93.3% mAP@50, RT-DETRv2-X achieved 93.6% mAP@50. SSL fine-tuning improved accuracy up to 94.8% mAP@50 with RT-DETR-v2-X. Mid-sized models offered best accuracy-speed balance.

Conclusion: RT-DETR-v2-X achieved the highest accuracy after SSL fine-tuning. Semi-supervised learning shows promise but needs more research for cross-domain data. Dataset and software made publicly available.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight ROI augmentation strategy for mammography classification that probabilistically replaces full images with random ROI crops during training, showing modest performance improvements on the Mini-DDSM dataset without increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening with mammography is crucial for early detection, but deep learning models are limited by low-resolution datasets and small sample sizes. The paper aims to improve mammogram interpretation through simple data-centric approaches.

Method: Introduces ROI augmentation where full mammogram images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops from a precomputed bounding-box bank during training. Uses patient-level cross-validation and evaluates ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and efficiency metrics.

Result: ROI augmentation (best parameters: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains on Mini-DDSM, with performance varying across folds. PR-AUC remains flat to slightly lower. The method maintains unchanged inference-time costs.

Conclusion: Simple ROI augmentation strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications, demonstrating the value of data-centric approaches.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using mirror reflections as auxiliary views for single-image 3D reconstruction by treating reflections as virtual cameras and exploiting geometric symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mirror reflections provide stereo information within a single capture, enabling multi-view stereo from a single image without complex setups.

Method: Design transformation to construct physically valid virtual cameras from reflections, use symmetric-aware loss for pose refinement, and extend to dynamic scenes with per-frame geometry recovery.

Result: Enables generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction compatible with feed-forward models, validated on synthetic dataset and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Mirror reflections can effectively serve as auxiliary views for single-image 3D reconstruction, simplifying imaging process while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack is a street-level, language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels and uses interpretable attributes to assess building occupancy after disasters, achieving high precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building-level occupancy assessment after disasters is crucial for triage and resource allocation, but current methods like overhead imagery miss important facade details while street-view imagery is sparse and difficult to align with parcels.

Method: FacadeTrack uses panoramic video linked to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and extracts interpretable attributes (entry blockage, temporary coverings, debris) to drive two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design separating perception from conservative reasoning.

Result: The two-stage approach achieved precision of 0.927, recall of 0.781, and F-1 score of 0.848 across post-Hurricane Helene surveys, outperforming the one-stage baseline (precision 0.943, recall 0.728, F-1 0.822).

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments with intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics that reveal error sources, enabling targeted quality control for integration into emergency management workflows.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use semantic representations to complement visual features when recognizing social interactions from moving shapes. Semantic models, particularly verb-based embeddings from descriptions, best explain human similarity judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what semantic representations humans employ alongside visual features when perceiving social interactions from simple animations of moving shapes.

Method: Study 1: Direct labeling of animations by human participants. Study 2: Measuring representational geometry of 27 social interactions through similarity judgments, comparing visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings from descriptions.

Result: Human responses were distributed in Study 1. In Study 2, semantic models provided complementary information to visual features, with verb-based embeddings from descriptions accounting for human similarity judgments the best.

Conclusion: Social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract representations.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

TL;DR: EGS is a novel cross-view geo-localization framework that uses E(2)-Steerable CNN and graph-based global-local consistency to improve robustness against viewpoint variations and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL methods struggle with severe appearance variations from different UAV orientations/fields of view and lack reliable global-local correspondences, limiting cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes EGS framework with E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for rotation/viewpoint-invariant features and graph structure with virtual super-node to aggregate global semantics and enforce global-local consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks show EGS achieves substantial performance gains and new state-of-the-art results in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: EGS effectively addresses CVGL challenges by combining steerable feature extraction with graph-based global-local consistency, demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

### [83] [DENet: Dual-Path Edge Network with Global-Local Attention for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20701)
*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection that decouples edge enhancement and semantic modeling to address the conflict between capturing spatial details and extracting semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets lack distinctive features and blend into noisy backgrounds, creating challenges for deep models that need to balance high-resolution spatial details for small targets with robust semantic context for larger targets.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Path Edge Network with: 1) Bidirectional Interaction Module using Local and Global Self-Attention for multi-scale feature dependencies, and 2) Multi-Edge Refiner using cascaded Taylor finite difference operators with attention-driven gating for precise edge localization.

Result: The method provides precise infrared small target detection and localization by effectively combining structural semantics and edge refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a promising solution that addresses feature misalignment and suboptimal performance in infrared small target detection through complementary processing paths for edge enhancement and semantic modeling.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge

*Ruixu Zhang,Yuran Wang,Xinyi Hu,Chaoyu Mai,Wenxuan Liu,Danni Xu,Xian Zhong,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces group intention forecasting (GIF) as a novel task to predict when collective intentions emerge from individual actions, presents the SHOT dataset for basketball scenarios, and proposes the GIFT framework for modeling group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intention recognition focuses on individual intentions but overlooks the complexities of collective intentions in group settings where shared goals emerge through multiple individuals' actions and interactions.

Method: The authors propose SHOT (a large-scale basketball video dataset with multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention annotations) and GIFT (a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence).

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the gap in collective intention recognition by introducing the GIF task, providing a comprehensive dataset, and developing an effective forecasting framework that can be applied to real-world group scenarios.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neptune-X is a data-centric generative-selection framework that addresses maritime object detection challenges by generating diverse synthetic data with a multi-modality-conditioned generative model and selecting task-relevant samples through active sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces challenges due to scarce annotated data and poor generalization across various maritime attributes, particularly underperforming in underrepresented scenarios like open-sea environments.

Method: Proposes Neptune-X framework with two components: X-to-Maritime generative model using Bidirectional Object-Water Attention for realistic scene synthesis, and Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for dynamic sample selection based on task relevance.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach sets new benchmarks in maritime scene synthesis and significantly improves detection accuracy, especially in challenging and underrepresented settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data scarcity and generalization issues in maritime object detection through synthetic data generation and intelligent sample selection.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

*Sofia McLeod,Chee-Kheng Chng,Matthew Rodda,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STELLA is the first end-to-end Crater-Based Navigation pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions, achieving metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracy across varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Crater-Based Navigation methods were designed for short-duration landing missions with nadir imagery, but lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery under varying illumination over year-long campaigns, requiring a more robust solution.

Method: STELLA combines Mask R-CNN-based crater detection, descriptor-less crater identification, robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination back-end. Tested on CRESENT-365 dataset simulating year-long missions.

Result: STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes.

Conclusion: This represents the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in true lunar mapping settings, providing operational guidelines for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

### [87] [Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751)
*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unimodal vision and language models develop partially aligned semantic representations in mid-to-late layers, reflecting human preferences and strengthening with exemplar aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where alignment emerges in unimodal networks, what cues support it, whether it captures human preferences, and how exemplar aggregation affects alignment.

Method: Systematic investigation of alignment patterns across model layers, testing robustness to semantic vs. appearance changes, forced-choice 'Pick-a-Pic' task for human preference comparison, and examining exemplar aggregation effects.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers, is robust to appearance changes but sensitive to semantic alterations, mirrors human preferences in many-to-many scenarios, and strengthens with embedding averaging.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and is enhanced by exemplar aggregation.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

### [88] [FreeInsert: Personalized Object Insertion with Geometric and Style Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20756)
*Yuhong Zhang,Han Wang,Yiwen Wang,Rong Xie,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInsert is a training-free framework that enables geometrically controlled object insertion into images using 3D information, addressing limitations in existing 2D editing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods lack geometric control over inserted objects (confined to 2D space), struggle with style consistency between objects and backgrounds, and require extensive training for object insertion tasks.

Method: The framework converts 2D objects into 3D using existing 3D generation models, performs interactive editing at the 3D level, then re-renders to 2D from specified views. It combines geometric control from 3D rendering with style and content control through diffusion adapters.

Result: The method produces geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images without requiring training, enabling precise object insertion with realistic style matching.

Conclusion: FreeInsert provides an effective training-free solution for personalized image composition with geometric control and style consistency, overcoming limitations of current 2D editing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

TL;DR: CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement framework that improves existing identity customization models by combining face swapping techniques with diffusion models through a triple-flow fusion approach, while introducing ResInversion for faster inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis face issues with degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity.

Method: Uses face swapping techniques and pretrained diffusion models to obtain additional representations. Proposes triple-flow fused PerGeneration that combines counter-directional latent spaces, and ResInversion method for noise rectification via pre-diffusion mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls. ResInversion reduces inversion time by 129 times compared to null-text inversion.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer provides a comprehensive training-free control solution for personalized models with improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

### [91] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework for cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, addressing domain shifts between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain, but in practice, domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data, leading to inaccurate pseudolabels and sub-optimal performance.

Method: The DAC framework builds on co-training with two sub-models providing cross pseudo supervision, integrating feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks to address inaccurate pseudo supervision and enhance domain-invariant feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM medical image datasets demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Conclusion: The proposed DAC framework effectively addresses the challenging CD-SSDG scenario where domain shifts occur between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2 extends the DEIM framework with DINOv3 features, creating a family of object detection models from X to Atto sizes that achieve superior performance-cost trade-offs across different deployment scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build upon the success of DEIM's Dense O2O and MAL framework for real-time DETRs, extending it with DINOv3 features to create more efficient and scalable object detection models for various deployment environments.

Method: For larger models (X, L, M, S): use DINOv3-pretrained backbones with Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) to convert single-scale to multi-scale features. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, Atto): employ HGNetv2 with depth/width pruning, simplified decoder, and upgraded Dense O2O.

Result: DEIMv2-X achieves 57.8 AP with 50.3M parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models. DEIMv2-S is first sub-10M model (9.71M) to exceed 50 AP (50.9 AP). DEIMv2-Pico (1.5M parameters) delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano with 50% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes new state-of-the-art results with superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, significantly outperforming YOLO series and prior models in efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are crucial for safety-critical applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. CLIP, as a backbone for many VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem, necessitating robust defense methods.

Method: Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum (DAC-LoRA) uses an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attacks guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss. It integrates adversarial training into standard PEFT pipelines.

Result: DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. The framework is lightweight, effective, and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: The DAC-LoRA framework provides an effective and easily integrable method to enhance the robustness of VLMs against adversarial attacks within standard PEFT pipelines, addressing critical security concerns in safety-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.

TL;DR: FedDSPG is a federated domain generalization method that generates domain-specific soft prompts from a generative perspective to handle domain shifts in unseen target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods based on prompt learning have limited diversity and ignore information from unknown domains, posing challenges for downstream-task adaptation in federated learning settings.

Method: Introduces domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain, integrates content and domain knowledge into a generative model among clients, and uses the generator to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains during inference.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that FedDSPG outperforms existing strong baselines in federated domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed generative approach for domain-specific soft prompt generation effectively handles federated domain generalization tasks and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated

LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin

These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class

yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vulnerabilities exist in earlier video frame sampling strategies, the safety of the latest prompt-guided sampling approaches remains unexplored, creating a critical research gap.

Method: Uses a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes universal perturbations to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions using GPT-4o-mini and a shadow VideoLLM.

Result: Achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate across three prompt-guided sampling strategies and three advanced VideoLLMs.

Conclusion: Highlights the urgent need to develop more secure sampling strategies for VideoLLMs, as current prompt-guided approaches are vulnerable to sophisticated poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Game of Regularizer (GoR) uses only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting to reduce conflict between supervision signals and improve convergence. Also introduces QAT-EKD-GoR ensemble distillation framework using multiple heterogeneous teacher models.

Result: GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods on image classification, object detection, and LLM compression. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. EKD-GoR can even outperform full-precision models under optimal conditions.

Conclusion: GoR provides a robust solution for real-world deployment of compressed AI models, effectively balancing quantization and distillation objectives to achieve superior performance on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge compared web-collected noisy training data vs. expert-curated clean data for automated plant identification across 10,000 species using 1.1M images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large-scale web-collected datasets with labeling errors can compete with smaller expert-verified datasets for automated plant identification systems.

Method: Used two training strategies: web-collected noisy data vs. expert-checked clean data, tested on a third independent dataset from Pl@ntNet mobile app queries.

Result: The challenge assessed performance of both approaches on continental-scale plant identification across 10,000 species.

Conclusion: The study provides analysis of whether web-scale noisy data can be viable alternative to expert-curated datasets for large-scale plant identification systems.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [99] [TasselNetV4: A vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20857)
*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TasselNetV4 is a vision foundation model for cross-species plant counting that combines local counting with extract-and-match paradigm, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant counting models are species-specific, but plant biodiversity and new cultivars make it impossible to build all species-dependent models. Plants are dynamic and non-rigid, making current class-agnostic counting models suboptimal for plant counting.

Method: TasselNetV4 extends TasselNet by marrying local counting with extract-and-match paradigm from class-agnostic counting. It uses a plain vision transformer with novel multi-branch box-aware local counters to enhance cross-scale robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia datasets show TasselNetV4 achieves superior counting performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art CAC models.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 emerges as a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting, shifting from species-specific to cross-species counting paradigm.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised model for retinal OCT segmentation that introduces a differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of layers and lesions, improving performance while ensuring topological correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods for retinal OCT segmentation often produce anatomically implausible results, fail to model layer-lesion interactions effectively, and lack guarantees on topological correctness, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised model with a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine that enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions. The model learns disentangled representations separating spatial and style factors, leveraging unlabeled and partially labeled datasets while enforcing anatomical constraints.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public and internal OCT datasets for both lesion and layer segmentation, demonstrating improved generalization to pathological cases using partially annotated training data.

Conclusion: Anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning enable accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation, showing potential for clinical applications in retinal disease diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2016 plant identification challenge evaluated large-scale plant recognition systems on 110K+ images of 1000 species, focusing on open-set recognition where systems must handle unknown categories not seen during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic biodiversity monitoring scenarios by testing plant identification methods at very large scale, moving beyond traditional classification to address the practical challenge of rejecting false positives from unknown plant species.

Method: Used a dataset of over 110,000 images covering 1000 West European plant species collected through participatory sensing. Evaluated systems on open-set recognition, requiring them to classify known species while automatically rejecting images from unknown categories.

Result: The challenge provided a large-scale benchmark for plant identification systems, testing their robustness to unknown species in real-world biodiversity monitoring conditions.

Conclusion: LifeCLEF 2016 successfully advanced plant identification research by introducing open-set recognition as a key evaluation criterion, better reflecting the challenges of real-world biodiversity monitoring where systems encounter previously unseen species.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

*Yan Zhang,Jiaqing Lin,Miao Zhang,Kui Xiao,Xiaoju Hou,Yue Zhao,Zhifei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA is a novel method that improves KB-VQA by using summarized and reranked captions to enhance LLM reasoning without expensive training, achieving state-of-the-art results on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KB-VQA methods using LLMs with image captions suffer from excessive noise in captions and LLMs' limited understanding of VQA tasks, which restricts their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes SCRA-VQA which converts images to captions using pre-trained visual language models, then summarizes and reorders captions to exclude unrelated information while generating contextual examples to improve LLM understanding.

Result: Achieves 38.8% accuracy on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA using a 6.7B parameter LLM, demonstrating excellent performance without expensive end-to-end training.

Conclusion: The caption-rerank process effectively enhances LLMs' ability to understand image information and questions, improving reasoning capability and task adaptability in knowledge-based VQA.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

### [103] [The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20878)
*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals an asymmetry between perceptual optimization and image quality assessment (IQA) - fidelity metrics that work well for IQA are not necessarily effective for optimization, especially under adversarial training. Discriminator design significantly impacts optimization quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the correlation between optimization objectives and IQA metrics, which remains underexplored despite their central role in perceptual optimization.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis of fidelity and adversarial objectives, examining their effectiveness as optimization objectives versus IQA metrics. Tested different discriminator architectures including patch-level, convolutional, vanilla, and Transformer-based alternatives.

Result: Found unanticipated asymmetry between optimization and assessment. Discriminator design plays decisive role - patch-level and convolutional architectures provide better detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives. Discriminators suppress artifacts during optimization but offer limited benefits when reused for IQA.

Conclusion: The insights advance understanding of loss function design and IQA transferability, paving way for more principled approaches to perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models struggle with biases from training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and poor generalization to diverse questions and images.

Method: The model combines Object Interaction Self-Attention to capture complex object interactions within images and a GAN-Based Debiasing framework to generate unbiased data distributions for learning robust features.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets show excellent performance, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases for advancing VQA tasks, demonstrating that IOG-VQA effectively combines visual and textual information to overcome inherent biases.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nuclear Diffusion combines low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling for video dehazing, outperforming traditional RPCA methods on cardiac ultrasound data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods fail to capture the rich variability in real video data due to their sparsity assumption, particularly in removing structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content.

Method: A hybrid framework integrating low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling, called Nuclear Diffusion, which combines model-based temporal models with deep generative priors.

Result: The method demonstrates improved dehazing performance on cardiac ultrasound data, with better contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic) compared to traditional RPCA.

Conclusion: Combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors shows strong potential for high-fidelity video restoration applications.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of synthetic images from advanced models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs creates challenges for detection, requiring methods to identify subtle generation artifacts.

Method: Leverages local pixel dependencies based on Markov Random Fields to reconstruct images and expose texture/edge inconsistencies. Proposes FerretNet, a 1.1M parameter network trained on ProGAN dataset.

Result: Achieves 97.1% average accuracy on open-world benchmark with 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Conclusion: FerretNet provides efficient and robust synthetic image detection by focusing on generation artifacts, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse generative models.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF extends Concept Bottleneck Models to video classification by handling temporal dependencies and providing interpretable concept-based explanations across global, local, and temporal perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending interpretable concept-based models from static images to video data is challenging due to temporal dependencies essential for capturing actions and events in videos.

Method: MoTIF is a transformer-inspired architecture that adapts concept bottleneck framework for video classification, handling sequences of arbitrary length and capturing temporal concept motifs.

Result: The framework effectively transfers concept-based modeling to video data, maintaining competitive performance while enabling better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts.

Conclusion: Concept-based modeling can be successfully applied to video classification, providing interpretable insights through global concept importance, local relevance, and temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

TL;DR: Particle filters enable 3D object localization using camera sequences for distant objects where traditional depth estimation fails, validated through drone-based wildfire monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D localization methods (dense depth estimation, 3D reconstruction) are infeasible for distant objects or computationally constrained tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Method: Proposes particle filters for single and multiple target localization using camera poses and image segments, tested in 3D simulation and drone-based sequences with GNSS camera pose estimates.

Result: Particle filters successfully solve practical localization tasks where other methods fail, demonstrating effectiveness for drone-based wildfire monitoring with existing segmentation models.

Conclusion: Particle filters provide a flexible, detection-method-independent solution for 3D object localization in resource-constrained scenarios, enabling practical applications like wildfire monitoring.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba is a novel framework that combines local Mamba-style scanning with global receptive fields for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery, addressing Vision Mamba's limitation of overlooking local features while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba has global receptive field and low computational complexity but tends to overlook critical local features like textures and edges, which are essential for accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts with complex scene structures and diverse object scales.

Method: SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with global receptive field. The first two stages perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details, while subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader contextual information. Overlapping shifted windows enhance inter-region information exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SwinMamba shows effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery by enhancing both local and global feature perception.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Motivation: Whole slide images in computational pathology have extremely long and variable sequence lengths (200-200K), leading to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods struggle with training efficiency and optimization under limited supervision.

Method: Proposes a pack-based MIL framework that packs multiple variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for batched training. Introduces a residual branch that composes discarded features into a hyperslide with tailored labels, and an attention-driven downsampler to compress features and reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves up to 8% accuracy improvement while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI) benchmark. Extensive experiments show significant potential for addressing data challenges in computational pathology.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in computational pathology by enabling efficient training while preserving data heterogeneity, demonstrating that focusing on data challenges holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

### [112] [SimDiff: Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model for Physically Plausible Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20927)
*Akihisa Watanabe,Jiawei Ren,Li Siyao,Yichen Peng,Erwin Wu,Edgar Simo-Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff is a Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that generates physically plausible human motion by integrating environment parameters directly into the denoising process, eliminating the need for computationally expensive simulator calls during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating physically plausible human motion rely on simulator-based motion projection layers, which are computationally expensive due to their sequential nature and prevent parallelization.

Method: The authors reinterpret simulator-based motion projection as a form of guidance in diffusion processes and propose SimDiff, which conditions the denoising process on environment parameters (e.g., gravity, wind) to generate physically plausible motions without repeated simulator calls.

Result: SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently, provides fine-grained control over physical coefficients, and demonstrates compositional generalization by successfully handling unseen combinations of environmental parameters.

Conclusion: SimDiff offers an efficient alternative to simulator-based approaches for physically plausible motion generation, enabling parallelization and fine-grained control while maintaining physical plausibility through direct parameter conditioning in the diffusion process.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

*Bum Jun Kim,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates architectural design choices that make vision models more robust to Gaussian noise, identifying four key patterns and providing theoretical explanations for why they work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert empirical insights into actionable design rules for building more robust vision models.

Method: Extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirical identification of design patterns, followed by theoretical analysis including proofs about low-pass stem kernels, downsampling effects, pooling mechanisms, and Lipschitz bounds for CLIP ViTs.

Result: Identified four consistent design patterns: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs over CLIP ViTs, yielding up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6% accuracy gains. Theoretical analysis explains these findings through noise attenuation mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, provides a theory explaining observed trends, and offers practical plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Method: PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review that systematically analyzes the evolving landscape of scene graph research in surgery, examining applications, methodological progress, and identifying research gaps.

Result: The review reveals rapid growth in surgical SG research but uncovers a critical 'data divide' where internal-view research uses real-world 2D video while external-view 4D modeling relies on simulated data. Methodologically, the field has advanced to specialized foundation models that significantly outperform generalist models in surgical contexts.

Conclusion: Surgical scene graphs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge that enables intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training, despite ongoing challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation that are being actively addressed.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection

defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

Motivation: The dynamic propagation of social media has increased the reach of financial advisory content via podcast videos, but extracting insights from lengthy (30-40 minute) multimodal segments remains challenging.

Method: FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with speaker diarization. It uses a modified DPO-based loss function with fact-checking and a ranker-based retrieval mechanism to align keyframes with summarized content.

Result: Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability compared to LLMs and VLMs. The framework establishes a new standard for multimodal summarization.

Conclusion: FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, opening new research avenues. The Fin-APT dataset (470 videos) and code are publicly available.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for

*Yue Duan,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASD is an adaptor that enables cold-start SSL learners for deep image clustering without prerequisites like pretraining or clustering models, achieving near-ground-truth performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL-integrated deep clustering methods require prerequisites like pretraining or trained models, limiting flexible out-of-box application of SSL learners for image clustering.

Method: Randomly sample pseudo-labeled data, use instance-level classifier to learn them, track class transitions to extract similarities, assign cluster-level labels, and use pseudo-labeled data to trigger SSL learner.

Result: Superior performance across benchmarks against latest deep image clustering approaches, with only 1.33% accuracy gap on CIFAR-10 compared to SSL methods using ground-truth.

Conclusion: ASD enables effective cold-start SSL for image clustering without prerequisites and can further boost existing SSL-embedded deep clustering methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

*Geunhyeok Yu,Sunjae Jeong,Yoonyoung Choi,Jaeseung Kim,Hyoseok Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiNGER is a novel distillation framework that suppresses high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformer features while preserving informative signals, improving student model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When used in knowledge distillation, these artifacts dominate the objective, causing students to overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the benefits of larger teacher models.

Method: Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) uses principled teacher feature refinement with nullspace-guided perturbation to suppress artifacts while preserving information. This is implemented efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter requiring minimal structural modification.

Result: Extensive experiments show SiNGER consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer, more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively addresses the artifact suppression vs. signal preservation trade-off in knowledge distillation, enabling better transfer of knowledge from Vision Transformer teachers to student models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying

improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,

efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for

TL;DR: SNCE is a novel concept erasure method that precisely removes harmful content from text-to-image models by manipulating only a single neuron, achieving surgical precision while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models pose safety risks by generating harmful content, and existing concept erasure methods struggle with precise removal while maintaining image quality.

Method: Train a Sparse Autoencoder to map text embeddings into a sparse latent space, identify harmful concept-specific neurons using modulated frequency scoring, and suppress activations of those neurons.

Result: SNCE achieves state-of-the-art concept erasure results, preserves generation capabilities for non-target concepts, and exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SNCE method enables precise and safe concept erasure in text-to-image models with minimal impact on overall image quality and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: KDSS is a lightweight sub-sampling algorithm for biological point clouds that enables full-resolution segmentation without down-sampling, working across different plant species and sensor modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant organ segmentation solutions are problem-specific, require extensive pre-processing, and force down-sampling to meet hardware/network constraints, limiting their applicability across different species and sensors.

Method: Proposed KDSS algorithm for sub-sampling biological point clouds that is sensor-agnostic and species-agnostic, allowing segmentation of full-resolution point clouds without down-sampling.

Result: KDSS combined with state-of-the-art segmentation models achieves satisfying results across different modalities including photogrammetry, laser triangulation, and LiDAR for various plant species.

Conclusion: KDSS serves as a lightweight, resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation, applicable regardless of species and sensor modality.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mambo is a new FG-BG decomposition framework for few-shot out-of-distribution detection that addresses limitations of previous methods by learning background prompts and using patch self-calibrated tuning for flexible background patch selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods suffer from low robustness due to over-reliance on local class similarity and fixed background patch extraction strategies, leading to poor FS-OOD detection performance.

Method: Proposes learning background prompts to obtain local background similarity containing both background and image semantic information, then refining it with local class similarity. Uses patch self-calibrated tuning to flexibly select background patches based on sample diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Mambo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both OOD detection and near OOD detection settings.

Conclusion: Mambo effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by reducing dependence on local class similarity and introducing flexible background extraction, demonstrating superior performance in FS-OOD detection tasks.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel stratification methods (IPS and WDES) for creating representative test sets in image segmentation tasks, addressing the limitations of random splitting that leads to biased evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random dataset splitting in image segmentation often produces unrepresentative test sets due to multi-label structure and class imbalance, resulting in biased model evaluations and poor generalization.

Method: Proposes Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) - a label-aware sampling method, and Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES) - a genetic algorithm that minimizes Wasserstein distance to optimize label distribution similarity across dataset splits.

Result: WDES consistently produces more representative splits than random sampling, leading to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation across diverse segmentation tasks (street scenes, medical imaging, satellite imagery), especially effective for small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets.

Conclusion: WDES is particularly valuable for handling challenging segmentation datasets where conventional splitting strategies are most prone to bias, and the method is proven to be globally optimal given sufficient generations.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net uses semantic hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals in an end-to-end deep neural network for fine-grained classification, achieving competitive performance without requiring part annotations or cropping techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-grained classification models rely on part annotations or automatic cropping methods, which suffer from incomplete representation of local features. Humans recognize objects through semantic associations, so leveraging hierarchical taxonomy can improve classification.

Method: Proposes EnGraf-Net, an end-to-end deep neural network that incorporates semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals, eliminating the need for manual part annotations or cropping techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets show EnGraf-Net achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches without requiring cropping or manual annotations.

Conclusion: Semantic hierarchy can effectively serve as supervised signals for fine-grained classification, providing a robust alternative to part-based approaches while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual

### [125] [Vision Transformers: the threat of realistic adversarial patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21084)
*Kasper Cools,Clara Maathuis,Alexander M. van Oers,Claudia S. Hübner,Nikos Deligiannis,Marijke Vandewal,Geert De Cubber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks despite their robustness advantages over CNNs, with attack success rates varying significantly (40.04%-99.97%) across different ViT models, confirming cross-architectural transferability of adversarial techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security vulnerabilities of Vision Transformers (ViTs) against evasion attacks, particularly adversarial patches, and examine the transferability of attack techniques from CNNs to ViTs given ViTs' increasing adoption and perceived robustness.

Method: Used Creases Transformation (CT) technique to design realistic adversarial patches that add subtle geometric distortions, then evaluated attack transferability across four fine-tuned ViT models on binary person classification tasks.

Result: Significant vulnerability variations observed: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with other models achieving 66.40% and 65.17%. Pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influenced model resilience.

Conclusion: Adversarial patches can successfully transfer from CNNs to ViTs, demonstrating cross-architectural vulnerability. ViT resilience to adversarial attacks is heavily dependent on pre-training characteristics, highlighting the need for improved security measures in ViT-based systems.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

### [126] [UniTransfer: Video Concept Transfer via Progressive Spatial and Timestep Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21086)
*Guojun Lei,Rong Zhang,Chi Wang,Tianhang Liu,Hong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniTransfer is a novel architecture for video concept transfer that uses spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition with a progressive paradigm for precise control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-quality and controllable video concept transfer by decomposing videos into key components and leveraging progressive guidance mechanisms.

Method: Spatial decomposition into foreground, background, and motion flow; dual-to-single-stream DiT architecture; self-supervised pretraining with random masking; Chain-of-Prompt mechanism for timestep decomposition using LLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in visual fidelity and editability compared to existing baselines across diverse reference images and scenes.

Conclusion: UniTransfer effectively achieves precise and controllable video concept transfer through its decomposition approach and progressive guidance, validated by the curated OpenAnimal dataset.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

*Ziang Yan,Xinhao Li,Yinan He,Zhengrong Yue,Xiangyu Zeng,Yali Wang,Yu Qiao,Limin Wang,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTTS enhances multimodal LLMs' reasoning through iterative perception during inference, mimicking human hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM methods are limited by static perception stages, lacking the dynamic reasoning capabilities needed for human-level perception and understanding.

Method: Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS) uses Iterative Perception mechanism with reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal supervision, supported by VTTS-80K dataset for iterative perception training.

Result: Videochat-R1.5 model achieved average 5%+ improvement over strong baselines across 15+ benchmarks covering video conversation, reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

Conclusion: VTTS enables MLLMs to enhance performance by increasing perceptual compute through iterative refinement, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

### [128] [Mammo-CLIP Dissect: A Framework for Analysing Mammography Concepts in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21102)
*Suaiba Amina Salahuddin,Teresa Dorszewski,Marit Almenning Martiniussen,Tone Hovda,Antonio Portaluri,Solveig Thrun,Michael Kampffmeyer,Elisabeth Wetzer,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect is a concept-based explainability framework that uses a mammography-specific vision-language model to analyze what deep learning models learn in mammography, revealing differences between general and domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding what DL models learn is essential for safe AI deployment in clinical settings, particularly for interpreting mammography models where textual concepts may better reflect clinical reasoning than pixel-based methods.

Method: Leverages Mammo-CLIP as a "dissector" to label neurons with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantify their alignment to domain knowledge. Investigates concept learning differences between general vs mammography-trained models, fine-tuning effects, and underrepresented concepts.

Result: Mammography-trained models capture more clinically relevant concepts and align better with radiologists' workflows. Fine-tuning enhances capture of certain concepts (benign calcifications) but reduces coverage of others (density features), showing a specialization-generalization trade-off.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how CNNs capture mammography knowledge, revealing how domain-specific training and task adaptation shape concept learning, with implications for safe clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

*Sicheng Tao,Jungang Li,Yibo Yan,Junyan Zhang,Yubo Gao,Hanqian Li,ShuHang Xun,Yuxuan Fan,Hong Chen,Jianxiang He,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV is a reinforcement learning framework with DTW-based process reward that improves video reasoning consistency in MLLMs by aligning reasoning traces with temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs exhibit process inconsistency where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when final answers are correct, undermining interpretability and robustness.

Method: Introduces a reinforcement learning framework with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward to align reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models.

Result: Achieves 87.2% on MOSS-Video test set, improves performance on general video benchmarks (MVBench, MMVU), and shows consistent gains across different architectures (Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-2). GPT-4o-as-judge evaluations confirm more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning and demonstrates broad applicability across different model architectures, producing more interpretable and robust reasoning.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

*Guojun Lei,Chi Wang,Yikai Wang,Hong Li,Ying Song,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for video generation guided by camera trajectories that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, using stable diffusion networks and semantic object priors to achieve superior consistency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with consistency and generalizability when generating videos with both camera and object motions, often learning motions separately which causes confusion about relative motion between camera and objects.

Method: Proposes integrating camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, using stable diffusion networks to learn reference motion maps relative to camera trajectories, and combining with semantic object priors in an image-to-video network.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in generating videos that accurately follow designated camera trajectories while maintaining consistent object motions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of generating consistent videos with both camera and object motions by unifying their representation as pixel motion, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

### [131] [CARINOX: Inference-time Scaling with Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17458)
*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,Shayan Baghayi Nejad,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARINOX is a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with principled reward selection to improve compositional alignment in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to achieve compositional alignment for complex prompts describing object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Existing inference-time approaches have limitations: optimization can stall due to poor initialization, while exploration requires too many samples. Neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all aspects of compositionality.

Method: CARINOX combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments. It addresses the limitations of using optimization or exploration alone by creating a unified framework that leverages both approaches effectively.

Result: CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories while preserving image quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed CARINOX framework effectively addresses compositional alignment challenges in text-to-image diffusion models by combining optimization and exploration with principled reward selection, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods on comprehensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

*Till Aczel,Lorenzo Vettor,Andreas Plesner,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes when discriminators are most disadvantaged in detecting AI-generated images, finding that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce detectability, while intermediate-complexity datasets are optimal for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred boundaries between synthetic and real images, creating an arms race between generators and discriminators. The research aims to understand the conditions where discriminators are most disadvantaged.

Method: The study analyzes two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, the researchers examine how different levels of complexity affect the detectability of synthetic images.

Result: Both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images - generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, while extreme diversity masks imperfections. Intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection.

Conclusion: The detectability of synthetic images follows a U-shaped curve relative to dataset complexity, with optimal detection occurring at intermediate complexity levels where generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

*Moshe Kimhi,Erez Koifman,Ehud Rivlin,Eli Schwartz,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAVECLIP is a unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP using wavelet-based tokenization, enabling dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs with early exits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient inference in vision-language models by supporting multiple resolutions within a single model and allowing adaptive computation based on confidence.

Method: Replaces standard patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, uses key-value caching and causal cross-level attention for computation reuse, and implements confidence-based gating for early exits.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings through lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP provides an effective approach for adaptive resolution inference that enables dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs using a single deployed model.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

*Aymen Bouguerra,Daniel Montoya,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Fabio Arnez,Chokri Mraidha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quantization of CLIP models can improve calibration for underconfident models and enhance OOD detection even when calibration degrades, with specific QAT methods achieving simultaneous gains in accuracy, calibration, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the impact of quantization on CLIP models beyond accuracy, focusing on reliability metrics like calibration and out-of-distribution detection, which are crucial for efficient and reliable deployment.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing in-distribution accuracy, calibration, and OOD detection, including analysis of quantization-aware training (QAT) methods.

Result: Quantization improves calibration for underconfident pre-trained models but may degrade it for overconfident ones; OOD detection can improve even with poor calibration; specific QAT methods yield simultaneous gains in accuracy, calibration, and robustness.

Conclusion: Quantization offers benefits beyond efficiency, enabling improved reliability and robustness in CLIP models, challenging the traditional efficiency-performance trade-off and providing insights for deploying efficient and reliable vision-language models.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET is a large-scale visual table understanding dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, featuring real-world table visualizations and paired image-HTML representations to address limitations of synthetic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual table understanding benchmarks use synthetic renderings lacking real-world complexity and visual diversity, and existing datasets offer fixed examples without access to underlying data for reformulation.

Method: Created TABLET dataset with 4M examples from 2M unique tables (88% preserving original visualizations), including paired image-HTML representations, metadata, and provenance information linking to source datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on both seen and unseen VTU tasks and increases robustness on real-world table visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models by preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conformal prediction-based approach for controlling explanation fidelity in feature attribution methods, identifying sufficient salient features to preserve model predictions without needing ground-truth explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods vary in robustness and may not faithfully reflect the underlying model's reasoning, requiring better control over explanation fidelity.

Method: Proposes four conformity functions to quantify how well explanations conform to model predictions, using conformal prediction to identify sufficient salient features without ground-truth explanations.

Result: FastSHAP consistently outperforms competing methods in fidelity and informational efficiency across five explainers and six image datasets, with super-pixel conformity measures being more effective than pixel-wise ones.

Conclusion: The conformal prediction approach successfully enables direct control over explanation fidelity and identifies efficient explanation regions, with super-pixel measures proving superior for practical applications.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

### [137] [Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21223)
*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma is a unified skeleton-based sign language understanding framework that addresses semantic grounding, local-global balance, and cross-modal learning challenges through sign-aware early fusion, hierarchical alignment, and unified pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skeleton-based SLU methods face three key limitations: weak semantic grounding (struggling to relate motion patterns to linguistic meaning), imbalance between local details and global context, and inefficient cross-modal learning for constructing semantically aligned representations.

Method: Proposes Sigma framework with: 1) sign-aware early fusion mechanism for deep visual-textual interaction, 2) hierarchical alignment learning strategy to maximize agreements across different feature levels, and 3) unified pre-training combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of semantically informative pre-training and proves skeletal data as a stand-alone solution for SLU, showing significant impact on sign language understanding tasks.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive study evaluating how well automated metrics for text-image generation align with human judgment, revealing that no single metric performs consistently across different compositional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-image generation evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics that are often adopted by convention rather than being validated against human judgment, creating a critical need to understand their alignment with human preferences.

Method: The study conducts a broad analysis of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments.

Result: No single metric performs consistently across tasks - performance varies with compositional problem type. VQA-based metrics are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics contribute little to compositional evaluation.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of careful and transparent metric selection for trustworthy evaluation and their use as reward models in generation, highlighting that metric performance is task-dependent rather than universally consistent.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

TL;DR: SlideMamba integrates Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks for Whole Slide Image analysis, using entropy-based adaptive fusion to balance local and global dependencies, achieving superior performance in predicting gene fusion/mutation status.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalizable deep learning framework that captures both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies in Whole Slide Images for enhanced computational pathology analysis.

Method: Combines Mamba modules for long-range global dependencies and GNNs for fine-grained short-range spatial interactions, with an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism for adaptive fusion of complementary signals.

Result: Achieves PRAUC of 0.751 ± 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491), Trans-MIL (0.39), Mamba-only (0.664), GNN-only (0.748), and GAT-Mamba (0.703), with competitive ROC AUC (0.738), sensitivity (0.662), and specificity (0.725).

Conclusion: The integrated architecture with entropy-based adaptive fusion demonstrates strong performance and promising potential for spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation that accepts multiple conditioning signals beyond just images and text, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D generative models rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption in production workflows.

Method: Built on Hunyuan3D 2.1, the framework unifies multiple conditioning signals (point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, skeletal pose) in a single cross-modal architecture using progressive difficulty-aware sampling that biases toward harder signals while handling missing inputs gracefully.

Result: Experiments show that additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

Conclusion: The unified multi-modal approach provides enhanced controllability and practical adoption for 3D asset generation in games, film, and design applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

TL;DR: A framework using vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps via natural language prompts, which guides CNNs to make more reliable decisions without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often exploit superficial correlations instead of making predictions for the right reasons. Existing methods require labor-intensive expert annotations, limiting scalability.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts, and introduce an auxiliary loss to align CNN attention with these language-guided maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, showing improved generalization and reduced shortcut reliance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making in CNNs without requiring manual annotation, making it scalable and effective.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQ-InstructBLIP improves vision-language reasoning by generating image-aware sub-questions and answers through a three-component architecture (Questioner, Answerer, Reasoner) to overcome limitations of black-box LLMs in multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based approaches struggle with multi-step reasoning in vision-language tasks due to inability to access fine-grained visual content and the black-box nature of LLMs, making them difficult to reproduce and understand.

Method: Proposed SQ-InstructBLIP with three components sharing the same architecture: Questioner generates sub-questions, Answerer provides sub-answers, and Reasoner performs final reasoning using the generated sub-question information for VQA tasks.

Result: Experiments show SQ-InstructBLIP performs more accurate reasoning than previous works by using generated sub-questions as additional information when solving VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of black-box LLMs by enabling image-aware iterative sub-question generation, leading to improved multi-step reasoning performance in vision-language understanding.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

### [144] [Hallucination as an Upper Bound: A New Perspective on Text-to-Image Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21257)
*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for defining and categorizing hallucination in text-to-image models as bias-driven deviations, introducing three types: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of text-to-image models focus mainly on alignment with prompts but overlook what models generate beyond prompts, failing to address bias-driven hallucinations that reveal underlying model biases.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy with three categories of hallucination: attribute hallucinations (incorrect attributes), relation hallucinations (incorrect relationships), and object hallucinations (unprompted objects), establishing an upper bound for evaluation.

Result: This framing surfaces hidden biases in text-to-image models and provides a foundation for richer assessment beyond simple prompt alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy offers a systematic way to evaluate hallucination in text-to-image models, revealing model biases and enabling more comprehensive model assessment.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization to address inter-person variability in micro-action recognition, achieving better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-action recognition methods fail in real-world scenarios due to inter-person variability causing the same action to manifest differently, hindering robust generalization.

Method: Framework with two plug-and-play components: Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module (temporal branch with Wasserstein-regularized alignment and frequency branch with variance-guided perturbations) and Group-Invariant Regularized Loss (pseudo-group partitioning with boundary case up-weighting and subgroup variance regularization).

Result: Experiments on MA-52 dataset show the framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses person-specific variations in micro-action recognition through feature-level and loss-level optimizations, enabling robust generalization to unseen person distributions.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for semantic matching that addresses geometric ambiguity and nearest-neighbor rule limitations by adapting 3D geometric foundation model VGGT for cross-instance semantic matching under data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic matching methods suffer from geometric ambiguity (failing to disambiguate symmetric structures using 2D features) and nearest-neighbor rule limitations (ignoring cross-image invisibility and manifold preservation).

Method: The approach adapts VGGT by: (i) retaining early feature stages, fine-tuning later ones, and adding semantic head for bidirectional correspondences; (ii) using cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training with aliasing artifact mitigation under data scarcity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation, outperforming previous baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses key limitations in semantic matching by leveraging 3D geometric foundation models and adapting them effectively for cross-instance matching scenarios with limited data.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution medical videos are crucial for accurate diagnosis but hard to acquire due to hardware limitations. Current VSR models struggle with medical video challenges like camera shake, noise, abrupt frame transitions, and produce artifacts that can mislead doctors.

Method: Proposes MedVSR with two key components: Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) for precise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices, and Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) for enhancing tissue structures through joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation.

Result: Experiments across four medical datasets (including endoscopy and cataract surgeries) show MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in both reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MedVSR provides an effective solution for medical video super-resolution, addressing unique challenges in medical imaging and producing high-quality results that can aid accurate clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in multimodal reasoning models by proposing Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) for stable RL fine-tuning, releasing large-scale curated CoT data, and open-sourcing multimodal reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large multimodal reasoning models face two major constraints: lack of open, high-quality long chain-of-thought data and instability of RL algorithms in post-training due to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low.

Method: Proposes Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) using Variance Promotion Score to combine outcome variance and trajectory diversity; releases ~1.6M long CoT data and ~15k RL QA pairs; open-sources multimodal reasoning models with reproducible training codebase.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of both curated data and VAS. Theoretical analysis shows reward variance lower-bounds expected policy gradient magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed VAS stabilizes policy optimization, and the released resources establish standardized baselines for the community, with comprehensive ablation studies validating each component's contributions.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Motivation: Foundation models can overcome data scarcity in ocean science where labeled data is sparse and expensive, enabling better AI applications for marine monitoring.

Method: Used Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture pre-trained on Sentinel-3 OLCI data, then fine-tuned on two downstream tasks: chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.

Result: The model demonstrated utility for marine monitoring, effectively using small labeled datasets and capturing detailed spatial patterns while matching point observations.

Conclusion: Geospatial AI foundation models have potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE is a training-free framework for high-fidelity image composition that addresses complex lighting challenges and diverse high-resolution inputs using diffusion models without latent inversion or attention surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image composition models struggle with complex lighting conditions (accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse high-resolution inputs, while current diffusion models lack proper frameworks to utilize their physical and resolution priors effectively.

Method: SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss using pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. It also includes degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending to eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams.

Result: Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SHINE provides an effective training-free solution for high-quality image composition that handles complex lighting and resolution challenges, with the introduced ComplexCompo benchmark addressing the lack of rigorous evaluation standards in the field.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

<details>

Motivation: Billion-scale VGGTs face prohibitive computational and memory costs that hinder real-world deployment. PTQ struggles with VGGTs due to data-independent special tokens causing heavy-tailed distributions and multi-view 3D data making calibration unstable.

Method: Proposes QuantVGGT with two key techniques: 1) Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization using pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing, 2) Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling that filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse calibration clusters.

Result: QuantVGGT achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and bit-widths, with 4-bit quantization delivering 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration while maintaining >98% reconstruction accuracy compared to full-precision models.

Conclusion: QuantVGGT demonstrates significant advantages for resource-constrained scenarios, making billion-scale VGGTs practically deployable with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

*Yu Yuan,Xijun Wang,Tharindu Wickremasinghe,Zeeshan Nadir,Bole Ma,Stanley H. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles to address physical inconsistency in text-to-video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack parameter control due to learning motion distributions solely from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.

Method: Proposes NewtonGen framework with trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) that models Newtonian motions and injects latent dynamical constraints into video generation.

Result: Enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control by jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance.

Conclusion: Integrating learnable physical principles with data-driven synthesis addresses fundamental limitations in current text-to-video generation models.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

*Yandan Yang,Baoxiong Jia,Shujie Zhang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SceneWeaver is a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement for indoor scene generation, outperforming prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current indoor scene synthesis approaches are constrained to fixed categories, lack object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle with complex user instructions, despite the growing importance of realistic 3D environments for Embodied AI.

Method: SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner that selects from extensible scene generation tools (data-driven generative models, visual- and LLM-based methods) in a closed-loop reason-act-reflect design, enabling iterative refinement through self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show SceneWeaver outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, and generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions across common and open-vocabulary room types.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver represents a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation by unifying diverse synthesis paradigms through agentic iterative refinement, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ArtUV is an automated end-to-end method for generating artist-style UV unwrapping that addresses limitations of existing methods like fragmentation and lack of semantic coherence by simulating professional UV mapping through two stages: semantic seam prediction and artist-style parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming processes, fragmentation, lack of semantic meaning, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use in professional rendering pipelines where artist-style UV maps require clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and semantic coherence.

Method: ArtUV divides UV mapping into two stages: 1) SeamGPT for semantically meaningful cutting seam prediction, and 2) an Auto-Encoder that refines rough UV from optimization-based methods into artist-style UV maps while preserving topological structure and semantic consistency.

Result: ArtUV generates high-quality artist-style UV maps that ensure semantic consistency, preserve topological structure, and are ready for 2D editing. It functions as both a plug-in for professional rendering tools and a standalone system for rapid UV generation.

Conclusion: ArtUV provides a versatile automated solution for professional-quality UV unwrapping that overcomes limitations of traditional methods by incorporating semantic understanding and artist-style optimization, making it suitable for integration into production pipelines.

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SeamCrafter is an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator that produces high-quality mesh seams with lower distortion and fragmentation than previous methods, using a dual-branch point-cloud encoder and DPO fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poorly placed mesh seams cause severe UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, hindering texture synthesis and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods trade off between high distortion and many scattered islands.

Method: Uses an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator conditioned on point cloud inputs with a dual-branch point-cloud encoder that captures topological and geometric cues. Fine-tuned using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference dataset from a novel seam-evaluation framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: SeamCrafter effectively addresses the trade-off between distortion and fragmentation in mesh seam generation, providing superior seam quality for UV parametrization and texture mapping applications.

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

*Jiabao Lei,Kewei Shi,Zhihao Liang,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Progressive auto-regressive mesh generation using simplicial complexes and transformer models to create 3D meshes in a coarse-to-fine manner, reversing mesh simplification processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-regressive mesh generation models build meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which doesn't effectively capture geometry in a human-perceptible way. Inspired by progressive 2D image generation models.

Method: Generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR model that approximates the reverse process of mesh simplification. Starts from a single point and gradually adds geometric details through local remeshing with alterable topology.

Result: The progressive approach provides intuitive control over generation quality and time consumption via early stopping, and enables applications like mesh refinement and editing.

Conclusion: Progressive mesh generation offers superior geometric representation compared to traditional AR methods while maintaining the benefits of sharpness, compactness, and surface representation capabilities.

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VR/MR/AR systems for architecture are developed case-by-case with hard-coded annotations that don't scale across diverse built environments, limiting accessibility and creative workflows.

Method: Created Arch-300K dataset (315K image-question-answer triplets) using a multi-stage pipeline: curated architectural images via coarse-to-fine filtering with 3D reconstruction and segmentation, used LLM-guided text verification to generate reliable QA pairs, and synthesized formal analysis annotations. Fine-tuned ShareGPT4V-7B on this dataset.

Result: Developed ArchGPT, a domain-specialized multimodal VQA model for architecture that can provide scalable, intelligent interactions in VR/MR/AR systems.

Conclusion: ArchGPT addresses the scalability limitations of traditional architectural VR/MR/AR systems by providing a data-driven approach that can generalize across diverse architectural environments through high-quality domain-specific training data.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

TL;DR: A novel analytical method for extracting surfaces from neural implicit functions that avoids spatial discretization limitations of traditional methods like Marching Cubes, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining competitive speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional surface extraction methods rely on spatial decomposition and sampling, leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. Efficient and accurate conversion between implicit and explicit 3D representations is crucial for 3D visual computing.

Method: Leverages the fact that each neuron partitions the domain and develops a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the encoded surface. The method operates natively in parallel and can handle large neural architectures without spatial discretization.

Result: The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric information from neural networks, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while maintaining competitive speed.

Conclusion: This analytical approach provides superior surface extraction from neural implicit functions compared to conventional sampling-based methods, offering both high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CHARM is a novel parametric representation and generative framework for anime hairstyle modeling that uses a compact control-point-based parameterization and autoregressive transformer to generate high-fidelity anime hairstyles from images or point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hair modeling methods focus on realistic hair but struggle with anime hairstyles' highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry. Existing approaches using dense mesh modeling or hand-crafted spline curves are inefficient for editing and unsuitable for scalable learning.

Method: CHARM introduces a compact, invertible control-point-based parameterization where each hair card is represented by a sequence of control points with only five geometric parameters. It uses an autoregressive generative framework that treats anime hairstyles as a sequential 'hair language', capturing both local geometry and global topology.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generation quality. A large-scale dataset called AnimeHair with 37K high-quality anime hairstyles was created to facilitate training and evaluation.

Conclusion: CHARM offers an expressive and scalable solution for anime hairstyle modeling that supports both artist-friendly design and learning-based generation, addressing the limitations of traditional hair modeling approaches for stylized anime content.

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime

Conclusion: CATCH-FM demonstrates robust cancer risk prediction across patient distributions, benefits from ICD code space operation, and captures non-trivial risk factors, showing promise for accessible early cancer detection.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation

millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain

them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative

*Wenkai Guo,Xuefeng Liu,Haolin Wang,Jianwei Niu,Shaojie Tang,Jing Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that federated learning (FL) for fine-tuning LLMs still poses privacy risks, as attackers can extract training data from the global model, with leakage increasing with model size. The authors propose an enhanced FL-specific attack and evaluate mitigation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations want to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs using their local data but are reluctant to share data directly. While FL is seen as privacy-preserving, the paper investigates whether it truly protects against data leakage in LLM fine-tuning scenarios.

Method: The authors conduct extensive experiments showing data extraction from FL-trained global models using straightforward generation methods. They introduce an enhanced attack strategy that tracks global model updates during FL training to intensify privacy leakage.

Result: Results show that attackers can extract training data from FL-trained global models, with leakage severity increasing as model size grows. The enhanced FL-specific attack further intensifies privacy risks.

Conclusion: FL for LLM fine-tuning has significant privacy risks. The paper provides practical guidelines for mitigating these risks through techniques like differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates, and safety-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

*Zhenpeng Su,Leiyu Pan,Minxuan Lv,Yuntao Li,Wenping Hu,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-GPPO is a novel RL algorithm that preserves gradients from clipped tokens in PPO to better control entropy dynamics and improve exploration-exploitation balance in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like PPO discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to clipping, which overlooks their critical role in regulating entropy evolution during LLM training.

Method: CE-GPPO gently reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a bounded manner, controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval to achieve better exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales, effectively mitigating entropy instability.

Conclusion: The proposed CE-GPPO algorithm provides theoretical and empirical evidence for better entropy control in RL-based LLM optimization, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

*Junyu Guo,Shangding Gu,Ming Jin,Costas Spanos,Javad Lavaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StyleBench is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating five reasoning styles (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) across diverse tasks and models, revealing that no single style is universally optimal and strategy effectiveness depends on model scale and task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of LLMs is heavily influenced by reasoning strategies in prompts, but the interplay between reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood.

Method: Assessed five reasoning styles on five reasoning tasks using 15 open-source models (270M to 120B parameters) from major families including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek.

Result: No single reasoning style is universally optimal. Search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Smaller models often fail to follow instructions and default to guessing.

Conclusion: Reasoning strategy effectiveness is highly contingent on model scale and task type, providing a roadmap for selecting optimal strategies based on specific constraints.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in

### [165] [CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)
*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLUE is a framework for LLM unlearning that uses circuit discovery to precisely identify and separate forget and retain neurons, then applies targeted fine-tuning strategies to achieve better unlearning performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current localization-based unlearning methods fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge from those needed to retain essential skills, leading to either catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure.

Method: Proposes CLUE framework that: 1) identifies forget and retain circuits using mechanistic interpretability, 2) transforms circuits into conjunctive normal forms (CNF), 3) determines neuron assignments through CNF satisfiability solutions, 4) applies targeted fine-tuning strategies based on neuron categories.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility compared to existing localization methods through precise neural localization.

Conclusion: The conflict-guided localization approach enables more precise and effective LLM unlearning by properly separating forget and retain circuits, addressing limitations of current entangled neuron treatment methods.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

### [166] [Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Brian M. Kurkoski,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Binary Autoencoder (BAE) to improve feature sparsity and atomization in LLM interpretation by enforcing minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations using 1-bit discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoder methods for LLM interpretation produce dense features due to lack of global sparsity guarantees, harming feature sparsity and atomization.

Method: Binary Autoencoder (BAE) enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations by discretizing to 1-bit via step function with gradient estimation for backpropagation.

Result: BAE enables reliable feature set entropy calculation and produces more interpretable features with better sparsity compared to baselines.

Conclusion: BAE effectively serves as a feature extractor by avoiding dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable features, confirming its effectiveness for LLM interpretation.

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

### [167] [Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates In-context Learning (ICL) mechanism through information removal, showing that LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in zero-shot scenarios, and few-shot ICL effectively removes redundant information to steer models toward intended tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inner mechanism of In-context Learning (ICL) in modern Language Models, which remains unclear despite its effectiveness as a few-shot learning paradigm.

Method: The study uses information removal perspective, measuring hidden states with carefully designed metrics, identifying Denoising Heads that induce removal operations, and conducting ablation experiments by blocking information removal from inference.

Result: Few-shot ICL simulates task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing redundant information from entangled representations. Blocking Denoising Heads significantly degrades ICL accuracy, especially when correct labels are absent from demonstrations.

Conclusion: Information removal constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL, with Denoising Heads playing a critical role in selectively removing task-irrelevant information to improve model performance on intended tasks.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

*Yiyou Sun,Yuhan Cao,Pohao Huang,Haoyue Bai,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Nouha Dziri,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTA-Code is a synthetic coding benchmark that tests whether LLMs can learn new reasoning strategies through RL, showing a grokking phase transition from near-zero to near-perfect accuracy after extended training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can genuinely acquire new reasoning skills beyond their pre-trained capabilities, particularly in algorithmic coding problems where pretrained models fail.

Method: Uses controlled synthetic coding problems with templated generators, RL training with techniques like staged warm-up, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop to enable learning on previously unsolvable problems.

Result: Models exhibit a striking grokking phase transition - after extended near-zero reward periods, they abruptly achieve near-perfect accuracy. Solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases.

Conclusion: DELTA provides a clean testbed for probing RL-driven reasoning limits and understanding how models can acquire new algorithmic skills beyond existing priors.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

### [169] [ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21070)
*Qizhi Pei,Zhuoshi Pan,Honglin Lin,Xin Gao,Yu Li,Zinan Tang,Conghui He,Rui Yan,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff is a pipeline that efficiently identifies difficult math problems from existing datasets and trains a specialized generator to create new difficult problems at scale, enabling cost-effective improvement of Large Reasoning Models' performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for automated synthesis of mathematical problems face limitations in scalability due to high computational/API costs, complex prompting requirements, and limited difficulty levels of generated problems.

Method: The pipeline uses an adaptive thinking model to identify difficult problems with a single forward pass, then trains a specialized generator (DiffGen-8B) on the filtered difficult data to produce new problems without complex prompting or high API costs.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset achieved 11.3% performance improvement over the original dataset and 65.9% average accuracy on multiple difficult benchmarks, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff demonstrates effective transfer of advanced reasoning capabilities using cost-efficient models, showing clear scaling benefits as difficult problem quantity increases, without relying on expensive teacher models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE is a rule-guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain-specific constraints into representation learning using VAE architecture with LLM-generated rules and knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods rely only on data similarity and lack ability to capture structural/semantic constraints critical in many domains, limiting operational meaningfulness of clusters.

Method: Extends VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data features into unified latent space. Uses LLM-generated rules structured into knowledge graphs, enforced through loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties.

Result: Experiments on aircraft/automotive datasets show more operationally meaningful clusters (e.g., isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, separating SUVs from sedans) while improving traditional clustering metrics.

Conclusion: DARTVAE achieves more meaningful clustering than purely data-driven models by combining rule encodings with learned representations, though faces challenges with LLM rule hallucinations, conflicts, overfitting, and computational scaling.

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bispectral Optimal Transport is a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that uses bispectrum representations to preserve data structure while removing group action variations, achieving better class preservation than naive OT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimal transport alignments based solely on pairwise geometric distances can ignore intrinsic coherence structure in symmetry-rich settings, leading to poor class preservation.

Method: Introduces Bispectral Optimal Transport that compares elements using their bispectrum representation - a group Fourier invariant that preserves signal structure while removing variation due to group actions.

Result: Empirical results show Bispectral OT achieves greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets with visual symmetries, producing more meaningful correspondences that capture semantic label structure.

Conclusion: Bispectral OT improves the quality of correspondences by removing nuisance variations not affecting class or content while preserving underlying semantic structure in symmetric datasets.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FERD is a fairness-enhanced data-free robustness distillation framework that addresses robust fairness issues by adjusting adversarial example proportion and distribution to improve worst-class robustness across categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free robustness distillation methods overlook robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories, with students showing different behavior across categories and unstable robustness across attack targets.

Method: FERD uses robustness-guided class reweighting to synthesize more samples for less robust categories, generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) with uniformity constraints on feature-level predictions, and constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) with uniform target class constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets show FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attacks, improving worst-class robustness by 15.1% under FGSM and 6.4% under AutoAttack using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FERD demonstrates superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects, effectively addressing the robust fairness gap in data-free robustness distillation.

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench is a large-scale, real-world benchmark for context-aware time series captioning, addressing limitations of existing synthetic datasets by incorporating metadata, visual representations, and diverse evaluation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series captioning benchmarks rely on synthetic data or simplistic captions, and neglect metadata and visual representations, creating a gap in realistic evaluation.

Method: Created from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A tasks, with 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Uses a scalable pipeline with LLM-generated captions verified through factual checks, human studies, and diversity analyses, plus human-refined subset.

Result: Established CaTS-Bench as a reliable benchmark with 460 multiple-choice questions for deeper reasoning. Benchmarking revealed both strengths and limitations of leading VLMs in time series analysis.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench provides an extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models, with new tailored evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A masked transformer-based autoencoder approach for reconstructing missing fetal heart rate (FHR) signals, addressing data gaps caused by sensor displacement during maternal movement in wearable FHR monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Approximately 10% of newborns need breathing assistance at birth, and FHR monitoring is crucial for fetal well-being assessment. However, wearable FHR monitors suffer from signal dropouts due to maternal movement, limiting AI-based analysis and risk prediction capabilities.

Method: Proposed a masked transformer-based autoencoder that captures both spatial and frequency components of FHR data to reconstruct missing signals, enabling robust handling of varying missing data durations for signal inpainting and forecasting.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness across different durations of missing data and can be used for both signal reconstruction and forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: The approach can be applied retrospectively to research datasets for AI-based risk algorithm development and potentially integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices for earlier and more robust risk detection.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

*Killian Steunou,Sigurd Saue,Théo Druilhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using sparse PCA (SPCA) as a defense against adversarial attacks, showing it provides better robustness than standard PCA while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and the authors want to explore simple, data-adapted defenses using linear dimensionality reduction methods.

Method: Empirical comparison of PCA and SPCA as front-end feature extractors, complemented by theoretical analysis including robustness certificates for linear heads and Lipschitz composition arguments for non-linear heads.

Result: SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Theoretical analysis shows sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage.

Conclusion: Sparsity in projections reduces adversarial sensitivity, and this benefit persists beyond linear settings, making SPCA a promising defense mechanism against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

TL;DR: A unified f-divergence framework for machine unlearning in diffusion models that generalizes MSE-based approaches and allows selecting optimal divergences for specific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for text-to-image models rely on minimizing MSE between output distributions, but this is limited and may not be optimal for all applications.

Method: Propose a unified f-divergence-based framework where any f-divergence can be used instead of just MSE, analyzing benefits of different divergences for convergence and unlearning quality.

Result: The framework provides flexibility to select optimal divergence for specific applications, balancing trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed unified f-divergence framework offers a more flexible and effective approach for machine unlearning in diffusion models compared to MSE-based methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Motivation: Existing deep learning methods fail in long-term turbulence forecasting due to catastrophic error accumulation and inability to capture both local dissipative effects and global non-local interactions simultaneously.

Method: DINO uses parallel branches: a constrained convolutional network for local differential operator (proven to converge to derivative) and a Transformer architecture for global integral operator (learning data-driven global kernel).

Result: DINO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, suppressing error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps while maintaining high fidelity in vorticity fields and energy spectra.

Conclusion: DINO establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecasting through its physics-based operator decomposition approach.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transparency and accountability in AI system development and deployment by providing comprehensive safety and security tracking throughout the system lifecycle.

Method: Proposes a framework that integrates dynamic security/safety records with standardized identifiers (including novel AI Safety Hazard ID) to complement existing security identifiers like CVEs.

Result: Creates a single accessible source of truth for AI system safety that enables better decision-making by developers and stakeholders.

Conclusion: HASC framework complements ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and provides greater transparency and accountability for AI systems through standardized hazard communication.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater
transparency and accountability for AI systems.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RadAgents is a multi-agent framework for chest X-ray interpretation that addresses limitations in clinical interpretability, multimodal fusion, and verification mechanisms by integrating clinical priors with task-aware reasoning and conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic systems for CXR interpretation lack clinically interpretable reasoning, proper multimodal fusion, and mechanisms to detect/resolve inconsistencies, leading to unreliable outputs that don't align with clinical guidelines.

Method: Multi-agent framework that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning, integrating grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts.

Result: The system produces more reliable, transparent outputs that are consistent with clinical practice through improved reasoning and conflict resolution mechanisms.

Conclusion: RadAgents bridges critical gaps in CXR interpretation by providing clinically aligned, multimodal reasoning with principled verification, representing a significant advancement over existing methods.

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

### [182] [CLAUSE: Agentic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Dynamic Learnable Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21035)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is a neuro-symbolic framework that treats knowledge graph context construction as a sequential decision process, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and cost trade-offs through multi-agent coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like static k-hop expansions and prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and have unpredictable runtime, failing to balance accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance.

Method: CLAUSE uses Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) to coordinate three agents (Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, Context Curator) for joint optimization of subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection under user-specified resource budgets.

Result: Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE achieves higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, it achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth compared to GraphRAG.

Conclusion: CLAUSE provides compact, provenance-preserving contexts with predictable performance under deployment constraints, enabling per-query adaptation to accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs without retraining.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

### [183] [Disagreements in Reasoning: How a Model's Thinking Process Dictates Persuasion in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21054)
*Haodong Zhao,Jidong Li,Zhaomin Wu,Tianjie Ju,Zhuosheng Zhang,Bingsheng He,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper challenges the hypothesis that persuasive efficacy in Multi-Agent Systems depends on model scale, proposing instead that cognitive processes and reasoning capacity are key factors. It identifies a 'Persuasion Duality' where reasoning models are more resistant to persuasion but become more persuasive when their reasoning is transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems where LLMs and LRMs collaborate, challenging the prevailing belief that model scale determines persuasive power and instead focusing on cognitive processes.

Method: Conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments, analyzed reasoning transparency effects, and studied complex transmission persuasion scenarios in multi-hop agent networks.

Result: Found that reasoning models are more resistant to persuasion but become significantly more persuasive when their reasoning process is shared. Complex influence propagation and decay patterns were observed in multi-agent networks.

Conclusion: A model's internal processing architecture directly influences its external persuasive behavior, with important implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future Multi-Agent Systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

*Yidong Wang,Yunze Song,Tingyuan Zhu,Xuanwang Zhang,Zhuohao Yu,Hao Chen,Chiyu Song,Qiufeng Wang,Cunxiang Wang,Zhen Wu,Xinyu Dai,Yue Zhang,Wei Ye,Shikun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrustJudge is a probabilistic framework that addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation systems through distribution-sensitive scoring and likelihood-aware aggregation, reducing Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks suffer from critical inconsistencies including Score-Comparison Inconsistency (lower-rated responses outperforming higher-scored ones) and Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency (circular preference chains and equivalence contradictions).

Method: TrustJudge uses: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities to preserve information entropy, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity.

Result: When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency from 23.32% to 14.89% (8.43% improvement) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency from 15.22% to 4.40% (10.82% improvement), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: TrustJudge provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

### [185] [Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21124)
*Xuemiao Zhang,Can Ren,Chengying Tu,Rongxiang Weng,Shuo Wang,Hongfei Yan,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance reasoning models by selectively using high-value chain-of-thought (CoT) data based on reasoning patterns, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use CoT data indiscriminately, but it's unclear which data types most effectively enhance reasoning capabilities. The paper aims to identify and utilize high-value reasoning patterns to improve model performance.

Method: The authors define reasoning potential as the inverse of attempts needed to answer correctly. They abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, create a core reference set, and use a dual-granularity algorithm (chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy) to select high-value CoT data (CoTP) that aligns with the core set.

Result: Using only 10B-token CoTP data, the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts model improved by 9.58% on AIME 2024 and 2025, and raised the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective use of high-value reasoning patterns in CoT data significantly enhances model reasoning capabilities and performance, demonstrating the importance of data quality over quantity in training reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: VC-Agent successfully expedites the video collection process by providing an interactive system that understands user queries and adaptively retrieves/scales up relevant video clips with minimal user input.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly

TL;DR: A novel optimal transport-based approach for blind hyperspectral unmixing that constrains abundance distributions to resemble targeted Dirichlet distributions using OT discrepancy as regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing by better estimating endmembers through distributional constraints.

Method: Uses optimal transport to measure discrepancy between targeted and true abundance distributions, incorporating this as a regularization term in an optimization problem. Demonstrated through unsupervised deep learning.

Result: The approach allows for better estimation of endmembers in highly mixed data scenarios and shows robustness to the choice of target abundance distribution.

Conclusion: The optimal transport-based regularization method effectively handles highly mixed hyperspectral data and improves endmember estimation while maintaining distributional robustness.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a new paradigm that enables natural language commands in recommendation systems to address limitations of traditional passive feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems rely on coarse-grained feedback signals (like/dislike) that fail to capture nuanced user motivations and intentions, creating a gap between user intentions and system interpretations that undermines user satisfaction.

Method: Developed RecBot, a dual-agent architecture with a Parser Agent that transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent that dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for real-time policy adjustment. Used simulation-augmented knowledge distillation for efficient deployment.

Result: Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot demonstrated significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Conclusion: The IRF paradigm with RecBot successfully addresses limitations of traditional recommendation systems by enabling active explicit control through natural language commands, bridging the gap between user intentions and system interpretations.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

TL;DR: A convolutional U-Net surrogate model for liquid metal dealloying that enables 16,000x faster simulations while maintaining accuracy, with physics-aware design for spatial and temporal extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase-field models for liquid metal dealloying become computationally intractable for large domains and long time horizons, requiring surrogate models to enable practical simulations.

Method: Conditionally parameterized fully convolutional U-Net with convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, trained on short small-scale simulations but capable of temporal and spatial extrapolation through parameter conditioning.

Result: Achieves relative errors under 5% within training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times, with 16,000x speedup compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: The method represents an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models, enabling simulations that previously took weeks to be completed in seconds.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Motivation: Current synthetic data generation for code LLMs relies on model-generated verification, creating a bottleneck where verifier limitations constrain training data quality and diversity. This 'verification ceiling' prevents models from reaching their full potential.

Method: Systematic study of verification design: (i) test complexity vs quantity analysis, (ii) exploration of relaxed pass thresholds and LLM-based soft verification, (iii) controlled comparisons of correct/incorrect solutions and human evaluation.

Result: Richer test suites improve code generation (+3 pass@1), rigid 100% pass criteria are overly restrictive, relaxed thresholds recover valuable training data (2-4 point pass@1 improvement), and diverse correct solutions yield consistent generalization gains.

Conclusion: Verification cannot be discarded but must be recalibrated. Combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs can break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

### [192] [On Theoretical Interpretations of Concept-Based In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20882)
*Huaze Tang,Tianren Peng,Shao-lun Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper proposes theoretical analyses for concept-based in-context learning (CB-ICL), explaining why and when it performs well with few demonstrations, quantifying knowledge transfer, and providing insights for model pre-training and prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical understanding of in-context learning mechanisms in large language models remains limited, despite its importance in NLP applications.

Method: The authors propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, develop a similarity measure between demonstrations and query inputs, and conduct real-data experiments to validate their theory.

Result: The theory explains CB-ICL's performance with few demonstrations, quantifies knowledge leverage, and provides guidance for pre-training and prompt engineering. Experiments validate the practical usefulness.

Conclusion: The proposed CB-ICL theory offers important insights into ICL mechanisms and provides quantitative guidance for improving LLM performance through better pre-training and prompt design strategies.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Perspectra is an interactive multi-agent system that visualizes deliberation among LLM agents through a forum-style interface with @-mentions, threading, and real-time mind maps to support critical thinking in research proposal development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems enable information search and ideation but lack effective tools for users to control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among multiple domain-expert agents.

Method: Developed Perspectra with forum-style interface supporting @-mention invitations, threading for parallel exploration, and real-time mind map visualization. Conducted within-subjects study with 18 participants comparing Perspectra to group-chat baseline for research proposal development.

Result: Perspectra significantly increased critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions compared to group chat. Users demonstrated deeper engagement with arguments and rationales.

Conclusion: Multi-agent tools should support user control over adversarial discourse through visualization and structured interfaces to scaffold critical thinking effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent
adversarial discourse.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study analyzes how credibility is packaged in nutrition and supplement videos on short-form platforms by examining authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization strategies across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-form video platforms have become central for health advice but mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than judging truth, the research aims to understand how credibility is constructed in nutrition and supplement videos.

Method: Researchers assembled a cross-platform corpus of 152 public videos and annotated them on 26 features covering visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative strategies, and engagement cues. They used an annotation pipeline with automatic speech recognition, frame selection, and multimodal modeling, with human verification showing strong agreement.

Result: Confident single presenters in studio/home settings dominate, with rare clinical contexts. Authority cues (titles, slides, certificates) frequently co-occur with persuasive elements (jargon, fear tactics, critiques of mainstream medicine) and monetization (sales links, subscription calls). Science-like visuals often accompany emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Conclusion: Credibility in health videos is packaged through a combination of authority signals with persuasive and monetization elements, where scientific-looking elements often serve emotive and oppositional narratives rather than indicating factual restraint.

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Automotive-ENV, the first benchmark for vehicle GUI interactions, and ASURADA, a geo-aware multimodal agent that improves safety-aware task performance using location-based context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal agents have shown strong GUI interaction capabilities but haven't been adequately explored for automotive systems, which present unique challenges like limited driver attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interactions.

Method: The authors created Automotive-ENV, a high-fidelity benchmark with 185 parameterized tasks across explicit control, implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware categories. They then developed ASURADA, a geo-aware multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving norms.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that geo-aware information significantly improves success rates on safety-aware tasks, showing the importance of location-based context in automotive environments.

Conclusion: The research highlights the critical role of location-aware context in automotive GUI interactions and provides a comprehensive benchmark (Automotive-ENV) that will be released to advance the development of safe and adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Method: The framework pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in a graph structure, uses separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature processing, and employs graph-based architecture to enhance feature aggregation in sparse radar data for improved inter-frame correspondence.

Result: Experiments on open-source and self-collected datasets show Equi-RO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation accuracy respectively compared to the best baseline on the open-source dataset.

Conclusion: Equi-RO demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness for 4D radar odometry, making it a promising solution for autonomous navigation in challenging weather conditions where traditional sensors fail.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation

*Wei-Teng Chu,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FINS is a lightweight framework for fast neural surface reconstruction from single or few images, achieving high-fidelity results with rapid convergence using multi-resolution hash grids and foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit surface reconstruction methods like NeuS require large multi-view image sets and long training times, limiting practical applications. FINS aims to enable efficient surface reconstruction from minimal input.

Method: Integrates multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry/color heads, uses approximate second-order optimizer for fast convergence, and leverages pre-trained foundation models to estimate geometry from single RGB images.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in convergence speed and accuracy for surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation, achieving results within seconds rather than typical long training times.

Conclusion: FINS demonstrates practical applicability for robotics tasks like surface following and scales well across various benchmark datasets, offering an efficient alternative to traditional implicit surface reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

TL;DR: RAM-NAS is a resource-aware multi-objective neural architecture search method that improves supernet pretraining and optimizes for robot hardware resources using mutual distillation and latency predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NAS approaches are insufficient for training supernets and ignore actual robot hardware resource constraints, creating a need for hardware-aware NAS methods.

Method: Uses subnets mutual distillation with sandwich rule sampling and DKD loss for logits distillation. Trains latency surrogate predictors on three robotic edge hardware types to estimate inference latency during evolutionary search.

Result: RAM-NAS models achieve 76.7%-81.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, significantly reduce inference latency on edge hardware, and show improved performance on downstream detection and segmentation tasks compared to MobileNetv3.

Conclusion: The work successfully fills the gap in robot hardware resource-aware NAS, demonstrating effective multi-objective optimization balancing accuracy and latency for robotic applications.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: JFTO framework enables robots to learn manipulation tasks from human video demonstrations by treating them as object-centric guides rather than directly imitating human hand motions, balancing grasp feasibility, trajectory consistency, and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from human video demonstrations is scalable but challenging due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints between humans and robots.

Method: Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework that extends flow matching to SE(3) for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, integrating grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective.

Result: Validated in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse manipulation tasks, showing effective imitation while avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: The proposed JFTO framework successfully addresses the challenges of video-based Learning-from-Demonstration by providing a probabilistic, object-centric approach that ensures feasibility and safety in robot manipulation.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SLAM pipelines are fragile under rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration.

Method: Hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with object-level cues, combined with semantic-probabilistic topological map for coarse-to-fine planning using LLM-based global reasoning and vision-based local planning.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success across simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to semantics-driven decision making.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MASt3R-Fusion is a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with inertial and GNSS data using Sim(3)-based visual alignment constraints in a hierarchical factor graph for real-time pose tracking and globally consistent mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual SLAM systems struggle with low-texture environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging conditions. While neural network-based pointmap regression shows promise, existing approaches discard the advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion.

Method: The system introduces Sim(3)-based visual alignment constraints into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph. It uses a hierarchical factor graph design that enables both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures.

Result: Evaluation on public benchmarks and self-collected datasets shows substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems.

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion demonstrates that tight integration of feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information enables more accurate and robust visual SLAM performance, with the framework being released open-source for reproducibility.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes TISA module to address spatio-temporal misalignment in autoregressive planning for autonomous driving, using kinematic action prediction and multi-objective DPO training to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models suffer from spatio-temporal misalignment where planners must condition future actions on past sensory data, creating inconsistent worldviews that limit performance.

Method: Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module projects environmental features into consistent ego-centric frames, kinematic action prediction for physical feasibility, and multi-objective DPO for fine-grained behavior learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses worldview inconsistency in autonomous driving planning while ensuring physical feasibility and providing targeted behavior feedback.

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

*Sibo Li,Qianyue Hao,Yu Shang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KeyWorld is a framework that accelerates text-conditioned robotic world models by focusing transformer computation on semantic key frames and using lightweight interpolation for intermediate frames, achieving 5.68× speedup while improving physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic world models suffer from slow inference speed due to frame-to-frame generation redundancy and lack physical plausibility by neglecting important semantic transitions in motion trajectories.

Method: KeyWorld identifies significant motion transitions to obtain key frames, trains a DiT model to generate these key frames from text descriptions, and uses a lightweight interpolator to fill intermediate frames efficiently.

Result: On the LIBERO benchmark, KeyWorld achieves 5.68× acceleration compared to frame-to-frame baselines and generates more physically valid videos, especially on complex tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical path toward deploying efficient and effective world models in real-time robotic control and other domains requiring both speed and physical validity.

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

*William Barron,Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CrossInstruct framework enables robots to learn behaviors from cross-modal instructions (text labels and annotations) instead of physical demonstrations, using VLMs to synthesize motion trajectories that generalize beyond training examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot teaching requires cumbersome motion demonstrations via teleoperation or physical guidance, which is difficult to scale. This paper aims to create a more scalable alternative using rough annotations and text labels.

Method: CrossInstruct integrates cross-modal instructions into VLM context, iteratively queries a fine-tuned model to synthesize motion over 2D views, then fuses into 3D motion trajectories. Combines large VLM reasoning with fine-grained pointing model.

Result: The framework produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond training examples, provides strong initialization for reinforcement learning policies, and works effectively without additional fine-tuning in simulation and real hardware.

Conclusion: CrossInstruct offers a scalable paradigm for robot behavior learning that bypasses the need for physical demonstrations, enabling efficient policy learning through cross-modal instructions and VLM-based motion synthesis.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReasonNav is a modular robot navigation system that uses vision-language models to enable human-like navigation behaviors like reading signs and asking for directions, making navigation more efficient in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot navigation systems lack human-like behaviors such as reading signs and asking for directions, making them inefficient in large man-made environments like office buildings.

Method: Uses a vision-language model with compact input/output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning rather than low-level navigation details.

Result: The system successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings, as demonstrated in real and simulated navigation tasks.

Conclusion: ReasonNav demonstrates that integrating human-like navigation skills through vision-language models can significantly improve robot navigation efficiency in complex environments.

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

### [206] [Every Character Counts: From Vulnerability to Defense in Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20589)
*Maria Chiper,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates character-level deep learning models (CharCNN, CharGRU, CharBiLSTM) for phishing email detection, focusing on robustness, interpretability, and performance under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phishing detection methods lack explainability and robustness against new attacks, prompting the need for character-level models that can provide both interpretability and better detection capabilities.

Method: Evaluated three character-level neural architectures on a custom email dataset under three scenarios: standard training/testing, adversarial attack testing, and adversarial training. Used Grad-CAM for interpretability and tested models under limited computational resources.

Result: CharGRU performed best across all scenarios under computational constraints. All models showed vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training significantly improved robustness. Grad-CAM successfully visualized influential email parts for model decisions.

Conclusion: Character-level models, particularly CharGRU, offer effective phishing detection with interpretability. Adversarial training enhances robustness, and the approach is suitable for real-world deployment as browser extensions with limited resources.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

### [207] [PMark: Towards Robust and Distortion-free Semantic-level Watermarking with Channel Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21057)
*Jiahao Huo,Shuliang Liu,Bin Wang,Junyan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Aiwei Liu,Xuming Hu,Mingxun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PMark introduces a new semantic-level watermarking framework using proxy functions to achieve distortion-free watermarking with strong theoretical guarantees against paraphrasing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic-level watermarking methods lack strong theoretical robustness guarantees and introduce distribution distortions through reject-sampling-based generation.

Method: PMark uses proxy functions to map sentences to scalar values, dynamically estimates PF median for next sentence through sampling, and enforces multiple PF constraints (channels) to strengthen watermark evidence.

Result: PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM baselines in both text quality and robustness, achieving distortion-free property and improved robustness against paraphrasing attacks.

Conclusion: PMark provides a more effective paradigm for detecting machine-generated text with solid theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at
[this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).

### [208] [BlockFUL: Enabling Unlearning in Blockchained Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16294)
*Xiao Liu,Mingyuan Li,Xu Wang,Guangsheng Yu,Wei Ni,Lixiang Li,Haipeng Peng,Renping Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BlockFUL is a dual-chain blockchain framework for federated learning unlearning that introduces parallel and sequential paradigms using gradient-ascent and re-training methods to efficiently remove data dependencies across inherited models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning with blockchain creates complex inheritance relationships where unlearning requires editing multiple interlinked blockchain records and updating all inherited models, making the process challenging.

Method: Proposes BlockFUL with dual-chain structure (live chain + archive chain) and two unlearning paradigms (parallel and sequential) implemented through gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based methods to reduce computational costs.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 show effective reduction of data dependency and operational overhead, boosting unlearning performance.

Conclusion: BlockFUL successfully enables efficient unlearning capabilities in blockchained federated learning through its dual-chain architecture and novel unlearning paradigms.

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.
