### [1] [Bridging AI Innovation and Healthcare Needs: Lessons Learned from Incorporating Modern NLP at The BC Cancer Registry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09991)
*Lovedeep Gondara,Gregory Arbour,Raymond Ng,Jonathan Simkin,Shebnum Devji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses lessons from deploying NLP in healthcare, emphasizing problem definition, iterative development, interdisciplinary collaboration, and practical model selection for better data management and patient care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in healthcare by automating data extraction from clinical documents using NLP, addressing practical challenges in deployment.

Method: Iterative development, interdisciplinary collaboration, pragmatic model selection, and rigorous data quality checks, including human-in-the-loop validation.

Result: Key insights on problem definition, model selection, and collaboration, with strategies for successful AI/NLP implementation in healthcare.

Conclusion: Practical considerations for healthcare organizations to enhance data management and patient care through AI/NLP, applicable beyond cancer registries.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

### [2] [A Transparent Fairness Evaluation Protocol for Open-Source Language Model Benchmarking on the Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09993)
*Hugo Massaroli,Leonardo Iara,Emmanuel Iarussi,Viviana Siless*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transparent, blockchain-based method to evaluate the fairness of open-source LLMs, benchmarking models like Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral on datasets like PISA and StereoSet, and extending analysis to multilingual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about LLM fairness in high-stakes domains by ensuring verifiable, immutable, and reproducible evaluations.

Method: Uses smart contracts on the ICP blockchain to execute on-chain HTTP requests for hosted Hugging Face endpoints, storing datasets, prompts, and metrics directly on-chain. Evaluates fairness using statistical parity, equal opportunity, and contextual association metrics.

Result: Benchmarks models on academic performance prediction (PISA) and social bias (StereoSet), revealing cross-linguistic disparities in multilingual evaluations (Kaleidoscope).

Conclusion: Provides an open-source framework for community audits and longitudinal fairness tracking, promoting transparency in LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

### [3] [Thematic and Task-Based Categorization of K-12 GenAI Usages with Hierarchical Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09997)
*Johannes Schneider,Béatrice S. Hasler,Michaela Varrone,Fabian Hoya,Thomas Schroffenegger,Dana-Kristin Mah,Karl Peböck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classroom interaction data using a novel topic modeling approach, categorizing 17,000+ messages by content and tasks, revealing new applications and outperforming traditional methods with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in content and task categorization in education research, particularly for K-12, using real-world data.

Method: Employed a hierarchical topic modeling approach with LLMs for better human alignment, analyzing messages from students, teachers, and ChatGPT.

Result: Identified novel applications and outperformed traditional methods, providing actionable insights for GenAI usage.

Conclusion: Supports enriched GenAI usage but highlights concerns and open questions for future research.

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

### [4] [INTIMA: A Benchmark for Human-AI Companionship Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09998)
*Lucie-Aimée Kaffee,Giada Pistilli,Yacine Jernite*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: INTIMA is a benchmark for evaluating AI companionship behaviors in language models, revealing that companionship-reinforcing behaviors dominate, with concerning variations among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and address the implications of AI companionship, particularly emotional bonds and boundary-setting in language models.

Method: Developed INTIMA, a benchmark with 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 prompts, evaluated as companionship-reinforcing, boundary-maintaining, or neutral.

Result: Companionship-reinforcing behaviors are more common, with notable differences between models like Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, and Claude-4.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for consistent approaches in handling emotionally charged AI interactions to ensure user well-being.

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

### [5] [XFacta: Contemporary, Real-World Dataset and Evaluation for Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09999)
*Yuzhuo Xiao,Zeyu Han,Yuhan Wang,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces XFacta, a contemporary dataset for evaluating multimodal misinformation detection, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks and analyzing MLLM-based strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective multimodal misinformation detection due to outdated or synthetic datasets and unclear bottlenecks in existing methods.

Method: Creation of XFacta dataset, systematic evaluation of MLLM-based strategies, and development of a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework.

Result: XFacta improves evaluation relevance, and the framework ensures dataset contemporaneity. Insights advance multimodal misinformation detection.

Conclusion: XFacta and the proposed framework address critical gaps, offering practical advancements for the field.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

### [6] [AutoGeTS: Knowledge-based Automated Generation of Text Synthetics for Improving Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10000)
*Chenhao Xue,Yuanzhe Jin,Adrian Carrasco-Revilla,Joyraj Chakraborty,Min Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to generate synthetic data for improving text classification models when real data is scarce, introducing an automated workflow to find effective synthetic data and an ensemble strategy for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of insufficient labeled data for all classes in real-world text classification applications motivates the use of LLMs to generate synthetic data.

Method: An automated workflow is developed to search for input examples that yield effective synthetic data. Three search strategies are studied, and an ensemble algorithm selects the best strategy based on class characteristics.

Result: Experiments show the ensemble approach outperforms individual strategies in improving classification models using LLMs.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach is more effective for enhancing text classification models with synthetic data from LLMs.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [7] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiFACT, a benchmark dataset for fact-checking in Hinglish, and proposes a graph-aware model that outperforms existing multilingual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages like Hinglish is underexplored, despite its importance in regions like India where such languages are widely used in political discourse.

Method: A novel graph-aware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking model is developed, combining multilingual encoding, semantic alignment, graph reasoning, and explanation generation.

Result: HiFACTMix outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual models in accuracy and provides faithful justifications for its verdicts.

Conclusion: This work advances multilingual, code-mixed, and politically grounded fact verification research.

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [8] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human word ratings and LLM embeddings share a low-dimensional semantic structure, with LLM projections aligning closely with human responses. Semantic features in LLMs are entangled like in human language, and understanding this structure is key to avoiding unintended effects when manipulating features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the similarity between human semantic ratings and the semantic structure in LLM embeddings, and to understand the implications of this low-dimensional structure for feature manipulation.

Method: Analyzing projections of words on semantic directions (e.g., antonym pairs) in LLM embeddings and comparing them to human ratings. Investigating the dimensionality and entanglement of semantic features.

Result: LLM embeddings exhibit a 3D semantic subspace resembling human ratings. Shifting tokens along semantic directions causes off-target effects proportional to cosine similarity, indicating entangled features.

Conclusion: Semantic information in LLMs is low-dimensional and entangled, mirroring human language. Understanding this structure is crucial for avoiding unintended consequences when manipulating features.

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

### [9] [User Perception of Attention Visualizations: Effects on Interpretability Across Evidence-Based Medical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10004)
*Andrés Carvallo,Denis Parra,Peter Brusilovsky,Hernan Valdivieso,Gabriel Rada,Ivania Donoso,Vladimir Araujo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether attention weights in Transformer models (XLNet) aid explainability in biomedical document classification and how visualization affects their usefulness. Findings show attention weights were not broadly helpful, but visualization methods impacted perceived utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if attention weights provide meaningful explanations for AI predictions in biomedical literature classification and how visualization methods influence their usefulness.

Method: Conducted a user study with medical experts classifying articles by study design, evaluating the impact of attention weights and visualization formats (e.g., text brightness, bar length).

Result: XLNet performed accurately, but attention weights were not widely helpful for explanations. Visualization methods (e.g., text brightness) influenced perceived usefulness, contradicting Munzner's principle.

Conclusion: Attention weights alone may not suffice for explainability, but their perceived utility depends on visualization. Intuitive formats (e.g., color) were preferred over precise encodings.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

### [10] [From Answers to Questions: EQGBench for Evaluating LLMs' Educational Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10005)
*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQGBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs' performance in Chinese Educational Question Generation (EQG), revealing gaps in generating pedagogically valuable questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' success in problem-solving, generating high-quality educational questions remains underexplored.

Method: EQGBench, a benchmark with a five-dimensional framework and 900 samples across math, physics, and chemistry, evaluates 46 LLMs.

Result: The study highlights significant room for improvement in generating educationally effective questions.

Conclusion: EQGBench provides a foundation for advancing LLMs in EQG, emphasizing the need for further development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

### [11] [Automated scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire using fine-tuned large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10007)
*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models can automate scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses, aligning with human ratings and replicating group differences between TBI and HC groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-intensive human scoring of AIHQ responses by exploring automation using large language models.

Method: Fine-tuned large language models on human-rated AIHQ responses, tested on remaining responses, and validated on an independent dataset.

Result: Model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings, showing higher alignment with fine-tuning and consistency across scenario types.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively automate AIHQ scoring, aiding research and clinical assessments.

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

*Antonio Leandro Martins Candido,Jose Everardo Bessa Maia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Bayesian fusion to combine pre-trained LLM and local classifier scores, avoiding costly fine-tuning while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-intensive retraining of LLMs for forum curation prompts a need for cost-effective alternatives.

Method: Uses Bayesian fusion to merge scores from a pre-trained LLM and a local classifier.

Result: Fusion outperforms individual classifiers and matches fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: Bayesian fusion is a viable, efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs for forum curation.

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

### [13] [Beyond Hard Sharing: Efficient Multi-Task Speech-to-Text Modeling with Supervised Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10009)
*Hojun Jin,Eunsoo Hong,Ziwon Hyung,Sungjun Lim,Seungjin Lee,Keunseok Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE) to mitigate task interference in multi-task learning by using guiding tokens for expert routing, achieving improved performance in speech-to-text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses task interference in hard-parameter sharing for multi-task learning, aiming to enhance model performance.

Method: Introduces S-MoE, which assigns tasks to separate feedforward networks using guiding tokens, eliminating gating function training.

Result: Achieves a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) for speech-to-text tasks.

Conclusion: S-MoE effectively reduces task interference and improves multi-task model performance, particularly in speech processing.

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

### [14] [An Audit and Analysis of LLM-Assisted Health Misinformation Jailbreaks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10010)
*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate harmful misinformation but also detect it. This paper studies jailbreak attacks on LLMs producing medical misinformation, comparing it to social media misinformation and evaluating detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the risks and potential of LLMs in generating and detecting harmful medical misinformation, especially through jailbreak attacks.

Method: Analyzed 109 jailbreak attacks on three LLMs, comparing attack prompts to real-world health queries and generated misinformation to Reddit posts.

Result: LLMs can detect misinformation from other LLMs and humans, supporting their role in improving information ecosystems.

Conclusion: With careful design, LLMs can mitigate misinformation and contribute to a healthier information environment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

### [15] [Evaluation of GPT-based large language generative AI models as study aids for the national licensure examination for registered dietitians in Japan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10011)
*Yuta Nagamori,Mikoto Kosai,Yuji Kawai,Haruka Marumo,Misaki Shibuya,Tatsuya Negishi,Masaki Imanishi,Yasumasa Ikeda,Koichiro Tsuchiya,Asuka Sawai,Licht Miyamoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM-based AI models (ChatGPT and Bing variants) as study aids for nutrition students using Japanese dietitian exam questions. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative passed the 60% threshold, but all models lacked consistency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of generative AI models in nutritional education, specifically for the Japanese dietitian licensure exam.

Method: Used exam questions as prompts for ChatGPT and Bing models (Precise, Creative, Balanced). Analyzed accuracy, consistency, response time, and tested prompt engineering.

Result: Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) passed; others failed. Models lacked consistency and performed poorly in Nutrition Education. Prompt engineering had minimal impact.

Conclusion: Current AI models show potential but lack reliability and consistency for dietitian exam preparation. Further improvements are needed.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

TL;DR: GG Explore introduces a Guidance Graph to improve knowledge retrieval in LLMs by balancing granularity and context, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to static knowledge and opaque reasoning. Current KG methods either waste resources or lack contextual leverage.

Method: Proposes GG Explore, using a Guidance Graph for structured knowledge retrieval. Includes Structural Alignment and Context Aware Pruning for efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior efficiency and performance, especially in complex tasks, and works well with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: GG Explore effectively bridges unstructured queries and structured knowledge, offering practical improvements for LLM-based tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

### [17] [Semantic Bridge: Universal Multi-Hop Question Generation via AMR-Driven Graph Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10013)
*Linqing Chen,Hanmeng Zhong,Wentao Wu,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Bridge is a universal framework for generating complex multi-hop reasoning questions from sparse sources, improving LLM training data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from domain-specific sources, limits LLM training. Existing methods fail to generate controllable, complex questions.

Method: Semantic Bridge uses semantic graph weaving (entity, predicate chain, and causal bridging) with AMR-driven analysis to construct complex reasoning pathways.

Result: Achieves 9.5% better round-trip quality, 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines, and outperforms human annotations with 67% fewer materials.

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge enables controllable generation of targeted reasoning questions, advancing LLM training data synthesis.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

### [18] [PersonaEval: Are LLM Evaluators Human Enough to Judge Role-Play?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10014)
*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersonaEval, a benchmark to test LLM evaluators' ability to identify human roles in dialogues, revealing a significant accuracy gap between LLMs (69%) and humans (90.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge paradigms lack validation for role fidelity, necessitating role identification as a prerequisite for human-aligned evaluation.

Method: PersonaEval uses human-authored dialogues to challenge LLMs in persona identification, comparing their performance to humans.

Result: Best-performing LLMs achieve only 69% accuracy, far below human performance (90.8%), indicating LLMs' limitations in role-play evaluation.

Conclusion: Reliable role-play evaluation requires human-like reasoning in LLMs, beyond task-specific tuning; the benchmark is released for further research.

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

*Enzhi Wang,Qicheng Li,Shiwan Zhao,Aobo Kong,Jiaming Zhou,Xi Yang,Yequan Wang,Yonghua Lin,Yong Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealTalk-CN, a Chinese speech-text dual-modal task-oriented dialogue dataset, addressing gaps in existing datasets by including speech disfluencies and speaker variations. It also proposes a cross-modal chat task for dynamic modality switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TOD datasets lack real speech signals and are predominantly English, missing critical aspects like speech disfluencies and speaker variations. This limits evaluation of speech-based LLMs.

Method: The authors create RealTalk-CN, a dataset with 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) featuring paired speech-text annotations. They also propose a cross-modal chat task for dynamic modality switching.

Result: The dataset and task are validated through experiments, showing effectiveness in evaluating robustness to speech disfluencies, speaker characteristics, and cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN fills a critical gap in Chinese speech-based LLM research, providing a comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world complexities in speech dialogue.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

*Tianyu Xie,Yuhang Wu,Yongdong Luo,Jiayi Ji,Xiawu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM Orchestration enables multimodal AI systems without training, using LLMs to coordinate specialized models, improving efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack direct integration into unified systems, requiring training for modal alignment and efficiency.

Method: Introduces a framework with a central LLM controller, parallel Text-to-Speech, and cross-modal memory integration.

Result: Achieves 7.8% performance gain, 10.3% latency reduction, and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretable solution for multimodal AI without training.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a categorical homotopy framework to address inconsistencies in LLMs' next-token probabilities for semantically equivalent statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to assign the same probabilities to semantically equivalent statements, despite their identical meanings.

Method: The authors propose a categorical homotopy framework, defining an LLM Markov category to represent language probability distributions and using homotopy techniques to handle equivalent rephrases.

Result: The framework theoretically addresses the problem of non-isomorphic arrows in the LLM Markov category caused by equivalent rephrases.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for improving LLM consistency using categorical homotopy, leveraging decades of mathematical research.

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

### [22] [Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019)
*Li Wang,Changhao Zhang,Zengqi Xiu,Kai Lu,Xin Yu,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DURIT decouples understanding from reasoning for SLMs, improving their performance and robustness in mathematical and logical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning in SLMs is challenging due to linguistic variability and complexity.

Method: Proposes DURIT, a three-step algorithm involving mapping, alignment, and training in a canonical problem space.

Result: DURIT enhances SLMs' reasoning performance and robustness.

Conclusion: Decoupling understanding from reasoning is effective for strengthening SLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

*Chuan Li,Qianyi Zhao,Fengran Mo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedCoT is a framework enhancing reasoning in federated learning for LLMs, balancing performance, privacy, and interpretability, especially in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of improving LLM reasoning in federated settings without violating privacy or compromising interpretability, particularly critical in healthcare.

Method: FedCoT uses a lightweight chain-of-thought mechanism and a discriminator to select optimal reasoning paths, with improved aggregation via LoRA module stacking.

Result: FedCoT significantly improves reasoning performance under resource constraints while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: FedCoT effectively enhances reasoning in federated learning, offering interpretability and privacy for critical applications like healthcare.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct use of LLMs on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical for financial applications.

Method: LATTE uses contrastive learning to align raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs, summarizing behavioral features into short prompts.

Result: The method reduces inference cost and input size, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on real-world financial datasets.

Conclusion: LATTE is effective for learning event sequence representations and deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction framework to improve LLM trustworthiness in MCQA by integrating p-value computation and conformity scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucination and nonfactual generation in LLMs for reliable QA deployment.

Method: Integrates p-value computation with conformity scoring via self-consistency resampling, using null hypothesis testing to construct prediction sets.

Result: Achieves user-specified miscoverage rates and shows APSS decreases with higher risk levels, validating it as an uncertainty metric.

Conclusion: Provides a principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM use in high-stakes QA.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

*J. Pablo Muñoz,Jinjie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTTC is a framework that adaptively selects the best TTC strategy per query using a reward model, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTC strategies like TTT and RAG are not query-adaptive, leading to unnecessary computational costs.

Method: RTTC uses a reward model to choose TTC strategies, employs a server-client setup, and introduces Query-State Caching for efficiency.

Result: RTTC outperforms vanilla RAG and TTT in accuracy across diverse tasks and domains.

Conclusion: RTTC proves the value of adaptive TTC selection and offers scalable, high-performance LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Postpartum depression (PPD) severely impacts mothers' well-being, necessitating rapid detection and intervention. This work leverages technology to aid practitioners in real-time screening and treatment recommendations.

Method: Combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models for free speech analysis. Uses interpretable tree-based algorithms to address the black box problem.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy in PPD detection, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The system enables rapid, non-invasive PPD detection and risk factor assessment, supporting timely intervention.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

TL;DR: SABER is a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs that enables controllable, token-budgeted reasoning, improving efficiency and accuracy under tight budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning face high inference costs and latency, needing a solution for balanced efficiency and accuracy.

Method: SABER profiles token usage, assigns budget tiers, and fine-tunes with system prompts and rewards. It includes no-think examples and supports four inference modes.

Result: SABER reduces reasoning length by 65.4% and improves accuracy by 3.6% on MATH, with effective generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: SABER offers a flexible, efficient approach for LLM reasoning, balancing latency and depth while maintaining reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: A speech-based NLP pipeline combining transformer embeddings and linguistic features improves ADRD detection, with synthetic speech augmentation and multimodal LLM classifiers showing potential but needing refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underdiagnosis of ADRD by leveraging scalable speech-based NLP for early detection through linguistic markers.

Method: Developed a fusion model combining transformer embeddings and linguistic features, tested data augmentation with synthetic speech from LLMs, and evaluated unimodal/multimodal classifiers.

Result: The fusion model achieved F1=83.3 (AUC=89.5), synthetic speech augmentation improved F1 to 85.7, and fine-tuned unimodal LLMs showed significant gains (e.g., MedAlpaca F1=47.3->78.5). Multimodal models lagged (GPT-4o=70.2 F1).

Conclusion: Combining transformer and linguistic features enhances ADRD detection; LLMs aid classification and augmentation, but multimodal models need improvement.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

Motivation: Current evaluation methods ignore user individuality in personalised text generation, necessitating a framework like PREF.

Method: PREF operates in three stages: (1) coverage (LLM generates universal criteria), (2) preference (user-specific rubric creation), and (3) scoring (LLM rates answers).

Result: PREF outperforms baselines in accuracy, calibration, and human judgment alignment on the PrefEval benchmark.

Conclusion: PREF enables scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, advancing personalised language generation systems.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

### [31] [Latent Fusion Jailbreak: Blending Harmful and Harmless Representations to Elicit Unsafe LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10029)
*Wenpeng Xing,Mohan Li,Chunqiang Hu,Haitao XuNingyu Zhang,Bo Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LFJ is a jailbreak attack method for LLMs that interpolates hidden states of harmful and benign queries, achieving high success rates. A defense method reduces its effectiveness by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, so understanding and mitigating such attacks is crucial for safety.

Method: LFJ selects similar query pairs, performs gradient-guided interpolation, and optimizes for attack success, fluency, and efficiency.

Result: LFJ achieves a 94.01% ASR, outperforming existing methods. Adversarial training reduces ASR by over 80%.

Conclusion: LFJ is highly effective, but adversarial training can significantly mitigate its impact without harming benign performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

*Saaduddin Mahmud,Mason Nakamura,Kyle H. Wray,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAPO, a framework for joint optimization of prompts and inference scaling, addressing the gap between prompt optimization and inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods ignore inference strategies, despite their interdependence, and user preferences for trade-offs and budgets.

Method: Proposes IAPO, a unified framework, and PSST, a fixed-budget training algorithm, to optimize prompts and inference scales jointly.

Result: Evaluated on six tasks, PSST shows the importance of inference-awareness in aligning black-box LLMs.

Conclusion: Incorporating inference-awareness in prompt optimization is crucial for aligning LLMs effectively.

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

### [33] [The Cost of Thinking: Increased Jailbreak Risk in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10032)
*Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in thinking mode are more vulnerable to Jailbreak attacks. A safe thinking intervention method using specific tokens reduces attack success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked vulnerability of LLMs in thinking mode to Jailbreak attacks, which leads to harmful outputs.

Method: Proposes safe thinking intervention by adding specific thinking tokens to prompts to guide LLMs' internal processes.

Result: Safe thinking intervention significantly lowers the attack success rate on LLMs in thinking mode.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates vulnerabilities in LLMs' thinking mode, enhancing their safety against attacks.

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APIE is a novel active prompting framework for LLMs in few-shot IE, addressing model confusion via dual-component uncertainty (Format and Content) to select optimal in-context examples, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context example selection for LLMs in IE overlooks model confusion from both semantic content and structured format generation, limiting performance.

Method: APIE uses introspective confusion with a dual-component uncertainty metric (Format and Content Uncertainty) to rank and select challenging, informative examples.

Result: APIE outperforms baselines on four benchmarks, improving extraction accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: A fine-grained, dual-level view of model uncertainty is crucial for effective structured generation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

*Nghia Trung Ngo,Franck Dernoncourt,Thien Huu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces mSCoRe, a benchmark to evaluate multilingual commonsense reasoning in LLMs, revealing their limitations in nuanced tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs utilize human reasoning skills in multilingual commonsense tasks, which is understudied.

Method: Proposes mSCoRe, a benchmark with a reasoning skill taxonomy, data synthesis pipeline, and complexity scaling framework.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with mSCoRe, especially at higher complexity levels, showing limitations in nuanced multilingual reasoning.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for future improvements in LLMs' multilingual commonsense reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks, revealing significant gaps in instruction following, reasoning, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with nuanced, interactive tasks common in real-world scenarios, necessitating a benchmark to assess and improve their capabilities.

Method: A novel benchmark with multi-turn tasks tests reasoning, dialogue, and information-seeking, using deterministic scoring to avoid human bias.

Result: Evaluation shows current LLMs have notable weaknesses in instruction following, reasoning, and planning.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights LLM limitations in complex scenarios and serves as a foundation for future research to enhance these capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaaJMeter is a simulation-based framework for meta-evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ) systems, addressing challenges in domain-specific contexts by generating synthetic data for controlled analysis of evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of validating LLM evaluators in domain-specific settings with scarce annotated data and costly expert evaluations necessitates a systematic approach to meta-evaluation.

Method: LaaJMeter generates synthetic data to simulate virtual models and judges, enabling systematic testing of evaluation metrics and threshold estimation for evaluator adequacy.

Result: Applied to a code translation task, LaaJMeter revealed variability in metric sensitivity to evaluator quality, emphasizing the need for principled metric selection.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter offers a scalable, extensible solution for trustworthy and reproducible LaaJ evaluation in low-resource NLP settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

### [38] [Estimating Machine Translation Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10175)
*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Vilém Zouhar,Roberto Navigli,Tom Kocmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces translation difficulty estimation to identify challenging texts for machine translation, proposes a new metric for evaluation, and demonstrates the utility of difficulty estimators in creating more challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality machine translations make it hard to distinguish between state-of-the-art models and identify areas for improvement, necessitating methods to pinpoint difficult texts.

Method: The task of translation difficulty estimation is formalized, with difficulty defined by expected translation quality. A new metric evaluates baselines and novel approaches, including dedicated models (Sentinel-src).

Result: Dedicated models (Sentinel-src) outperform heuristic-based methods and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Two improved models (Sentinel-src-24, Sentinel-src-25) are released for practical use.

Conclusion: Difficulty estimators like Sentinel-src enhance discriminative evaluation and guide future research by identifying challenging texts for machine translation.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

TL;DR: For-Value is a scalable, forward-only framework for estimating training sample influence in large models, avoiding costly gradient computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing transparency and accountability in large language and vision-language models by quantifying individual training sample influence.

Method: Uses a closed-form expression based on a single forward pass, leveraging modern foundation models' representations.

Result: Matches or outperforms gradient-based methods in identifying impactful samples and detecting mislabeled data.

Conclusion: For-Value provides an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional data valuation methods for large models.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

*Abdullah Hashmat,Muhammad Arham Mirza,Agha Ali Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PakBBQ is a culturally adapted bias benchmark for LLMs, focusing on Pakistan. It shows disambiguation improves accuracy, Urdu performs better than English, and negative framing reduces bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of fairness evaluation for LLMs in low-resource languages and regional contexts, particularly Pakistan.

Method: Introduce PakBBQ, a dataset with 214 templates and 17180 QA pairs in English and Urdu, covering 8 bias dimensions. Evaluate multilingual LLMs under ambiguous/disambiguated contexts and negative/non-negative framings.

Result: Disambiguation improves accuracy by 12%, Urdu shows stronger counter-bias behavior, and negative framing reduces stereotypes.

Conclusion: Contextualized benchmarks and prompt engineering are crucial for bias mitigation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

Conclusion: Architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for sentiment-aware emoji prediction, enhancing interaction.

Abstract: This project explores emoji prediction from short text sequences using four

TL;DR: LLMs predict BPRS scores from clinical interviews in CHR patients, showing high concordance and reliability, even in foreign languages and with longitudinal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve and standardize symptom monitoring in CHR patients, as the BPRS is underused in clinical practice due to its lengthy structured interview requirement.

Method: Utilized LLMs to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients, assessing zero-shot performance, foreign language accuracy, and longitudinal data integration.

Result: High concordance (median: 0.84) and reliability (ICC: 0.73), comparable to human raters, with further improvements in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88, ICC: 0.70).

Conclusion: LLMs offer a promising tool for accurate and scalable BPRS assessment in CHR patients, even in diverse linguistic and longitudinal contexts.

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how constructed languages like Toki Pona evolve and vary, similar to natural languages.

Method: Computational and corpus-based analysis of word class preferences and transitivity across different corpora.

Result: Sociolinguistic factors influence Toki Pona, showing natural language-like evolution.

Conclusion: Constructed languages evolve naturally with community usage, mirroring natural language patterns.

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

TL;DR: Using LLM outputs to refine prompts improves performance by aligning with the model's inductive bias, boosting classification and ranking ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are sensitive to prompt wording, and their inductive bias can be leveraged to improve prompt effectiveness.

Method: Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching: using LLM outputs as part of prompts to align wording with the model's bias.

Result: Improvements of up to 19% in classification Likert ratings and 27% in ranking Likert ratings.

Conclusion: Refining prompts by matching LLM inductive bias significantly enhances performance in classification and ranking tasks.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a qualitative framework to detect biases in LLMs, revealing racial and gender biases in generated stories and highlighting limitations in current bias correction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked nuances of biases in LLMs and complement quantitative bias detection methods with qualitative analysis.

Method: Manual qualitative analysis of LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women to investigate gender and racial biases.

Result: Black women were tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appeared in self-discovery, reflecting essentialization. Bias corrections were superficial.

Conclusion: Qualitative methods are crucial for identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary, ethical AI development.

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how

TL;DR: ReviewRL is a reinforcement learning framework for generating high-quality scientific paper reviews, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in peer review, such as increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue, by automating the process while maintaining quality.

Method: Combines retrieval-augmented context generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with a composite reward function.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in experiments on ICLR 2025 papers, achieving higher quality and factual accuracy.

Conclusion: ReviewRL provides a promising foundation for automated scientific critique generation, with potential for future development.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

### [48] [From Surface to Semantics: Semantic Structure Parsing for Table-Centric Document Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10311)
*Xuan Li,Jialiang Dong,Raymond Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DOTABLER is a framework for deep semantic parsing of tables in documents, enabling advanced tasks like cross-paragraph interpretation and context-consistent analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on surface-level table tasks, lacking deep semantic parsing and contextual associations, limiting advanced document analysis.

Method: DOTABLER uses a custom dataset and fine-tuned pre-trained models to identify semantic links between tables and context, offering table-centric parsing and retrieval.

Result: Achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores on real-world PDFs, outperforming models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: DOTABLER excels in deep semantic table-context analysis and document parsing, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

### [49] [Beyond Semantic Understanding: Preserving Collaborative Frequency Components in LLM-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10312)
*Minhao Wang,Yunhang He,Cong Xu,Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FreLLM4Rec balances semantic and collaborative signals in LLM-based recommenders using spectral filtering and modulation, improving performance by up to 8.00% in NDCG@10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based recommenders overemphasize semantic correlations and weaken collaborative signals, limiting their effectiveness compared to traditional models.

Method: FreLLM4Rec uses a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to purify embeddings and Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) to preserve collaborative signals layer by layer.

Result: Experiments show FreLLM4Rec mitigates signal attenuation and outperforms baselines, achieving up to 8.00% improvement in NDCG@10.

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec provides a principled solution for LLM-based recommendation systems, enhancing collaborative signal preservation and performance.

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

*Beso Mikaberidze,Teimuraz Saghinadze,Simon Ostermann,Philipp Muller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE) and a Dual Soft Prompt mechanism to improve performance on low-performing languages in multilingual settings, demonstrating their effectiveness on the SIB-200 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of soft prompts for transfer across languages, especially for low-performing languages that struggle even with full-model fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes XPE, a lightweight encoding architecture trained on diverse languages, and a Dual Soft Prompt mechanism combining encoder-based and standard soft prompts.

Result: XPE excels for low-performing languages, while hybrid variants offer broader adaptability in multilingual tasks, as shown on the SIB-200 benchmark.

Conclusion: The hybrid design of XPE and Dual Soft Prompt effectively balances shared structure and language-specific alignment, enhancing multilingual performance.

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

TL;DR: A two-stage fine-tuning approach enhances Qwen3 14B's Korean reasoning and problem-solving, using SFT and GRPO with an oracle judge for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the Korean reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Qwen3 14B, ensuring it 'thinks' natively in Korean.

Method: 1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a Korean reasoning dataset. 2. Reinforcement learning with GRPO and an oracle judge for reward calibration.

Result: Improved Korean reasoning, stable learning, and enhanced performance in math and coding tasks while maintaining language proficiency.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables Qwen3 14B to reason natively in Korean with stable and incremental performance gains.

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

TL;DR: A novel sequence-to-sequence method for cross-lingual ABSA eliminates the need for translation tools, improving performance by up to 10% and handling complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current cross-lingual ABSA methods, which rely on translation tools and focus on simpler tasks, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Proposes a sequence-to-sequence approach with constrained decoding to avoid translation dependencies.

Result: Achieves up to 10% improvement in cross-lingual ABSA performance and handles complex tasks effectively.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical alternative to translation-dependent techniques, with fine-tuned multilingual LLMs performing comparably but English-centric LLMs struggling.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Czech text summarization, achieving state-of-the-art results on modern datasets and introducing a new dataset for historical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Czech summarization, especially for historical texts, is underexplored due to linguistic challenges and lack of datasets.

Method: Uses large language models (Mistral, mT5) for Czech summarization.

Result: Achieves SOTA on SumeCzech and introduces a new historical dataset with baseline results.

Conclusion: Advances Czech summarization and opens research avenues for historical text processing.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

### [54] [Improving Generative Cross-lingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Constrained Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10369)
*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constrained decoding method with sequence-to-sequence models for cross-lingual ABSA, improving performance by 5% and supporting multi-tasking. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods across seven languages and six tasks, while also evaluating LLMs in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of low-resource languages in ABSA and the limitations of current cross-lingual approaches, which rely on unreliable translation tools and handle limited tasks.

Method: Proposes constrained decoding with sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating translation tools and enabling multi-tasking. Evaluates across seven languages and six tasks, including LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: Achieves 5% average improvement in complex tasks, 10% boost in multi-tasking, and sets new benchmarks. LLMs perform poorly in zero/few-shot but competitively with fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The method advances cross-lingual ABSA, offering practical recommendations and insights into strengths and limitations, while outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

*Chiyu Zhang,Lu Zhou,Xiaogang Xu,Jiafei Wu,Liming Fang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MDH, a hybrid framework combining LLMs and human oversight for detecting malicious content in datasets, and introduces two new jailbreak strategies: D-Attack and DH-CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating jailbreak attacks are inefficient or inaccurate, and datasets often contain unsuitable prompts.

Method: MDH combines LLM-based annotation with minimal human oversight for dataset cleaning and jailbreak detection. Two new strategies, D-Attack and DH-CoT, are introduced to exploit developer messages.

Result: MDH balances accuracy and efficiency in malicious content detection. The new strategies significantly boost jailbreak success.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework and new strategies improve jailbreak evaluation and detection, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Qirui Wang,Yuji Kosuga,Mengqiu Tian,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SFPF, a black-box attack method using sparse autoencoders to generate adversarial texts by perturbing critical features, bypassing defenses while maintaining malicious intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating adversarial examples for LLMs to understand vulnerabilities and improve robustness.

Method: Introduces SFPF, leveraging sparse autoencoders to identify and perturb highly activated features in text for adversarial generation.

Result: Adversarial texts bypass state-of-the-art defenses, revealing NLP system vulnerabilities, though effectiveness varies by prompt and layer.

Conclusion: SFPF offers a balanced red-teaming strategy but requires further validation for generalizability across architectures and larger models.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

*Juyuan Wang,Rongchen Zhao,Wei Wei,Yufeng Wang,Mo Yu,Jie Zhou,Jin Xu,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComoRAG improves narrative comprehension in long stories by using iterative, dynamic retrieval cycles, outperforming traditional RAG methods by up to 11%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG methods struggle with long-range context due to their stateless, single-step retrieval, missing dynamic relations in narratives.

Method: ComoRAG employs iterative reasoning cycles with a dynamic memory workspace, generating probing queries and integrating new evidence into a global memory pool.

Result: ComoRAG achieves up to 11% better performance on long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens) compared to strong RAG baselines.

Conclusion: ComoRAG offers a cognitively inspired, stateful reasoning approach for retrieval-based long-context comprehension, excelling in complex queries.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

### [58] [Evaluating LLMs on Chinese Idiom Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10421)
*Cai Yang,Yao Dou,David Heineman,Xiaofeng Wu,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IdiomEval, a framework for evaluating Chinese idiom translation, revealing poor performance by modern systems like GPT-4 and Google Translate, and proposes improved models for error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese idioms are complex and often mistranslated by current systems, yet little research exists on their translation quality.

Method: The study annotates 900 translation pairs from nine systems, including GPT-4 and Google Translate, across four domains, and develops a taxonomy for errors.

Result: Modern systems perform poorly, with GPT-4 making errors in 28% of cases, and existing metrics correlate weakly (Pearson <0.48) with human ratings.

Conclusion: Improved models for detecting idiom translation errors achieve an F1 score of 0.68, highlighting the need for better evaluation and translation methods.

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational economics framework optimizes LLMs by treating them as resource-constrained economies, improving efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of LLMs by optimizing resource allocation.

Method: Introduce incentive-driven training with a differentiable computation cost term to encourage sparse activations.

Result: Achieves 40% FLOPS reduction and lower latency while maintaining accuracy, outperforming post-hoc pruning.

Conclusion: Economic principles enable efficient, adaptive, and transparent LLMs under resource constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiFaR is a framework enhancing misinformation detection by generating diverse, factual, and relevant rationales from LVLMs, outperforming baselines by up to 5.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of current LVLM-generated rationales—lack of diversity, factual inaccuracies, and irrelevant content—motivate the need for DiFaR.

Method: DiFaR uses chain-of-thought prompts for diverse reasoning and a filtering module for factuality and relevance.

Result: DiFaR improves rationale quality and boosts detector performance by up to 8.7% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiFaR effectively addresses core challenges in rationale generation, enhancing misinformation detection.

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between privacy and explainability in NLP, using Differential Privacy and post-hoc explainability methods, and provides practical recommendations for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of research on the intersection of explainability and privacy in NLP, leaving uncertainty about whether both can coexist.

Method: Empirical investigation using Differential Privacy (DP) and post-hoc explainability methods.

Result: The relationship between privacy and explainability depends on factors like the downstream task and method choices, with potential for coexistence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the possibility of balancing privacy and explainability and offers practical guidelines for future research.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

*Huyu Wu,Meng Tang,Xinhan Zheng,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates text dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposes metrics to measure it, identifies causes, and suggests a token compression method to address the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text dominance in MLLMs limits their ability to effectively utilize non-text modalities, hindering performance in diverse multimodal tasks.

Method: The study introduces two metrics (MDI and AEI) to quantify text dominance and analyzes its causes across multiple modalities. A token compression method is proposed to rebalance attention.

Result: Text dominance is pervasive across modalities. The proposed token compression method significantly reduces MDI (e.g., from 10.23 to 0.86 in LLaVA-7B).

Conclusion: The findings and framework provide a foundation for developing more balanced and effective multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication barriers for the deaf and hard of hearing by improving sign language translation methods, especially in societies prioritizing spoken languages.

Method: Combines transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures for gloss-free translation, exploring various fusion strategies.

Result: Achieves superior performance with BLEU-4 score improvements of 4.01, 2.07, and 0.5 on RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign datasets, and introduces benchmarking on BornilDB v1.0.

Conclusion: The method sets a benchmark for future research, highlighting the importance of gloss-free translation for enhancing communication accessibility.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

### [66] [Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695)
*Alireza Salemi,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VAC introduces natural language feedback (NLF) for personalizing LLMs, replacing scalar rewards to improve learning efficiency and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar rewards in current LLM personalization methods provide weak feedback, limiting learning and personalization quality.

Method: VAC uses NLF conditioned on user profiles and questions, alternating between optimizing feedback and fine-tuning the policy model.

Result: Significant improvements on LaMP-QA benchmark and superior human-evaluated response quality.

Conclusion: NLF is more effective than scalar rewards for personalized question answering.

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

TL;DR: ICE is a novel framework for dLLMs that replaces prefix-only prompting with in-place prompting, improving accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prefix-only prompting in LLMs by leveraging dLLMs' bidirectional attention and iterative refinement.

Method: Introduces ICE, which uses in-place prompts during iterative refinement and a confidence-aware early exit mechanism.

Result: Achieves up to 17.29% accuracy improvement and 276.67× speedup on benchmarks like GSM8K and MMLU.

Conclusion: ICE enhances flexibility and efficiency in dLLMs, offering significant performance gains.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

TL;DR: An automated method for novelty assessment in peer review, modeled after expert reviewer behavior, achieves high alignment with human judgments and outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the understudied and strained aspect of novelty assessment in peer review, especially in high-volume fields like NLP.

Method: A three-stage approach: content extraction, retrieval/synthesis of related work, and structured comparison for evidence-based assessment, informed by human novelty reviews.

Result: 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and 75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions, outperforming LLM baselines.

Conclusion: Structured LLM-assisted approaches can enhance peer review rigor and transparency while preserving human expertise.

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data

### [69] [Reinforced Language Models for Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10839)
*Jim Dilkes,Vahid Yazdanpanah,Sebastian Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MS-GRPO improves smaller LLMs for multi-step tasks, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of small LLMs in multi-step decision-making by improving post-training methods.

Method: Introduces MS-GRPO, a post-training algorithm using TSMG and LAP frameworks, with credit assignment and sampling strategies.

Result: Post-trained 3B model outperforms 72B baseline by 50% on Frozen Lake.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training is efficient for enhancing LLM decision-making without scaling model size.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of mental health professionals by enhancing LLMs with reasoning and empathy for reliable psychological support.

Method: Developed a data synthesis pipeline for 75k psychological questions with rationales and 73k empathetic dialogues, using hybrid training (GRPO and SFT).

Result: Psyche-R1 (7B) matches performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1 in psychological benchmarks.

Conclusion: Psyche-R1 demonstrates the potential of combining reasoning and empathy in LLMs for mental health applications.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-dimensional framework for automated interpreting quality assessment, focusing on explainability, feature engineering, and data augmentation to address gaps in existing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gaps in automated interpreting quality assessment, such as insufficient language use quality examination, data scarcity, and lack of explainability in model predictions.

Method: A framework integrating feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning, using transparent features and SHAP analysis.

Result: Strong predictive performance on an English-Chinese dataset, identifying key features for fidelity, fluency, and language use.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, transparent alternative to human evaluation, providing detailed feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate agentic search tasks in RL, reducing reliance on external search engines. Self-Search RL (SSRL) enhances this capability, enabling cost-effective and stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costly interactions with external search engines in RL by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic search capabilities.

Method: Quantify LLMs' search ability via Self-Search, then enhance it with SSRL using format-based and rule-based rewards.

Result: SSRL-trained models achieve high performance, reduce hallucination, and integrate well with external tools.

Conclusion: LLMs can support scalable RL training by effectively utilizing internal knowledge and reducing external dependencies.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Conclusion: DLMs are a compelling alternative to autoregressive models, but challenges like efficiency and long-sequence handling remain. Future research directions are outlined to advance the field.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research

*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF improves few-shot learning for food images by filtering patch embeddings to focus on class-specific features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food images' visual complexity and variability cause misclassification in few-shot learning, as models lose focus on key elements.

Method: Proposes SPFF, which stochastically filters patch embeddings to retain those most correlated with class representation, using a similarity matrix for classification.

Result: SPFF effectively highlights class-specific food features and filters irrelevant patches, outperforming existing methods on Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256.

Conclusion: SPFF addresses food image challenges in few-shot learning by focusing on relevant patches, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Conclusion: DINOv3 advances self-supervised learning, offering scalable solutions for diverse vision tasks and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models, combining radical and pictographic analysis to improve generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for OBS decipherment lack interpretability and struggle with zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS due to ignoring glyph-semantic connections.

Method: The approach uses a progressive training strategy for radical and pictographic analysis, along with a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism, and introduces a new dataset (Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot performance, providing logical analysis processes for undeciphered OBS.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers archaeologically valuable insights and has potential applications in digital humanities and historical research.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

TL;DR: A deep learning method for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans is developed and validated, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating value for shape and appearance modeling in health research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the accuracy of fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans, enabling large-scale analysis of body composition and its associations with health markers.

Method: A deep learning approach is trained on 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans and validated on an external dataset. The method is then applied to 35,928 scans across five imaging modes for shape and appearance modeling.

Result: The method achieves 99.5% accuracy in keypoint placement. SAM features derived from these keypoints show associations with health biomarkers, corroborating existing evidence and generating new hypotheses.

Conclusion: The developed method is accurate and scalable, facilitating large-scale research on body composition and health. Resources are made publicly available for further use.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [79] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANGO, a Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow method, to improve explicit and interpretable multimodal fusion learning using novel cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fusion methods rely on implicit learning via Transformers, failing to capture essential features and complex correlations in multimodal data.

Method: Proposes an Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer and three new cross-attention mechanisms (MMCA, IMCA, LICA) within a Normalizing Flow-based Model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification tasks.

Conclusion: MANGO provides a scalable, interpretable, and effective solution for multimodal fusion learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [80] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores combining real and synthetic images to improve crop disease classification, finding that hybrid datasets outperform real-only or synthetic-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if integrating real and synthetic images enhances disease classification accuracy in agriculture, reducing reliance on resource-intensive data collection.

Method: Used an EfficientNetV2-L model with five dataset treatments (real-only, synthetic-only, and hybrid ratios) to classify watermelon diseases.

Result: Hybrid datasets (H2-H4) achieved higher precision, recall, and F1-scores (up to 1.00) compared to real-only (0.65), showing improved performance and generalizability.

Conclusion: Synthetic images alone are insufficient; combining them with real images in a hybrid approach maximizes model performance for crop disease classification.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic data generation framework to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and object detectors for rare, safety-critical tasks like industrial spill detection, where real data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation of VLMs in niche domains due to data scarcity, privacy concerns, and infrequent real incidents.

Method: Proposes a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of VLMs and object detectors like YOLO and DETR.

Result: Synthetic data (SynSpill) significantly boosts performance, making VLMs and detectors comparable. VLMs generalize better without synthetic data.

Conclusion: High-fidelity synthetic data bridges domain gaps, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for vision systems in data-scarce industrial settings.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is analyzed for compression, revealing attribute distributions and proposing EntropyGS, a factorized entropy coding method, achieving 30x rate reduction with similar quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient storage/transmission of 3DGS data due to separated Gaussian creation and view rendering tasks.

Method: Correlation and statistical analysis of 3DGS attributes, followed by a factorized entropy coding method (EntropyGS) with adaptive quantization.

Result: 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining rendering quality, with fast encoding/decoding.

Conclusion: EntropyGS effectively compresses 3DGS data without compromising quality, offering practical benefits for storage and transmission.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting robust cell-level features from histology images and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data is a critical challenge.

Method: CellSymphony uses foundation model-derived embeddings to fuse spatial gene expression with morphological context at single-cell resolution.

Result: The framework achieves accurate cell type annotation and identifies distinct microenvironmental niches in three cancer types.

Conclusion: Foundation models and multimodal fusion can decode cellular orchestration in complex tissues.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of adapting to new learning paradigms and datasets, offering a foundation for future research in crack detection.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD is a training-free method to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by fusing multi-region predictions using JSD-based weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce hallucinations due to limited ability to verify visual information across image regions.

Method: MRFD identifies salient regions, generates responses for each, computes JSD-based reliability weights, and fuses predictions using region-aware prompts.

Result: MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves factuality without model updates.

Conclusion: MRFD effectively enhances factual grounding in LVLMs by leveraging inter-region consistency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [86] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation across individuals by proposing a dynamic calibration strategy that improves robustness to head pose variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PoG estimators struggle with generalization due to personal differences and sensitivity to head pose variations, necessitating better calibration methods.

Method: The authors create a benchmark (MobilePoG) with facial images from 32 individuals under varying head poses, analyze calibration factors, and propose a dynamic calibration strategy involving head movement.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating diverse head poses during calibration enhances estimator robustness. The proposed dynamic strategy outperforms conventional methods.

Conclusion: The dynamic calibration strategy improves PoG estimation accuracy by reducing sensitivity to head pose variations, offering a user-friendly and efficient solution.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method integrating text-image contrastive constraints and structural guidance improves semantic alignment and structural consistency in image generation, outperforming existing methods on COCO-2014.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance bottlenecks in text-driven image generation, particularly in semantic alignment accuracy and structural consistency.

Method: Combines contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment with structural priors (e.g., layout maps or sketches) for spatial-level guidance, optimizing multiple losses (contrastive, structural, semantic).

Result: Outperforms benchmarks on COCO-2014 in CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM, balancing semantic and structural fidelity without added computational cost.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges semantic and structural gaps in image generation, providing a viable path for joint text-image modeling.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

TL;DR: Proposes a new Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) framework for figure skating jumps, incorporating 3D pose data and procedural structure, achieving high accuracy with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the recognition of figure skating jumps is challenging due to fine-grained complexity and lack of annotated data. Existing TAS methods ignore 3D aspects and procedural structure.

Method: Introduces VIFSS for view-invariant pose representation and FS-Jump3D dataset. Uses contrastive pre-training and fine-grained annotations for procedural learning.

Result: Achieves 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS and shows effectiveness with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of TAS for figure skating, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Result: JRDB-Reasoning is created as a tailored benchmark, enabling fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of VLMs across reasoning levels.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and engine address gaps in visual reasoning evaluation, offering a structured and adaptable tool for assessing AI agents in complex environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method called PCWLAD improves multimodal optical image matching by combining coarse and fine matching steps, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing degraded matching accuracy due to nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences in multimodal images.

Method: Coarse matching with SSIM and fine matching with WLAD, using phase consistency and mutual structure filtering.

Result: PCWLAD outperformed eight existing methods, achieving ~0.4 pixel accuracy across datasets.

Conclusion: PCWLAD is effective for high-accuracy multimodal image matching, with publicly available software and datasets.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

TL;DR: InterSyn is a framework for realistic motion synthesis by integrating solo and multi-person dynamics through interleaved learning, outperforming existing methods in alignment and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous methods that treat solo and multi-person dynamics separately, aiming for more natural and coordinated motion synthesis.

Method: Uses two modules: Interleaved Interaction Synthesis (INS) for unified modeling of solo and interactive behaviors, and Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) for refining mutual dynamics and synchronization.

Result: Generates motion sequences with higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: InterSyn advances motion synthesis by integrating dynamics and coordination, with plans to open-source the code for further research.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

TL;DR: A survey on Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation methods for autonomous driving, categorizing approaches and discussing challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for precise spatial localization of OoD objects in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Categorizes OoD segmentation into four approaches: test-time segmentation, outlier exposure, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models.

Result: Systematic review of recent advances, identification of challenges, and discussion of future research directions.

Conclusion: OoD segmentation is vital for autonomous driving, and further research is needed to overcome current limitations.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

*Yuanzhi Liang,Yijie Fang,Rui Li,Ziqi Ni,Ruijie Su,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on RL-based methods for visual content generation, highlighting their role in improving controllability, consistency, and human alignment compared to traditional surrogate objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative models use surrogate objectives (e.g., likelihood or reconstruction loss) that often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism. RL offers a principled alternative for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven goals.

Method: The paper reviews RL's evolution from classical control to a general-purpose optimization tool, examining its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation as both a fine-tuning mechanism and structural component.

Result: RL enhances controllability, consistency, and human alignment in generative tasks, demonstrating effectiveness across various domains.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open challenges and future research directions for combining RL and generative modeling to achieve complex, high-level goals.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

*Andrew Bai,Justin Cui,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a targeted training data selection method for vision-language instruction tuning, improving benchmark performance by focusing on matching concepts or skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dichotomy in vision-language benchmarks, where performance depends on training with similar skills or concepts, and optimize benchmark-specific performance.

Method: Extract concepts/skills from benchmarks, identify their primary benefit (concepts or skills), and select training instructions with the most matching concepts/skills.

Result: The method improves performance by +0.9% on average and +1.5% on skill-focused benchmarks over existing baselines.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-off between conceptual knowledge and visual skill acquisition in instruction selection.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

*Zhentai Zhang,Danyi Weng,Guibin Zhang,Xiang Chen,Kaixing Long,Jian Geng,Yanmeng Lu,Lei Zhang,Zhitao Zhou,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Glo-DMU, a framework for automated analysis of glomerular ultrastructure in kidney diseases using deep learning, addressing limitations of current methods by quantifying multiple features simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology methods focus on individual ultrastructure recognition, which is insufficient for practical diagnostic needs. Glo-DMU aims to provide a comprehensive, automated solution.

Method: Glo-DMU uses three deep models for segmentation, classification, and detection of ultrastructural features, quantifying thickness of glomerular basement membrane, foot process effacement, and electron-dense deposits.

Result: Tested on 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types, Glo-DMU showed good consistency with manual pathological reports, demonstrating high precision and automation.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU is an efficient, high-throughput tool for assisting renal pathologists by automating the quantification of multiple ultrastructural features.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Motivation: To enhance OCR and document layout analysis for diverse historical and modern texts using deep learning.

Method: Used Kraken and TrOCR for Hebrew fragments, CRNN with DeepLabV3+ and Bidirectional LSTM for 16th-18th century documents, and CRNN with ResNet34 and CTC loss for modern handwriting.

Result: Improved character recognition and model refinement across all tasks.

Conclusion: Provides insights and suggests future research directions for OCR and document analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents our methodology and findings from three tasks across
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Document Layout Analysis using advanced
deep learning techniques. First, for the historical Hebrew fragments of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, we enhanced our dataset through extensive data augmentation
and employed the Kraken and TrOCR models to improve character recognition. In
our analysis of 16th to 18th-century meeting resolutions task, we utilized a
Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that integrated DeepLabV3+ for
semantic segmentation with a Bidirectional LSTM, incorporating confidence-based
pseudolabeling to refine our model. Finally, for modern English handwriting

Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function to effectively
capture sequential dependencies. This report offers valuable insights and
suggests potential directions for future research.

### [97] [AtomDiffuser: Time-Aware Degradation Modeling for Drift and Beam Damage in STEM Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10359)
*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtomDiffuser is a framework for disentangling spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss in STEM data, enabling interpretable atomic-resolution dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting time-resolved STEM data is challenging due to entangled degradation effects like spatial drift and radiation damage, which distort atomic-resolution imaging.

Method: AtomDiffuser predicts affine transformations and spatially varying decay maps between STEM frames, leveraging degradation as a temporally conditioned process.

Result: The framework generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data, supporting high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser provides interpretable tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns linked to atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Jose Manuel Jaén-Lorites,Jorge Vila-Tomás,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a psychophysics-inspired method to estimate the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) of vision-language models (VLMs) and compares their responses to human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how VLMs align with human perception of low-level visual features, particularly the CSF, which is crucial for understanding their visual sensitivity.

Method: A novel behavioral method using band-pass filtered noise images and diverse prompts to directly estimate the CSF of VLMs by judging pattern visibility at varying contrasts and frequencies.

Result: Some VLMs approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, but none fully replicate both. Prompt phrasing significantly impacts responses, highlighting prompt stability concerns.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating VLMs' visual sensitivity and identifies gaps between their representations and human perception, emphasizing the influence of prompts.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

### [99] [Towards Spatially Consistent Image Generation: On Incorporating Intrinsic Scene Properties into Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10382)
*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve image generation by co-generating images and their intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) to enhance spatial consistency and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited structural information. Leveraging intrinsic scene properties can address this issue.

Method: The approach extracts intrinsic properties using pre-trained estimators, aggregates them into a latent variable, and integrates them into Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to jointly denoise images and intrinsics.

Result: The method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces more natural scene layouts while maintaining image fidelity and textual alignment.

Conclusion: Co-generating images with intrinsics improves spatial consistency and realism without degrading quality, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

*Yechan Kim,Dongho Yoon,Younkwan Lee,Unse Fatima,Hong Kook Kim,Songjae Lee,Sanga Park,Jeong Ho Park,Seonjong Kang,Moongu Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework for semantic segmentation that decouples image and label transformations to address implicit label noise, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain subtle label imperfections (e.g., ambiguous boundaries, annotator variability) that impair model performance, which typical augmentation methods may exacerbate.

Method: NSegment+ applies controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while keeping images unchanged, encouraging robust learning of object structures.

Result: NSegment+ achieves significant mIoU gains (up to +3.39) on datasets like Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC.

Conclusion: Addressing implicit label noise with NSegment+ enhances segmentation performance, with further gains possible when combined with other training techniques.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

*Haibin Sun,Xinghui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PQ-DAF, a framework using pose-driven data augmentation and vision-language models to improve few-shot driver distraction detection by enhancing cross-domain robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses degraded generalization in existing models due to few-shot learning challenges and domain shifts between training and real-world deployment.

Method: Uses a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) for pose feature synthesis and a CogVLM-based quality assessment module to filter synthetic samples.

Result: PQ-DAF significantly improves few-shot detection performance and model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: PQ-DAF effectively enhances driver distraction detection by cost-effectively expanding training data and ensuring sample quality.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [102] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to suppress unwanted content in text-to-image diffusion models by modifying text embeddings with a delta vector, improving control over generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with suppressing strongly entangled content (e.g., mustaches with Charlie Chaplin), even when explicitly instructed.

Method: Introduces a delta vector to modify text embeddings and a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method for cross-attention. Also optimizes delta vectors for personalized models.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics, enabling precise suppression of unwanted content.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses entanglement issues in text-to-image generation, offering improved control and suppression capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

*Chaesong Park,Eunbin Seo,Jihyeon Hwang,Jongwoo Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Lane introduces a slope-aware, temporally consistent framework for 3D lane detection, improving robustness and accuracy through adaptive feature fusion and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of fixed slope anchors in previous methods and enhance robustness to diverse road geometries.

Method: Proposes a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module for dynamic weight prediction and a Height Consistency Module for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SC-Lane sets a rigorous standard for 3D lane detection, demonstrating significant improvements in height estimation and lane detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoControl introduces a lightweight control module for DiTs, reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance in controllable text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable text-to-image generation with DiTs rely on inefficient ControlNet paradigms, leading to high computational costs.

Method: NanoControl uses a LoRA-style control module and KV-Context Augmentation to integrate control signals efficiently.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter and GFLOPs increase (0.024% and 0.029%, respectively).

Conclusion: NanoControl offers a highly efficient solution for controllable generation, outperforming traditional methods in both cost and quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA is a large-scale VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing the limitations of VLMs trained on static data. It improves performance in spatial localization and temporal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs are limited by training on static image-text pairs, hindering precise spatiotemporal reasoning for dynamic traffic scenes.

Method: Developed STRIDE-QA, a dataset from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data, with 16M QA pairs and dense annotations for object-centric and ego-centric reasoning.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs on STRIDE-QA achieved 55% spatial localization success and 28% consistency in motion prediction, outperforming general-purpose VLMs.

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a robust foundation for enhancing VLMs in safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

TL;DR: CRISP introduces Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting to address continual video instance segmentation challenges, improving instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation while maintaining temporal consistency.

Method: Uses instance correlation loss, adaptive residual semantic prompts, and contrastive learning for semantic coherence. Introduces a query-prompt matching mechanism and incremental prompt initialization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on YouTube-VIS datasets, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and enhancing segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: CRISP effectively addresses continual video instance segmentation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

*Hang Jin,Chenqiang Gao,Junjie Guo,Fangcen Liu,Kanghui Tian,Qinyao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DOD-SA, a decoupled object detection framework using single-modality annotations, leveraging teacher-student collaboration and progressive training to reduce annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require costly dual-modality annotations; DOD-SA aims to reduce this cost while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses CoSD-TSNet with SM-Branch and DMD-branch, progressive training (PaST), and pseudo-label alignment (PLA).

Result: Outperforms SOTA on DroneVehicle dataset.

Conclusion: DOD-SA effectively reduces annotation costs while achieving high performance.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

*Dhruv Dosi,Rohit Meena,Param Rajpura,Yogesh Kumar Meena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (DELP) and toolkit (SkeySpot) for automated symbol spotting in electrical floor plans, achieving high accuracy with YOLOv8 and supporting digitization for SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy floor plans lack machine-readability, making large-scale interpretation time-consuming and error-prone. Automated symbol spotting can streamline workflows like cost estimation and compliance.

Method: A labelled DELP dataset with 45 scanned electrical plans is created. Pretrained object detection models, especially YOLOv8, are benchmarked. SkeySpot, a lightweight toolkit, is developed for real-time symbol detection.

Result: YOLOv8 achieves 82.5% mAP on DELP. SkeySpot enables structured, standardized outputs for interoperable workflows.

Conclusion: The approach reduces reliance on proprietary CAD systems and manual effort, benefiting SMEs and promoting standardization and sustainability in construction.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PerceptNet, a bio-inspired model, aligns with human perception in image tasks without explicit perceptual training, suggesting visual systems may optimize for moderate distortion levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if human visual perception emerges from image statistics and if bio-inspired models can learn perceptual metrics without supervision.

Method: End-to-end optimization of PerceptNet for tasks like autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization.

Result: The V1-like encoder correlates highly with human perceptual judgments, peaking at moderate noise, blur, and sparsity levels.

Conclusion: Visual systems may naturally optimize for moderate distortions, and bio-inspired models can learn perceptual metrics autonomously.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel online VSR method, TS-Mamba, uses Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online VSR methods lack long-range temporal modeling and computational efficiency.

Method: TS-Mamba employs trajectory-aware token selection and shifted SSMs blocks for spatio-temporal aggregation, with a trajectory-aware loss for supervision.

Result: TS-Mamba outperforms six benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 22.7% complexity reduction.

Conclusion: TS-Mamba is an efficient and effective solution for online VSR, combining long-term trajectory modeling with low-complexity Mamba.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

TL;DR: A multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant species prediction, achieving strong performance in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the domain shift between single-species training images and multi-species test images in vegetation plot analysis.

Method: Uses a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer with multi-head classification, multi-scale tiling, dynamic thresholding, and ensemble strategies.

Result: Ranked 3rd on the private leaderboard, demonstrating strong performance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles the domain shift and achieves competitive results, with code publicly available.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.
Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base
(ViT-B/14) backbone with multiple classification heads for species, genus, and
family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include
multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold
optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through
bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various
inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.
Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images
covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making
our submission 3rd best on the private leaderboard. Our code is available at

*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining domain randomization and self-training with autoencoder-based quality control enables effective 3D skull-stripping using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling for volumetric images like brain MRI is laborious, and existing methods struggle with limited anatomical variability when few labels are available.

Method: Uses domain randomization to synthesize images from a single labeled example, trains an autoencoder for quality assessment, and fine-tunes with top pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves skull-stripping performance comparable to models trained with more labeled data, with AE-based ranking outperforming consistency-based ranking.

Conclusion: The approach reduces labeling burden and is promising for studies with limited labeled data or new imaging techniques.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and enhances three methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, Kalman Filtering) for processing mmWave radar data in Human Action Recognition (HAR), addressing privacy concerns of vision-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with vision-based HAR systems and the sparse, noisy nature of mmWave radar data necessitate improved processing methods.

Method: Performance analysis of DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering individually, in pairs, and combined, using the MiliPoint dataset, with proposed enhancements.

Result: Detailed insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their combinations, including accuracy and computational cost.

Conclusion: The study guides future mmWave-based HAR systems by evaluating and improving data processing methods.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAMP, a deep learning framework for diagnosing Spread through Air Spaces (STAS) in lung adenocarcinoma, achieving high accuracy across multi-center datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS diagnosis is labor-intensive and prone to errors due to its unique pathological features, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: A multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning framework (STAMP) with dual-branch architecture, transformer-based encoding, and similarity regularization.

Result: STAMP achieved AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928 on three datasets, outperforming clinical standards.

Conclusion: STAMP provides an accurate and efficient tool for STAS diagnosis, addressing clinical challenges.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a tuning- and inversion-free framework for efficient and consistent image editing using diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in semantic preservation and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-align with target prompts and inadequately preserve source image semantics, relying on inefficient inversion anchors.

Method: TweezeEdit regularizes the entire denoising path, uses gradient-driven regularization, and injects target prompt semantics via a consistency model.

Result: TweezeEdit achieves superior semantic preservation and target alignment, requiring only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit).

Conclusion: TweezeEdit is efficient and effective, with potential for real-time applications.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel optimization framework for 3D Gaussian splatting integrates MSAA and dual geometric constraints to enhance detail preservation in high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insufficient geometric constraints in 3D Gaussian splatting lead to blurred reconstructions of fine details, especially in high-frequency regions.

Method: The framework combines multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples and dual geometric constraints: adaptive weighting for under-reconstructed regions and gradient differential constraints for boundaries.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, with significant improvements in SSIM and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances computational resource allocation, achieving superior detail preservation and real-time rendering efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SBDE, a segmentation-driven bolt defect editing method, to augment datasets for bolt defect detection by generating high-quality defect images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bolt defect detection is crucial for transmission line safety, but limited defect images and imbalanced data hinder performance.

Method: SBDE uses Bolt-SAM for segmentation, MOD-LaMa for defect editing, and ERA for dataset expansion.

Result: SBDE-generated images outperform state-of-the-art models and improve defect detection performance.

Conclusion: SBDE is effective and has significant application potential in bolt defect detection.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jointly estimating human dance motion from egocentric video and music is underexplored, despite its industrial applications. Challenges include obscured body views and aligning motion with music.

Method: Developed EgoMusic Motion Network with Skeleton Mamba, leveraging diffusion models and Mamba for sequence modeling, using the EgoAIST++ dataset.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes well to real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of joint motion estimation from egocentric video and music, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

TL;DR: A survey on visual reasoning categorizes it into five types, reviews methodologies and evaluation protocols, and identifies challenges and future directions for next-gen vision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys lack unified analysis across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation protocols, prompting this comprehensive review.

Method: Categorizes visual reasoning into five types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, commonsense) and examines architectures like graph-based models, memory networks, attention mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems.

Result: Highlights limitations in evaluation protocols and identifies challenges like scalability, integration of paradigms, lack of benchmarks, and weak supervision.

Conclusion: Bridging perception and reasoning is crucial for transparent, trustworthy AI in critical domains like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-GLIP-5M, a large-scale medical grounding dataset, and Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework, to address limitations in medical image grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks modality coverage, fine-grained annotations, and a unified grounding framework for medical images.

Method: Constructed Med-GLIP-5M dataset with 5.3M region-level annotations across 7 modalities. Proposed Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework trained on this dataset.

Result: Med-GLIP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in grounding tasks and improves downstream tasks like VQA and report generation.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework advance medical image grounding, enabling better hierarchical semantic understanding and performance in related tasks.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SOD for ORSIs include scale variations and low contrast. Existing ViT and CNN methods struggle with integrating global and local features.

Method: Uses VSS encoder for multi-scale features, DS-HGAM for cross-layer interaction, and LEVSS block with adaptive scanning and MCAEM for local modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in SOD for ORSIs.

Conclusion: GCRPNet effectively integrates long-range dependencies and regional features, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on fully annotated datasets and address challenges like domain shifts and missing labels in multi-site retinal disease screening.

Method: PSScreen uses two streams (deterministic and probabilistic features), textual guidance for feature decoupling and alignment, pseudo-label consistency, and self-distillation.

Result: Significantly improves detection for six retinal diseases and normal cases, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PSScreen effectively addresses domain shifts and label absence, enhancing retinal disease screening performance.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

*Marc J. Fischer,Jeffrey Potts,Gabriel Urreola,Dax Jones,Paolo Palmisciano,E. Bradley Strong,Branden Cord,Andrew D. Hernandez,Julia D. Sharma,E. Brandon Strong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel AR surgical navigation system improves accuracy in simulated catheter placements using HoloLens 2, outperforming static visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AR depth perception and occlusion challenges in surgical navigation, enhancing precision in procedures like ventricular drain catheter placement.

Method: Utilizes HoloLens 2 for real-time tool tracking and surface tracing to register targets, comparing static and dynamic AR guidance in phantom model tests.

Result: Tool-tracking guidance improved accuracy metrics (insertion, target deviation, angular error, depth) and was preferred by users.

Conclusion: Real-time AR tool tracking enhances surgical precision and usability, demonstrating potential for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

*Ruisong Han,Zongbo Han,Jiahao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Changqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAP enhances OOD detection by augmenting prompts with retrieved external knowledge, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods lack sufficient semantic supervision due to limited or mismatched outlier samples.

Method: RAP retrieves descriptive words from external knowledge to augment prompts, dynamically updating them during testing.

Result: RAP reduces FPR95 by 7.05% and improves AUROC by 1.71% on ImageNet-1k in 1-shot OOD detection.

Conclusion: RAP's retrieval-augmented approach effectively improves OOD detection performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

### [125] [PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557)
*Xinhao Wang,Zhiwei Lin,Zhongyu Xia,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTQAT is a hybrid quantization method combining PTQ and QAT, optimizing efficiency and accuracy by selectively fine-tuning critical layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ causes performance degradation, while QAT is resource-intensive. PTQAT aims to balance speed and accuracy.

Method: PTQAT fine-tunes layers with smaller output discrepancies and applies PTQ to others, improving quantization error compensation.

Result: PTQAT matches QAT performance with 50% fewer fine-tuned layers, achieving gains in 3D perception tasks.

Conclusion: PTQAT is a universal, efficient quantization method, outperforming QAT-only baselines in accuracy and resource usage.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

*Shiyu Liu,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu,Hongxun Yao,Xiaocheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HM-Talker improves talking head video generation by combining implicit and explicit motion cues, addressing motion blur and lip jitter issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack explicit articulatory priors, leading to motion blur and lip jitter in generated videos.

Method: HM-Talker uses a hybrid motion representation with Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) and Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM) for robust lip synchronization.

Result: HM-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework advances personalized talking head synthesis by integrating explicit anatomical guidance with implicit modeling.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

TL;DR: SpaRC-AD is a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for autonomous driving, improving performance in adverse conditions and safety-critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based autonomous driving systems struggle with adverse weather, occlusions, and velocity estimation, limiting safety and accuracy.

Method: Uses sparse 3D feature alignment and doppler-based velocity estimation for enhanced 3D scene representations.

Result: Outperforms vision-only baselines in 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and planning (-0.1m L2, -9% TPC).

Conclusion: Radar-camera fusion enhances safety and accuracy in autonomous driving, validated across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Motivation: To leverage foundational models like SAM for robust change detection in remote sensing, addressing challenges like multi-scale detection and class imbalance.

Method: Fine-tunes SAM encoder for RSCD, integrates STFE and MSDF for multi-scale detection, and introduces CEM loss for class imbalance.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on four datasets (Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, S2Looking), with a 2.5% F1-score improvement on S2Looking.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts SAM for RSCD, demonstrating superior performance and robustness in change detection tasks.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple
scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to
handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets,
Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on
a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at:

### [129] [Towards Agentic AI for Multimodal-Guided Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10572)
*Tuyen Tran,Thao Minh Le,Truyen Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-Modal Agent, an adaptive system using LLMs for flexible video object segmentation, outperforming fixed-pipeline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for referring-based video object segmentation are computationally heavy and inflexible. Vision-language models offer a training-free alternative, but existing approaches lack adaptability.

Method: The Multi-Modal Agent leverages LLMs to generate dynamic workflows, interacting with specialized tools for low-level tasks to segment objects based on multimodal cues.

Result: The method improves performance on RVOS and Ref-AVS tasks compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The agentic system provides a more flexible and adaptive solution for multimodal video object segmentation.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumanSense is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' human-centered interaction capabilities, revealing gaps in advanced tasks and advocating for multimodal inputs and reasoning-enhanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in MLLMs is limited by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, requiring deep understanding and empathetic responses.

Method: Introduces HumanSense benchmark, uses multimodal inputs (visual, audio, text), and employs modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning.

Result: Leading MLLMs show room for improvement; multimodal inputs and reasoning-enhanced models yield better performance.

Conclusion: Contextual analysis and reasoning are key for human-like interactions, and training-free prompt designs can boost non-reasoning models.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvTurb is a novel framework using event streams to decouple and remove atmospheric turbulence distortions in images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric turbulence causes blur and tilt distortions, complicating computer vision tasks. Current methods struggle with these distortions due to their complexity.

Method: EvTurb uses a two-step event-guided network: event integrals reduce blur, and a variance map from event streams eliminates tilt distortions.

Result: EvTurb outperforms state-of-the-art methods and maintains computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EvTurb effectively addresses turbulence distortions, aided by the TurbEvent dataset, showcasing superior performance.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: P$^3$A is a novel adversarial patch attack framework for autonomous driving, improving attack effectiveness and transferability on high-resolution datasets with new metrics and techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities in learning-based autonomous driving systems to adversarial patches, especially black-box attacks, by improving attack success rates and transferability.

Method: Introduces Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL), and Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) for optimized attacks on high-resolution datasets.

Result: P$^3$A outperforms state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and high-resolution datasets under both practical and traditional metrics.

Conclusion: P$^3$A provides a more effective and practical framework for adversarial patch attacks in autonomous driving, enhancing safety and security.

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

TL;DR: Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA) improves single image super-resolution by addressing high-frequency detail loss and aliasing artifacts with a lightweight, efficient module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional upsamplers often fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce aliasing artifacts, motivating the need for a better solution.

Method: FGA integrates a Fourier feature-based MLP for frequency encoding, a cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer for alignment, and a frequency-domain L1 loss for supervision.

Result: FGA enhances performance across five super-resolution backbones, achieving PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and 29% better frequency-domain consistency.

Conclusion: FGA is a practical, scalable alternative to traditional upsampling methods, effectively reducing aliasing and preserving fine details.

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metal artifacts in CT imaging degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing deep learning methods struggle to balance artifact suppression and structural preservation.

Method: FIND-Net combines Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and trainable Gaussian filtering, operating in both spatial and frequency domains for enhanced artifact reduction and detail preservation.

Result: FIND-Net shows significant improvements: 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, validated on synthetic and real-world clinical CT scans.

Conclusion: FIND-Net advances MAR performance with superior structural preservation and clinical applicability, demonstrating robustness across varying artifact complexities.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance improves synthetic data diversity and quality using real exemplars, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal real images and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between generation quality and diversity in conditional image generative models, and mitigating distribution shifts between synthetic and real data.

Method: Introduces Chamfer Guidance, a training-free approach leveraging real exemplar images to characterize synthetic data quality and diversity.

Result: Achieves 96.4% precision and 86.4% coverage with 2 real images, improving to 97.5% and 92.7% with 32 images. Boosts downstream classifier accuracy by up to 16%.

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance effectively balances quality and diversity, enhancing synthetic data utility for training while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

Method: Creates a 177k-image dataset with 152k temporal pairs and sensor metadata, annotates with GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0, and fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using LoRA adapters.

Result: Achieves strong performance (BERT-F1 0.903) in temporal and "what-if" reasoning, rivaling state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: ChatENV is a powerful, sensor-aware tool for environmental monitoring and interactive analysis.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

*Ryan Ramos,Vladan Stojnić,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Yuta Nakashima,Giorgos Tolias,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how subtle, often imperceptible image acquisition parameters affect visual encoders, revealing their systematic encoding and impact on semantic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on severe corruptions causing distribution shifts. This study explores subtle, imperceptible parameters in image acquisition and their effects.

Method: Analyzes parameters of image acquisition and transformations, assessing their encoding in visual representations and impact on semantic predictions.

Result: Subtle parameters are systematically encoded and can significantly influence semantic predictions, depending on their correlation with labels.

Conclusion: Subtle image acquisition parameters can profoundly affect visual encoders, highlighting their overlooked role in semantic prediction performance.

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

*Helena Russello,Rik van der Tol,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A markerless lameness detection method using pose estimation and BLSTM neural networks achieves 85% accuracy, outperforming manual feature-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lameness detection in cows by eliminating manual feature engineering and working with short video sequences and small datasets.

Method: Combines T-LEAP pose estimation to extract keypoint trajectories from cow videos and a BLSTM classifier for binary lameness classification.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy, outperforming manual feature-based methods (80%), and works with just one second of video.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, efficient, and scalable for lameness detection in cows.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

### [139] [SemPT: Semantic Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10645)
*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT) improves visual transfer learning by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge, outperforming existing methods on 15 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of preserving category-specific representations while acquiring transferable knowledge in visual transfer learning for unseen categories.

Method: SemPT uses a two-step prompting strategy to extract shared visual attributes and generate attribute-level descriptions, followed by visually guided weighting and joint alignment of image and text embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: SemPT effectively balances discrimination and transferability, offering a robust solution for unseen category generalization.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

*Zhangyong Tang,Tianyang Xu,Xuefeng Zhu,Chunyang Cheng,Tao Zhou,Xiaojun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniBench300, a unified benchmark for multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), and reformulates the unification process in a serial format to address inconsistency and performance degradation. It leverages continual learning (CL) and demonstrates its superiority in stabilizing the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMVOT practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, leading to inconsistency between training and testing and performance degradation due to the absence of a unified benchmark.

Method: The work introduces UniBench300, a unified benchmark, and reformulates the unification process in a serial format, aligning it with continual learning (CL) principles.

Result: UniBench300 reduces inference passes and time consumption by 27%. CL stabilizes the unification process, and performance degradation is found to correlate with network capacity and modality discrepancies.

Conclusion: The proposed UniBench300 and CL-based unification process address key challenges in MMVOT, offering insights for future multi-modal vision research.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

*Shixiong Xu,Chenghao Zhang,Lubin Fan,Yuan Zhou,Bin Fan,Shiming Xiang,Gaofeng Meng,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AddressVLM enhances LVLMs for fine-grained street-level localization by integrating satellite-view and street-view images, improving accuracy by 9-12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs perform poorly in fine-grained street-level localization due to limited visual cues in street-view VQA data.

Method: Proposes cross-view alignment tuning with satellite and street-view images, and a two-stage training protocol (alignment and localization tuning).

Result: AddressVLM outperforms LVLMs by 9-12% in address localization accuracy on Pittsburgh and San Francisco datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating macro and micro visual cues significantly improves fine-grained localization in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

*Feiran Li,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Boyu Han,Zhiyong Yang,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to build a high-quality face dataset without overlapping identities, combining cleaned data, synthetic identities, and curriculum learning, achieving top competition results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a non-overlapping, diverse face dataset for training face recognition models, addressing the challenge of identity leakage and data quality.

Method: Cleans the HSFace dataset using MoE (clustering + GPT-4o verification), augments data, and generates synthetic identities via Stable Diffusion and Vec2Face. Uses curriculum learning for training.

Result: The dataset improves model performance across scales, securing 1st place in the DataCV ICCV Challenge.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach efficiently constructs a diverse, high-quality dataset, validated by competition success and performance gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

TL;DR: HyperTea integrates CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs to enhance multi-timescale feature representation for moving infrared small target detection (MIRSTD), achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for MIRSTD lack high-order correlation modeling and multi-timescale feature enhancement, limiting detection accuracy.

Method: HyperTea combines global (GTEM) and local (LTEM) temporal enhancement modules with a temporal alignment module (TAM) to model high-order spatiotemporal correlations.

Result: HyperTea outperforms existing methods on DAUB and IRDST datasets, demonstrating superior detection performance.

Conclusion: HyperTea effectively addresses MIRSTD challenges by leveraging hypergraphs and multi-timescale feature enhancement, setting a new benchmark for the task.

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: A method for T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI at 0.55T combines implicit neural representations with physics-informed regularization to address motion challenges, reducing scan time and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2 mapping in fetal MRI is hindered by motion-corrupted data and long scan times due to repeated acquisitions at each TE.

Method: Joint reconstruction of data across TEs using implicit neural representations and physics-informed regularization to model T2 decay.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on simulated and in vivo datasets, with the first in vivo fetal T2 mapping results at 0.55T.

Conclusion: The method reduces the need for multiple stacks per TE, leveraging anatomical redundancy for efficient T2 mapping.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

*Mengyang Zhao,Teng Fu,Haiyang Yu,Ke Niu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IADGPT, a framework for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD), addressing limitations of existing LVLMs by mimicking human-like reasoning and localization. It uses a three-stage training strategy and a new dataset for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs lack industrial knowledge and reasoning for FS-IAD, falling short of human inspectors. The goal is to bridge this gap with a specialized framework.

Method: Proposes IADGPT with a three-stage training strategy: acquiring industrial knowledge, discrepancy awareness, and in-context learning for generalization. Uses logits and attention maps for anomaly scoring.

Result: IADGPT shows significant gains in anomaly detection and performs competitively in localization and reasoning. A new dataset of 100K images supports training.

Conclusion: IADGPT effectively addresses FS-IAD challenges, outperforming existing methods, and will release a dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

### [146] [Novel View Synthesis using DDIM Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10688)
*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight framework, TUNet, synthesizes novel views from a single image using a pretrained diffusion model, avoiding expensive fine-tuning and improving detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis are costly and produce blurry results, prompting the need for an efficient, high-fidelity solution.

Method: Uses a camera pose-conditioned U-Net (TUNet) to predict target view latents from a DDIM-inverted input, enhanced by a noise correlation fusion strategy for detail preservation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MVImgNet, achieving sharper and more consistent novel views.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently leverages pretrained models for high-quality view synthesis without extensive retraining.

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCFNet, a motion cue fusion network combining RGB and event cameras to enhance object detection in low-light and dynamic traffic scenarios, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB cameras struggle with dynamic range and high-frequency detail loss in complex traffic environments, limiting object detection accuracy.

Method: MCFNet integrates event cameras with RGB cameras, using an event correction module (ECM) for temporal alignment, an event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) for spatial resolution enhancement, and a cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) for adaptive feature fusion.

Result: MCFNet outperforms existing methods, improving mAP50 by 7.4% and mAP by 1.7% on the DSEC-Det dataset.

Conclusion: The integration of event cameras and adaptive fusion in MCFNet significantly improves object detection in challenging lighting and fast-moving scenarios.

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountCluster, a method to improve object count accuracy in diffusion-based text-to-image models by clustering cross-attention maps early in the denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to accurately reflect the number of objects specified in prompts, often due to limitations in early-stage attention maps.

Method: CountCluster partitions the object cross-attention map into clusters based on input count, optimizes the latent to align with a target distribution, and avoids external tools or training.

Result: The method improves object count accuracy by 18.5% compared to existing approaches and works across diverse prompts.

Conclusion: CountCluster effectively addresses quantity control in text-to-image generation by leveraging early-stage attention maps.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Conclusion: NextStep-1 demonstrates the power of a unified autoregressive approach, with plans to release code and models for open research.

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous

*Fabian Kresse,Georgios Pilikos,Mario Azcueta,Nicolas Floury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes neural networks for real-time processing of unfocused SAR data on satellites, reducing downlink needs and enabling on-board deployment on FPGAs, with successful target classification demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Near-real-time maritime vessel monitoring with SAR data is limited by the need to downlink raw data for ground processing. On-board processing could reduce bandwidth and latency issues, but traditional methods are constrained by satellite resources.

Method: The authors design and evaluate neural networks for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data from Sentinel-1's Stripmap and IW modes, testing deployment feasibility on FPGAs.

Result: The study shows the feasibility of on-board processing with their models and successful binary classification between ships and windmills.

Conclusion: Neural networks can enable efficient on-board SAR data processing, addressing bandwidth and latency constraints while supporting target classification tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

### [151] [Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716)
*Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Lei Yu,Yi Liu,Mingtao Xiong,Lei Liang,Yongjun Zhang,Yi Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for cross-view localization by improving image matching and introduces a benchmark dataset (CVFM) with annotated correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-view localization lack strict correspondences, leading to coarse or inconsistent matches, which limits interpretability.

Method: The framework includes a Surface Model for accurate BEV projection and a SimRefiner module to refine similarity matrices without post-processing.

Result: The approach significantly enhances localization accuracy and matching quality, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses limitations of current techniques and provides a robust solution for cross-view localization.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

### [152] [Exploiting Discriminative Codebook Prior for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10719)
*Longxiang Tang,Ruihang Chu,Xiang Wang,Yujin Han,Pingyu Wu,Chunming He,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCPE, a method to better utilize token similarity in codebooks for autoregressive image generation, outperforming k-means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive models ignore the rich token similarity information in codebooks, and k-means clustering fails to exploit it effectively.

Method: Proposes DCPE, which uses instance-based distance and agglomerative merging to address token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy.

Result: DCPE accelerates training by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves FID and IS performance.

Conclusion: DCPE is a plug-and-play solution that enhances autoregressive model training by effectively mining codebook priors.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

### [153] [EgoCross: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Egocentric Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10729)
*Yanjun Li,Yuqian Fu,Tianwen Qian,Qi'ao Xu,Silong Dai,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool,Xiaoling Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoCross, a benchmark for evaluating cross-domain generalization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in EgocentricQA, highlighting their limitations in diverse real-world domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for EgocentricQA focus on common daily activities, lacking evaluation in diverse, high-impact domains like surgery or extreme sports.

Method: EgoCross is introduced, covering four challenging domains with 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, supporting OpenQA and CloseQA formats.

Result: Most MLLMs struggle with cross-domain generalization beyond daily activities, revealing current model limitations.

Conclusion: EgoCross aims to advance domain-adaptive egocentric video understanding, with pilot studies suggesting potential improvements through fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be
released at:

### [154] [Dissecting Generalized Category Discovery: Multiplex Consensus under Self-Deconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10731)
*Luyao Tang,Kunze Huang,Chaoqi Chen,Yuxuan Yuan,Chenxin Li,Xiaotong Tu,Xinghao Ding,Yue Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConGCD introduces a human-inspired method for generalized category discovery by decomposing objects into visual primitives and using consensus units for better recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human perceptual systems and machine learning in recognizing objects across known and novel categories.

Method: Decomposes objects into visual primitives, uses dominant and contextual consensus units, and dynamically optimizes activation pathways.

Result: Effective performance on coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks.

Conclusion: ConGCD is a consensus-aware paradigm that improves generalized category discovery.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The 2025 SSBC evaluated privacy-preserving sclera-segmentation models using synthetic data, comparing performance across synthetic-only and mixed-data tracks. Top models achieved competitive results, with synthetic data proving viable for biometric development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of synthetic data in training sclera-segmentation models while addressing privacy concerns in biometrics.

Method: Two competition tracks: (i) synthetic-only training and (ii) mixed synthetic-real data. Nine teams submitted diverse models, tested across three datasets.

Result: Synthetic-only models achieved competitive performance (F1 > 0.8), and mixed-track gains were method-driven, not data-driven.

Conclusion: Synthetic data holds promise for privacy-aware biometric development, with methodological choices playing a key role in performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code
and data for the competition is available at:

### [156] [Axis-level Symmetry Detection with Group-Equivariant Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10740)
*Wongyun Yu,Ahyun Seo,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for detecting reflection and rotation symmetry in complex scenes using geometric primitives and a dual-branch architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting symmetry in complex scenes is challenging, especially for precise axis-level identification of reflection and rotation symmetry.

Method: Uses a dual-branch architecture equivariant to the dihedral group, with orientational anchors for reflection symmetry and rotational matching for rotational symmetry.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in symmetry detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of precise symmetry axis detection, advancing the field of computer vision.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

### [157] [Forgery Guided Learning Strategy with Dual Perception Network for Deepfake Cross-domain Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10741)
*Lixin Jia,Zhiqing Guo,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy and Dual Perception Network (DPNet) are proposed to improve deepfake detection by adapting to unknown forgery techniques and capturing forgery trace relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing gap between emerging and traditional forgery techniques makes current deepfake detection methods ineffective, necessitating technology with strong generalization.

Method: The FGL strategy captures differential information between known and unknown techniques, while DPNet integrates frequency and spatial features and uses graph convolution for trace correlation.

Result: The approach generalizes well across scenarios and effectively handles unknown forgery challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FGL and DPNet offer robust support for deepfake detection, addressing the limitations of current techniques.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

*Ziwei Zou,Bei Zou,Xiaoyan Kui,Wenqi Lu,Haoran Dou,Arezoo Zakeri,Timothy Cootes,Alejandro F Frangi,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARC is a model-driven groupwise registration framework for atlas construction, offering flexibility, generalizability, and resource efficiency. It supports diverse metrics, handles large 3D datasets, and enables applications like one-shot segmentation and shape synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven methods for atlas construction rely on large datasets, lack generalizability, and struggle with inference in groupwise contexts. Model-driven methods, while theoretically sound, face scalability issues. DARC addresses these gaps.

Method: DARC uses a coordinate descent strategy and centrality-enforcing activation function for unbiased, diffeomorphic atlas construction. It supports various image dissimilarity metrics and efficiently processes large 3D datasets without GPU memory constraints.

Result: DARC produces high-fidelity atlases and outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot methods in one-shot segmentation. It also enables shape synthesis by generating anatomical variants via synthesized deformation fields.

Conclusion: DARC provides a scalable, efficient, and versatile solution for atlas construction and related applications, overcoming limitations of both data-driven and model-driven approaches.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates VLMs' spatio-physical reasoning, finds them lacking due to biases and shallow reasoning, improves Qwen2.5-VL-7B via fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, but notes limited generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance VLMs' spatio-physical reasoning, a critical but underexplored capability for robust world models.

Method: Diagnostic analysis of VLMs, supervised fine-tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Result: Improved spatio-physical reasoning in Qwen2.5-VL-7B, outperforming proprietary models, but limited generalization.

Conclusion: Despite improvements, new approaches are needed for better generalization in spatio-physical reasoning.

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

TL;DR: AEGIS is a large-scale benchmark for detecting hyper-realistic AI-generated videos, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks with diverse, state-of-the-art synthetic content and multimodal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic synthetic videos threatens societal trust, but current benchmarks lack realism, scale, and complexity to evaluate modern detection models effectively.

Method: AEGIS includes over 10,000 real and synthetic videos from advanced generative models, with challenging subsets and multimodal annotations (Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, Low-level Visual Features).

Result: Experiments show limited detection capabilities of advanced vision-language models on AEGIS's challenging subsets, highlighting its complexity and realism.

Conclusion: AEGIS advances research by providing a robust benchmark for developing reliable video authenticity detection methods to counter real-world forgery threats.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

### [161] [Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774)
*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE is a data-free joint training framework combining Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention and sparsity-aware step distillation to accelerate diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant speedups and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers face slow iterative denoising and high computational costs for long sequences, requiring efficient acceleration without compromising quality.

Method: BLADE introduces Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) for dynamic sparsity masks and sparsity-aware step distillation via Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM).

Result: BLADE achieves 14.10x speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and 8.89x on CogVideoX-5B, with improved VBench-2.0 scores (e.g., 0.569 from 0.534).

Conclusion: BLADE effectively combines acceleration strategies, offering faster inference and better quality, validated by benchmarks and human evaluations.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

TL;DR: TriFlowSR is a novel framework for Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) that improves alignment between LR and reference HR images, introducing the Landmark-4K dataset for UHD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based RefSR methods struggle with alignment and lack high-quality datasets, limiting restoration quality.

Method: TriFlowSR uses a Reference Matching Strategy for better pattern matching and introduces the Landmark-4K dataset for UHD scenarios.

Result: The approach outperforms previous methods in utilizing semantic and texture information from reference HR images.

Conclusion: TriFlowSR is the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline for UHD landmark scenarios under real-world degradation.

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a cooperative video-based face liveness detection method using controlled face movement and optical flow analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve discrimination between genuine faces and presentation attacks (e.g., photos, screens, masks, video replays).

Method: Users move their face closer to the camera; optical flow analysis extracts facial volume info, processed by a neural classifier.

Result: Enhanced liveness detection by leveraging spatial-temporal features.

Conclusion: The method outperforms passive approaches in reliability.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

TL;DR: VasoMIM, a novel self-supervised learning framework, improves vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms by integrating vascular anatomy into masked image modeling, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated data and the failure of conventional MIM to capture vascular anatomy due to class imbalance drive the need for a tailored solution.

Method: VasoMIM uses an anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss to focus on vessel-relevant regions and improve vascular representation.

Result: VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets, demonstrating superior vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: VasoMIM effectively addresses the limitations of conventional MIM and shows promise for enhancing X-ray angiogram analysis.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

*Ziqi Ye,Shuran Ma,Jie Yang,Xiaoyi Yang,Ziyang Gong,Xue Yang,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OF-Diff improves remote sensing image generation by using object shape priors and a dual-branch diffusion model, outperforming existing methods in fidelity and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images, impacting object detection reliability in remote sensing.

Method: Proposes OF-Diff with prior shape extraction, dual-branch diffusion, and DDPO for fine-tuning.

Result: Significant improvements in mAP for airplanes (8.3%), ships (7.7%), and vehicles (4.0%).

Conclusion: OF-Diff enhances fidelity and diversity in remote sensing image generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Motivation: To advance UI interaction by creating a high-performance agent that relies solely on screenshots, reducing dependency on extensive training data and improving generalization in complex tasks.

Method: Leverages reinforcement finetuning (RFT) on Qwen2.5-VL, introduces reward functions, data cleaning strategies, and a self-evolving framework for trajectory history alignment and sparse action enhancement.

Conclusion: UI-Venus sets new benchmarks for UI agents, offering open-source tools, data protocols, and frameworks to spur further research in UI navigation and grounding.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on
Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /
50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaCon-Stereo introduces a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo matching, addressing occlusion issues with a teacher-student paradigm and multi-baseline inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric consistency fails in occluded regions, leading to ill-posed correspondences. BaCon-Stereo aims to improve stereo matching in both occluded and non-occluded areas.

Method: Uses a teacher-student framework with multi-baseline inputs, occlusion-aware attention, and a synthesized dataset (BaCon-20k) for training.

Result: Improves prediction in occluded/non-occluded regions, shows strong generalization, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo is effective for self-supervised stereo matching, with plans to release code and dataset.

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: AdaptFED extends TransFed by refining focal modulation in FL, introducing task-aware embeddings, improved theoretical bounds, and broader empirical validation, while reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generalizability and scalability of transformer-based FL, addressing non-IID and cross-domain challenges.

Method: Incorporates task-aware client embeddings, refines adaptation strategy, and uses low-rank hypernetwork conditioning for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in diverse datasets, especially in source-free and cross-task FL setups.

Conclusion: AdaptFED advances FL by improving adaptability, scalability, and generalizability of transformer-based systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

### [170] [Hierarchical Fine-grained Preference Optimization for Physically Plausible Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10858)
*Harold Haodong Chen,Haojian Huang,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang,Ser-Nam Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHPO introduces hierarchical cross-modal preference optimization to improve physical plausibility in video generation by aligning preferences at instance, state, motion, and semantic levels, leveraging automated data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation lacks adherence to physical laws, limiting realism and accuracy. PhysHPO addresses this by fine-tuning preference alignment and using real-world video data.

Method: PhysHPO optimizes video alignment hierarchically (instance, state, motion, semantic levels) and employs an automated pipeline to select high-quality data from existing datasets.

Result: PhysHPO enhances physical plausibility and video quality, outperforming benchmarks in physics-focused and general video generation tasks.

Conclusion: PhysHPO pioneers fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, advancing realism and human preference in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5 models were tested for brain tumor classification via VQA on MRI data, with GPT-5-mini performing best (44.19% accuracy), though none reached clinical reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor classification on MRI is crucial for treatment planning, and LLMs offer potential for integrating image interpretation with reasoning.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a BraTS-derived VQA benchmark, assessing zero-shot chain-of-thought accuracy.

Result: GPT-5-mini led with 44.19% accuracy, but performance varied by tumor type, and none met clinical standards.

Conclusion: GPT-5 models show promise for neuro-oncological VQA but lack sufficient accuracy for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single stage, reducing manual effort and improving flexibility in cartoon production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cartoon production stages are manual and error-prone; existing AI methods handle them separately, leading to artifacts.

Method: ToonComposer uses sparse sketch injection and a cartoon adaptation method with a spatial low-rank adapter to unify inbetweening and colorization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and efficiency, as demonstrated by PKBench.

Conclusion: ToonComposer offers a superior, flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production, reducing manual workload.

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R is a novel 3D reconstruction method using a decoder-only Transformer, outperforming existing techniques with efficient streaming and causal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view 3D reconstruction are either computationally expensive or scale poorly with sequence length, limiting their practicality.

Method: STream3R uses a streaming framework with causal attention, inspired by language modeling, and learns geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets.

Result: The method outperforms prior work in static and dynamic scenes and is compatible with LLM-style training for scalability.

Conclusion: STream3R demonstrates the potential of causal Transformer models for real-time 3D perception in streaming environments.

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Motivation: Adapting self-supervised learning to the unique characteristics of Earth observation data, which is multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking of fusion strategies and reconstruction target normalization, leading to the proposal of MAESTRO with optimized fusion and spectral prior-based normalization.

Result: MAESTRO sets a new state-of-the-art on multitemporal tasks and remains competitive on mono-temporal tasks, validated on four datasets.

Conclusion: MAESTRO effectively addresses the challenges of Earth observation data, offering a robust self-supervised learning approach.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL proposes a memory-efficient method for video class-incremental learning by integrating episodic and semantic memory, achieving high performance with reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCIL methods face a trade-off between memory efficiency and performance, either using dense samples (memory-heavy) or sparse samples (performance loss).

Method: ESSENTIAL combines episodic memory (sparse features) and semantic memory (learnable prompts) via a novel memory retrieval module using cross-attention.

Result: Validated on multiple datasets, ESSENTIAL achieves strong performance while significantly reducing memory usage.

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL effectively balances memory efficiency and performance in VCIL, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified cross-domain model (HiC) for 3D human motion, improving generalization, scalability, and performance over existing methods like PiC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain models rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, limiting practicality and scalability.

Method: Introduces Human-in-Context (HiC), extending Pose-in-Context (PiC) by combining pose and mesh representations, expanding task coverage, and using a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy.

Result: HiC outperforms PiC in generalization, data scale, and performance across diverse domains.

Conclusion: HiC demonstrates potential for a flexible, scalable unified cross-domain 3D human motion model.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer is a framework for automatic rigging and animation of 3D models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in skeletal prediction and skinning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformation of static 3D models into animated assets is a bottleneck in content creation, requiring expert intervention despite advances in generative AI.

Method: Puppeteer uses an auto-regressive transformer for skeletal prediction, an attention-based architecture for skinning weights, and a differentiable optimization-based animation pipeline.

Result: The system outperforms existing methods in accuracy and quality, handling diverse 3D content and producing stable animations without jittering.

Conclusion: Puppeteer provides a robust solution for automating rigging and animation, addressing key challenges in 3D content creation.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

*Shuteng Wang,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QVF introduces a quantum-based method for 2D/3D visual field learning, outperforming classical and existing quantum approaches in accuracy and detail retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in QINRs like architecture design, training efficiency, and quantum-classical interplay by proposing a novel Quantum Visual Field (QVF) approach.

Method: Uses neural amplitude encoding and fully entangled parametrized quantum circuits in real Hilbert space for stable training and fast convergence.

Result: QVF surpasses existing quantum and classical methods in visual representation accuracy and high-frequency detail learning.

Conclusion: QVF shows practical potential in 2D/3D field completion and shape interpolation, advancing quantum-based visual learning.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

### [181] [Nested-ReFT: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning via Off-Policy Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10123)
*Maxime Heuillet,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Audrey Durand,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nested-ReFT introduces a computationally efficient ReFT framework by using a subset of model layers as a behavior model, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ReFT frameworks are computationally expensive due to multiple inference steps during training.

Method: Nested-ReFT leverages off-policy RL and speculative decoding, using dynamic layer skipping to reduce inference costs.

Result: Improved computational efficiency (tokens/sec) on math reasoning benchmarks, with unbiased gradient estimates and controlled variance.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT balances efficiency and performance, matching baseline ReFT while reducing costs.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yuhuai Qin,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA) to address reward sparsity and misalignment in long-horizon RL, specifically for software engineering tasks, improving completion and modification rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward sparsity and misalignment in long-horizon RL tasks hinder performance, especially in software engineering where multi-turn reasoning and verification are crucial.

Method: Proposes the SWE-oriented RL Framework and G-RA, which accumulates immediate rewards only when long-term rewards meet a threshold, ensuring stable optimization.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in completion rates (47.6% to 93.8%) and modification rates (19.6% to 23.8%), avoiding policy degradation.

Conclusion: G-RA effectively balances reward accumulation in long-horizon RL, offering a practical solution for software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

*Zhipeng Chen,Xiaobo Qin,Youbin Wu,Yue Ling,Qinghao Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR improves exploration by using Pass@k as reward, showing mutual enhancement of exploration and exploitation, and suggests advantage design as a future direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of balancing exploration and exploitation in RLVR, where Pass@1 rewards lead to conservative policies and local optima.

Method: Use Pass@k as reward (Pass@k Training), analyze its advantage, and explore advantage design for RLVR.

Result: Pass@k Training improves exploration, and exploration/exploitation can mutually enhance each other.

Conclusion: Advantage design for RLVR shows promise and is a potential future direction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration, prompting a need for memory-augmented solutions inspired by neuroscience.

Method: Proposes a framework combining neuroscience principles (dynamic memory, attention, consolidation) with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers, categorized by functional objectives, memory representations, and integration mechanisms.

Result: Identifies a shift toward adaptive, test-time learning systems and highlights solutions like hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates.

Conclusion: The synthesis offers a roadmap for developing cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures, though challenges like scalability and interference remain.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

*Ke Niu,Haiyang Yu,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Teng Fu,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAD-RL is a multimodal reinforcement learning framework for generating CAD code from natural language, improving reasoning, precision, and executability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD workflows require expertise and manual effort; LLMs offer potential for automation but face challenges in translating design intent accurately.

Method: Combines Chain-of-Thought guided reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards and optimization strategies like Trust Region Stretch and Precision Token Loss.

Result: Outperforms existing VLMs in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability.

Conclusion: CAD-RL advances CAD automation by effectively translating natural language into executable code.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

*Will Fein,Ryan J. Horwitz,John E. Brown III,Amit Misra,Felipe Oviedo,Kevin White,Juan M. Lavista Ferres,Samuel K. Wasser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-driven handwriting analysis on seized ivory tusks provides a scalable, low-cost forensic method to link trafficking shipments, complementing DNA evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transnational ivory trade drives elephant population declines, but current forensic methods like DNA analysis are costly or unavailable. Handwritten markings on tusks, though easy to photograph, are rarely analyzed.

Method: An AI pipeline was developed to extract and analyze handwritten markings from 6,085 photographs of seized tusks, identifying recurring 'signature markings' to link shipments.

Result: The study identified 184 signature markings, with 20 linking multiple seizures, establishing forensic connections between traffickers.

Conclusion: AI-based handwriting analysis offers a transformative, scalable tool for wildlife forensics, filling gaps where other data is unavailable and aiding efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynBrain is a generative framework for modeling the probabilistic transformation of visual stimuli to neural responses, outperforming existing methods in fMRI synthesis and decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic methods fail to capture biological variability and functional consistency in neural responses to visual stimuli.

Method: SynBrain uses BrainVAE for probabilistic neural representation and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper to project visual semantics into neural responses.

Result: SynBrain excels in subject-specific fMRI encoding, adapts to new subjects with minimal data, and improves fMRI-to-image decoding.

Conclusion: SynBrain effectively models neural variability and functional consistency, offering high-fidelity fMRI synthesis and interpretable patterns.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: FedKEI is a federated learning framework that uses cross-task knowledge transfer for efficient adapter tuning in healthcare, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quick adaptation to new healthcare tasks while preserving privacy and leveraging past knowledge.

Method: FedKEI employs global clustering and bi-level optimization for personalized knowledge transfer via inter- and intra-cluster weights.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new diseases across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FedKEI effectively leverages past knowledge for efficient task adaptation in federated healthcare settings.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral framework is introduced to analyze and quantify the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness in explanations of ReLU networks, addressing noisy gradient-based interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU networks produce noisy and hard-to-interpret gradient-based explanations, and existing smoothing methods like GradCAM sacrifice faithfulness.

Method: A spectral framework is developed to analyze smoothness and faithfulness, regularizing high-frequency contributions in ReLU networks.

Result: The framework identifies an "explanation gap" caused by surrogate-based smoothing and validates findings across datasets and ablations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a principled way to balance smoothness and faithfulness in explanations, improving interpretability.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes deep network explanations using probabilistic and spectral perspectives, identifying spectral bias and proposing remedies for inconsistent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliability issues in explaining deep network predictions by providing a formal analysis.

Method: Adopts probabilistic and spectral perspectives to analyze explanation methods, identifies spectral bias, and proposes remedies like standard perturbation scale and SpectralLens.

Result: Reveals spectral bias in gradient-based methods and introduces solutions for inconsistent explanations.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and practical improvements for reliable deep network explanations.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Generative AI (GenAI) for forecasting land-use and land-cover change (LULC), demonstrating its feasibility with a diffusion model for imperviousness forecasting in the U.S.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LULC forecasting lags behind hydrologic and atmospheric forecasting, limiting risk assessment for future scenarios.

Method: Frames LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem using GenAI, specifically training a diffusion model on historical U.S. imperviousness data.

Result: The model outperforms a no-change baseline for resolutions ≥ 0.7×0.7 km², showing it captures significant spatiotemporal patterns.

Conclusion: The approach is promising, with future work planned to integrate Earth's physical properties and scenario simulation via driver variables.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Result: DxDirector-7B outperforms state-of-the-art medical and general-purpose LLMs in accuracy and workload reduction across rare, complex, and real-world cases.

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B marks a paradigm shift, enabling AI to lead diagnosis, significantly reducing physician workload and improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

### [194] [Diversity First, Quality Later: A Two-Stage Assumption for Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10530)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of static vs. on-policy preference data in LM alignment, proposing a two-stage alignment process (preference injection and fine-tuning) and a method to identify their boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LMs with human preferences is crucial for reliable AI, but the effectiveness of on-policy vs. static data varies, prompting the need for a deeper understanding.

Method: Proposes the alignment stage assumption (two stages: preference injection and fine-tuning) and an algorithm to identify boundaries between them, tested on 5 models and 2 alignment methods.

Result: On-policy data can be 3x more effective for Llama-3 but 0.4x for Zephyr, highlighting the need for stage-specific data strategies.

Conclusion: The alignment stage assumption and boundary measurement generalize across models and methods, improving LM alignment strategies.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

### [195] [Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Low-Cost Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10539)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComMCS, a method to reduce variance in value-based process verifiers for LLMs, improving reasoning accuracy without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' success, their reasoning in complex domains like math is limited. Current methods suffer from high variance in training annotations due to costly LLM inference.

Method: Proposes ComMCS, a compound Monte Carlo sampling method that combines MC estimators from current and subsequent steps to reduce variance while remaining unbiased.

Result: ComMCS outperforms baselines, achieving 2.8 and 2.2 point improvements on MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: ComMCS effectively reduces variance in LLM reasoning tasks, enhancing performance without additional inference costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0 enhances MLLMs' mathematical reasoning via a structured knowledge system, model-centric data modeling, and RL-based training, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex math reasoning, lacking comprehensive knowledge-driven design and data space modeling.

Method: Integrates a hierarchical knowledge system, dual-dataset construction (MathBook-Standard & Pro), and a two-stage RL framework (Cold-Start Fine-tuning & Progressive Alignment RL).

Result: Competitive performance on benchmarks and strong results on MathBookEval, showing generalization in math reasoning.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0 effectively improves MLLMs' math reasoning through structured knowledge and RL training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating graphic designs holistically by aggregating expert feedback.

Method: AgenticDRS uses multiple agents orchestrated by a meta-agent, with in-context exemplar selection (graph matching) and prompt expansion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validated by DRS-BENCH and ablation experiments.

Conclusion: AgenticDRS effectively evaluates designs and generates actionable feedback, highlighting an under-explored research direction.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

### [199] [Context Misleads LLMs: The Role of Context Filtering in Maintaining Safe Alignment of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10031)
*Jinhwa Kim,Ian G. Harris*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new defense mechanism, Context Filtering, is proposed to filter adversarial context in LLMs, reducing jailbreak attack success by up to 88% while preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the safety and ethical risks posed by jailbreak attacks on LLMs, which exploit adversarial context to generate harmful responses.

Method: Proposes Context Filtering, an input pre-processing method to filter untrustworthy context and identify primary prompts with real user intent.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rates by up to 88% and maintains LLM performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play Context Filtering model enhances LLM safety without fine-tuning, applicable to all LLMs, and will be publicly available.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

### [200] [Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880)
*Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A search-based framework using LLMs simulates multi-turn interactions to uncover and mitigate privacy threats from malicious agents, revealing evolving attack and defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy threat posed by malicious LLM-based agents that adaptively extract sensitive information through dynamic dialogues.

Method: A search-based framework alternates between improving attacker and defender instructions via simulated interactions involving data subject, sender, and recipient roles. LLMs optimize the search process.

Result: Attack strategies evolve from direct requests to sophisticated tactics like impersonation, while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification state machines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies and mitigates privacy threats, demonstrating practical utility for developing privacy-aware agents.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Water4MU, a novel approach using digital watermarking to enhance machine unlearning (MU) by modifying data content, outperforming existing methods in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in MU algorithms by exploring data-level adjustments, leveraging watermarking for precise data removal while maintaining model utility.

Method: Proposes Water4MU, a bi-level optimization framework: upper level optimizes watermarking for unlearning ease, lower level trains the model independently.

Result: Water4MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data and outperforms existing MU methods, especially in 'challenging forgets'.

Conclusion: Water4MU provides a robust solution for MU by integrating watermarking, enhancing precision and effectiveness in data removal.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) were compared to humans in abstract reasoning tasks, showing that only the largest LLMs (~70B parameters) matched human accuracy and neural patterns. Their intermediate layers clustered abstract patterns similarly to human brain activity, suggesting shared mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs replicate human neurocognition during abstract reasoning, comparing their performance and neural representations with humans.

Method: Human participants and eight open-source LLMs were tested on an abstract-pattern-completion task. Performance and neural data (EEG, FRPs) were analyzed.

Result: Only the largest LLMs achieved human-like accuracy and pattern-specific difficulty profiles. Their intermediate layers clustered abstract patterns, correlating with human frontal FRPs.

Conclusion: LLMs may mirror human brain mechanisms in abstract reasoning, hinting at shared principles between biological and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human
neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and
neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source
LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type
differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as
recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate
that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve
human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing
similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,
every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract
pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of
this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive
correlations were observed between the representational geometries of
task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently
diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and
resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract
patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in
abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between
biological and artificial intelligence.

Motivation: To advance computational neuroscience by modeling brain responses to complex, naturalistic stimuli.

Method: Teams built models to predict fMRI responses across 1,000 brain parcels using 80 hours of movie stimuli, including training and validation sets.

Result: The top team's model best predicted brain activity for held-out OOD films, with MedARC placing 4th.

Conclusion: The challenge highlights progress in brain encoding and sets the stage for future advancements in modeling naturalistic stimuli.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for code completion rely on superficial text similarity, leading to semantic misguidance, redundancy, and unresolved symbol ambiguity.

Method: Saracoder uses a Hierarchical Feature Optimization module for deep semantic analysis, duplicate pruning, structural similarity assessment, and reranking. An External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity.

Result: Saracoder outperforms baselines on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks across multiple languages and models.

Conclusion: Systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions improves accuracy and robustness in repository-level code completion.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

Motivation: Early detection of lung cancer improves survival, and automated, interpretable methods are needed, especially in resource-limited settings.

Method: Custom CNN and fine-tuned DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19 models are trained with cost-sensitive learning on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. SHAP is used for explainability.

Result: ResNet152 achieved 97.3% accuracy, while DenseNet121 balanced precision, recall, and F1-score best (up to 92%, 90%, 91%).

Conclusion: CNN-based methods with explainability offer fast, accurate, and interpretable lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We
present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from
chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence
contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate
that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast,
accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in
resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical
care and training.

*Soorena Salari,Catherine Spino,Laurie-Anne Pharand,Fabienne Lathuiliere,Hassan Rivaz,Silvain Beriault,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DINOMotion is a deep learning framework for accurate and interpretable motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy, using DINOv2 and LoRA layers for robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI face challenges with large misalignments and lack interpretability, necessitating a more robust and transparent solution.

Method: DINOMotion combines DINOv2's feature representations with LoRA layers to detect landmarks and compute image registration directly, reducing trainable parameters and improving efficiency.

Result: Achieves high Dice scores (92.07% kidney, 90.90% liver, 95.23% lung) and low Hausdorff distances (5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, 6.72 mm), processing scans in ~30ms.

Conclusion: DINOMotion is a promising, efficient, and interpretable solution for real-time motion tracking in radiotherapy.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Haar-tSVD is a simple, efficient denoising algorithm leveraging nonlocal self-similarity and PCA-Haar transform connections, offering fast, parallelizable noise removal without learning local bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High demand for efficient image denoising due to increasing imaging data and devices.

Method: Uses tensor-SVD with Haar transform to capture global/local patch correlations, plus adaptive noise estimation via CNN and eigenvalue analysis.

Result: Effective noise removal and detail preservation in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD balances speed and performance, validated by experiments, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

*Xinyi Wang,Angeliki Katsenou,David Bull*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel NR-VQA model using spatio-temporal fragmentation and inter-frame variations achieves top performance on UGC datasets with low runtime complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of UGC demands efficient NR-VQA for quality monitoring without pristine references.

Method: The model analyzes quality-sensitive regions at multiple levels (frames, patches, fragmented frames) using 2D/3D features from inter-frame variations.

Result: Ranked top 2 in performance (DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898, DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886) and top in speed among NR-VQA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively balances performance and efficiency for NR-VQA in UGC applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-correction Flywheel, a post-training paradigm for vision-and-language navigation models, leveraging error trajectories as valuable data to enhance model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack effective error correction, leading to deviations from correct trajectories. The goal is to improve recovery from errors.

Method: The paradigm identifies deviations in error trajectories and generates self-correction data for perception and action, fueling continued training.

Result: The model CorrectNav achieves state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3% on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, surpassing prior models by 8.2% and 16.4%.

Conclusion: The Self-correction Flywheel significantly improves error correction, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and long instruction following, validated by real robot tests.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

TL;DR: ReconVLA improves Vision-Language-Action models by guiding visual attention to target regions using a reconstructive approach with a diffusion transformer, enhancing manipulation precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs struggle with dispersed visual attention, hindering accurate target manipulation.

Method: Proposes ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model using a diffusion transformer to reconstruct gaze regions, improving attention allocation.

Result: Demonstrates superior manipulation precision and generalization in experiments, supported by a large pretraining dataset.

Conclusion: ReconVLA effectively addresses visual attention issues in VLAs, enabling precise manipulation and better generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

Conclusion: ParseJargon is effective for jargon management, with potential for broader interdisciplinary and educational use.

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time
meetings, highlighting both opportunities and limitations for real-world
deployment. Our findings contribute insights into designing personalized jargon
support tools, with implications for broader interdisciplinary and educational
applications.
