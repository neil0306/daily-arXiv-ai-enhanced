In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight\nchallenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and\nprovide insights for enhancing their reliability.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRWM improves world model performance by enforcing geometric regularization in latent space, leading to more stable long-horizon predictions without requiring larger dynamics modules.", "motivation": "Current world models degrade over long horizons due to poor representation quality from high-dimensional, lossy, or entangled latent representations that make dynamics learning difficult.", "method": "Proposes Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM) that enforce consecutive points along sensory trajectories to remain close in latent space, improving representation alignment with environment topology.", "result": "GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, learning latent manifolds with superior geometric structure.", "conclusion": "Improving representation learning is a direct and effective path to robust world models, enabling reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging dynamics modules."}}
