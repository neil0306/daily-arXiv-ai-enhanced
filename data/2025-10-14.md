### [1] [Table Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Tasks, Methods, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09671)
*Wei Zhou,Bolei Ma,Annemarie Friedrich,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Table Question Answering (TQA) research, focusing on LLM-based methods, by categorizing benchmarks, analyzing modeling strategies, and identifying underexplored research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks systematic organization and understanding of TQA task formulations, challenges, and methodological trends, particularly with emerging research directions like reinforcement learning and LLM advancements.

Method: Provides structured categorization of TQA benchmarks and task setups, groups modeling strategies by targeted challenges, and analyzes their strengths and limitations.

Result: Offers a consolidated foundation for the TQA community by unifying disparate research threads and identifying open problems.

Conclusion: The survey enables deeper understanding of state-of-the-art TQA and guides future developments in this rapidly evolving area.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions
about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text
passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation,
question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in
TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task
formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light
of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey
addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA
research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive
categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current
modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their
strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely
topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying
disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a
consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding
of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly
evolving area.

### [2] [Emotionally Charged, Logically Blurred: AI-driven Emotional Framing Impairs Human Fallacy Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09695)
*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can inject emotional appeals into fallacious arguments, reducing human fallacy detection by 14.5% on average, with enjoyment perception correlating with better detection than fear or sadness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logical fallacies mislead audiences despite lacking soundness, and emotional framing's interaction with fallacies and convincingness hasn't been computationally studied.

Method: Benchmarked 8 LLMs on injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving logical structures, then used best models to generate stimuli for human study.

Result: LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection by 14.5% F1 score; humans detect fallacies better when perceiving enjoyment vs fear/sadness; these three emotions correlate with higher convincingness.

Conclusion: The study reveals implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation in fallacious argumentation, showing how emotional framing can impair human reasoning.

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

### [3] [The Idola Tribus of AI: Large Language Models tend to perceive order where none exists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09709)
*Shin-nosuke Ishikawa,Masato Todo,Taiki Ogihara,Hirotsugu Ohba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs tend to generate absurd patterns when analyzing number sequences, over-recognizing non-existent patterns in random series despite their clear inappropriateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' logical consistency and self-coherence, which are crucial for complex real-world applications like retrieval-augmented generation and AI agent frameworks.

Method: Conducted experiments asking LLMs to explain patterns in various integer sequences, including arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences, and randomly generated integer series.

Result: LLMs successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences but frequently over-recognized inconsistent patterns in randomly generated series, even with multi-step reasoning models like OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking.

Conclusion: This tendency represents an AI equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights limitations in LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities, even when using chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

### [4] [SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710)
*Xiaonan Si,Meilin Zhu,Simeng Qin,Lijia Yu,Lijun Zhang,Shuaitong Liu,Xinfeng Li,Ranjie Duan,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeCon-RAG is a two-stage semantic filtering framework that protects RAG systems from corpus poisoning attacks while preserving valuable information, outperforming existing defense methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks that compromise output integrity, while existing defenses use aggressive filtering that causes unnecessary information loss and reduced reliability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Semantic and cluster-based filtering guided by EIRE extractor that scores semantic relevance and builds clean retrieval database; 2) EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering that analyzes semantic consistency between query, answers, and retrieved knowledge to filter contradictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show SeCon-RAG significantly improves generation robustness and output trustworthiness, markedly outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods across various LLMs and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving trustworthy RAG through semantic filtering and conflict-free processing.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

### [5] [ReaLM: Residual Quantization Bridging Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09711)
*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Lingbing Guo,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLMs using residual vector quantization to discretize KG embeddings into code sequences, achieving state-of-the-art KGC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based KGC methods struggle to exploit structured semantic representations due to misalignment between continuous KG embedding space and discrete LLM token space, limiting semantic transfer and performance.

Method: Uses residual vector quantization to discretize pretrained KG embeddings into compact code sequences, integrates them as learnable tokens in LLM vocabulary, and incorporates ontology-guided class constraints for semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in Knowledge Graph Completion.

Conclusion: ReaLM effectively aligns structured knowledge with large-scale language models through the proposed quantization and integration framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

### [6] [All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09714)
*Shiyuan Guo,Henry Sleight,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models struggle with ciphered reasoning despite understanding ciphers, creating a vulnerability for evading chain-of-thought monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the risk of attackers and misaligned AI models evading chain-of-thought monitoring through ciphered reasoning (encrypted, translated, or compressed text).

Method: Tested 28 different ciphers by fine-tuning and prompting up to 10 models to reason in each cipher, using math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.

Result: Found an asymmetry: model accuracy drops significantly in ciphered text despite comprehension ability; frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers; capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data; scaling laws show slow improvement with fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: Ciphered reasoning evasion may be ineffective for current models, but provides guidance for constraining this capability in future frontier models.

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

### [7] [Preference-Aware Memory Update for Long-Term LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09720)
*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PAMU, a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism that dynamically refines memory representations using sliding window averages and exponential moving averages to capture both short-term and long-term user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-term memory approaches for LLM agents lack mechanisms for dynamically updating preference memory representations in response to evolving user behaviors and contexts.

Method: Integrates sliding window averages (SW) with exponential moving averages (EMA) to construct fused preference-aware representations that capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies.

Result: Experiments on five task scenarios of the LoCoMo dataset show significant improvement in output quality across five baselines, validating effectiveness in long-term conversations.

Conclusion: PAMU mechanism successfully addresses the memory updating gap and enables dynamic, personalized memory refinement for LLM-based agents.

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

*Fanwei Zhu,Jinke Yu,Zulong Chen,Ying Zhou,Junhao Ji,Zhibo Yang,Yuxue Zhang,Haoyuan Hu,Zhenghao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A layout-aware, efficiency-optimized framework for automated resume extraction that addresses heterogeneity, LLM costs, and evaluation challenges through layout parsing, efficient LLM extraction, and automated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three major challenges in automated resume extraction: extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, high cost and latency of LLMs, and lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools.

Method: Combines fine-tuned layout parser for document normalization, inference-efficient LLM extractor using parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and robust two-stage automated evaluation framework with new benchmark datasets.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. A fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while reducing inference latency and computational cost.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in resume extraction and is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across business units.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

### [9] [VisRAG 2.0: Evidence-Guided Multi-Image Reasoning in Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09733)
*Yubo Sun,Chunyi Peng,Yukun Yan,Shi Yu,Zhenghao Liu,Chi Chen,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVisRAG is an end-to-end framework that enhances vision-language models by learning to reason with evidence-guided multi-image analysis, using a novel training method called RS-GRPO to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and erroneous conclusions in visual question answering tasks.

Method: Proposes EVisRAG framework that first observes retrieved images and records per-image evidence, then derives final answers from aggregated evidence. Uses Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO) to bind fine-grained rewards to scope-specific tokens for joint optimization of visual perception and reasoning.

Result: Achieves 27% average improvement over backbone VLM on multiple visual question answering benchmarks. Shows enhanced answer accuracy through precise perception and localization of question-relevant evidence across multiple images.

Conclusion: EVisRAG effectively addresses multi-image reasoning challenges in VRAG systems by enabling evidence-guided reasoning, much like a detective approach, leading to substantial performance gains in visual question answering.

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

### [10] [Judge's Verdict: A Comprehensive Analysis of LLM Judge Capability Through Human Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09738)
*Steve Han,Gilberto Titericz Junior,Tom Balough,Wenfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Judge's Verdict Benchmark evaluates 54 LLMs for response accuracy evaluation using a two-step methodology that goes beyond correlation to analyze actual agreement patterns with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well LLMs can replicate human judgment when scoring responses from RAG or Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers, moving beyond traditional correlation metrics.

Method: Two-step methodology: (1) correlation test to filter judges with strong alignment, (2) human-likeness test using z-scores to identify human-like judgment (|z| < 1) and super-consistent judgment (z > 1) patterns.

Result: 27 out of 54 LLMs achieved Tier 1 performance: 23 models showed human-like patterns preserving human judgment nuances, while 4 demonstrated super-consistent behavior. Judge excellence depends on specific training strategies rather than just model size.

Conclusion: Correlation alone is insufficient for judge evaluation; a "Turing Test for judges" based on agreement patterns is needed, providing a standardized benchmark for classifying LLM judges into performance tiers.

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

### [11] [Gold Panning: Turning Positional Bias into Signal for Multi-Document LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09770)
*Adam Byerly,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gold Panning Bandits framework leverages LLM position bias to efficiently identify relevant documents by strategically reordering them and observing response shifts, reducing computational costs by up to 65% compared to random permutations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit strong position bias in multi-document contexts, prioritizing information based on location rather than relevance. Existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated, but the authors propose leveraging it as a diagnostic signal.

Method: Frame document reordering as a bipartite matching problem. Use a greedy O(N log N) strategy that prioritizes placing the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions, achieving comparable performance to the optimal O(N^3) Hungarian algorithm.

Result: The approach identifies relevant documents using up to 65% fewer language model queries than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining.

Conclusion: Inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into assets for efficient, inference-time optimization, demonstrating that position bias can be productively leveraged rather than merely mitigated.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

### [12] [PromptGuard at BLP-2025 Task 1: A Few-Shot Classification Framework Using Majority Voting and Keyword Similarity for Bengali Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09771)
*Rakib Hossan,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptGuard is a few-shot framework for Bengali hate speech classification that uses chi-square statistical analysis for keyword extraction and adaptive majority voting, achieving 67.61 micro-F1 score and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised approaches require extensive labeled datasets which are expensive for low-resource languages like Bengali, necessitating few-shot methods.

Method: Combines chi-square statistical analysis for keyword extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making, comparing statistical vs random keyword selection and adaptive voting mechanisms.

Result: Achieves micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines (60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Chi-square keywords provide consistent improvements across categories.

Conclusion: Chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all categories, and adaptive voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

### [13] [Steering Embedding Models with Geometric Rotation: Mapping Semantic Relationships Across Languages and Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09790)
*Michael Freenor,Lauren Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RISE is a geometric method that represents semantic transformations as rotational operations in embedding space, showing consistent cross-lingual and cross-model performance for discourse-level semantic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern high-dimensional text embeddings lack interpretable geometric properties unlike early word embeddings, making it difficult to understand how semantic relationships are encoded.

Method: Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE) represents semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding space, leveraging the manifold structure of language representations.

Result: RISE consistently maps discourse-level semantic transformations (negation, conditionality) across 3 embedding models, 3 datasets, and 7 diverse languages in 5 language groups with high transfer performance.

Conclusion: Discourse-level semantic transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis at sentence level.

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word
embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' +
''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

TL;DR: NG-Router is a novel multi-agent framework for nutrition QA that uses knowledge-graph-guided agent collaboration with graph neural networks for routing and gradient-based subgraph retrieval to handle contextual overload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of single-agent systems and complex multi-agent architectures in nutrition QA, while solving contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making for personalized dietary guidance.

Method: Formulates nutritional QA as supervised knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent collaboration, integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous knowledge graphs, uses GNN for task-aware routing distributions, and employs gradient-based subgraph retrieval for salient evidence identification.

Result: Extensive experiments show NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and ensemble baselines across multiple benchmarks and backbone models.

Conclusion: NG-Router offers a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks, advancing personalized dietary guidance.

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

### [16] [NarraBench: A Comprehensive Framework for Narrative Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09869)
*Sil Hamilton,Matthew Wilkens,Andrew Piper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NarraBench introduces a taxonomy of narrative-understanding tasks and surveys 78 existing benchmarks, finding that only 27% of narrative tasks are well covered and identifying significant gaps in evaluating aspects like events, style, perspective, and revelation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to systematically evaluate narrative understanding in NLP, as current benchmarks inadequately cover many important aspects of narrative comprehension.

Method: Developed a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding tasks and conducted a comprehensive survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.

Result: Found that only 27% of narrative tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, with significant gaps in evaluating narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation. Also identified need for benchmarks assessing subjective and perspectival aspects.

Conclusion: The taxonomy, survey, and methodology provide valuable resources for NLP researchers to better test LLM narrative understanding and address current evaluation gaps.

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

### [17] [CoBia: Constructed Conversations Can Trigger Otherwise Concealed Societal Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09871)
*Nafiseh Nikeghbal,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Jana Diesner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBia introduces lightweight adversarial attacks to systematically test when LLMs reveal harmful biases in conversations, showing that purposefully constructed dialogues reliably expose bias amplification and LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior like racist viewpoints despite safety measures, requiring systematic analysis of conditions under which they depart from ethical behavior.

Method: CoBia creates constructed conversations where models utter fabricated biased claims about social groups, then evaluates if models can recover and reject biased follow-up questions across 6 socio-demographic categories using established bias metrics.

Result: Purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification, and LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue, highlighting deeply embedded biases that can be surfaced through interaction.

Conclusion: Stress-testing through constructed conversations effectively exposes embedded biases in LLMs, demonstrating the need for more robust safety measures beyond standard checks.

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

### [18] [iBERT: Interpretable Style Embeddings via Sense Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09882)
*Vishal Anand,Milad Alshomary,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iBERT produces interpretable embeddings by representing tokens as sparse, non-negative mixtures over sense vectors, enabling modular control over style and semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create inherently interpretable and controllable embeddings that expose discriminative cues in language like stylistic and semantic structure, allowing modular control before downstream use.

Method: Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence embeddings or used at token level.

Result: Improves style representation effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT baselines on STEL benchmark while maintaining competitive authorship verification performance, with specific style attributes mapped to interpretable sense vectors.

Conclusion: iBERT provides structural modularity to interpretably decompose discriminative signals in data, enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and semantic factors, though not limited to style modeling.

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

### [19] [DELTA: Dynamic Layer-Aware Token Attention for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09883)
*Hossein Entezari Zarch,Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Murali Annavarm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA is a training-free sparse attention mechanism that reduces computational cost in large reasoning models by partitioning transformer layers into full attention, selection, and sparse attention groups, achieving up to 5x token reduction and 1.5x speedup while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from high inference costs due to full attention computation over growing sequences. Existing sparse attention methods cause accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative errors and dynamic token importance.

Method: Partitions transformer layers into three groups: initial full attention layers, selection layers that identify salient tokens using aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent sparse-attention layers that attend only to selected tokens while preserving full KV cache in memory.

Result: On reasoning benchmarks (AIME, GPQA-Diamond), DELTA matches or surpasses full attention accuracy while reducing attended tokens by up to 5x and achieving 1.5x end-to-end speedup.

Conclusion: Selective reuse of intermediate attention maps provides a robust path toward efficient long-context reasoning without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

### [20] [Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09885)
*Xu Pan,Ely Hahami,Jingxuan Fan,Ziqian Xie,Haim Sompolinsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Masked diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) outperform autoregressive LLMs (arLLMs) in knowledge injection via fine-tuning, being free from the reversal curse and requiring less data augmentation. A novel masked fine-tuning method for arLLMs is introduced to close this performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive LLMs struggle with knowledge injection due to issues like the reversal curse, while masked diffusion LLMs show promise in pre-training but their post-training capabilities are unknown.

Method: Fine-tuned arLLMs and dLLMs on three diverse datasets, evaluated with forward and backward QA to test knowledge generalization and reversal curse. Introduced a novel masked fine-tuning paradigm for arLLMs.

Result: dLLMs achieved high accuracy on both forward and backward QAs without paraphrases, while arLLMs required extensive data augmentation and struggled with mismatched information order. The proposed masked fine-tuning method significantly improved arLLM data efficiency.

Conclusion: dLLMs are superior for knowledge injection via fine-tuning, being reversal-curse-free and data-efficient. The novel masked fine-tuning method successfully bridges the performance gap for arLLMs.

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

### [21] [Abductive Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09887)
*Yijin Ni,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes abductive preference learning to address LLM overconfidence by learning preferences over prompts given responses, improving sensitivity to counterfactual prompts while maintaining standard preference optimization benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier LLMs remain overconfident despite RLHF/DPO alignment, failing to distinguish between prompts that should alter responses (e.g., same conservative answer to different food safety questions). This is attributed to preference learning focusing only on correct responses for given prompts while neglecting counterfactual prompts.

Method: Abductive preference learning - a fine-tuning paradigm that reverses conventional conditioning by learning preferences over prompts given a response. Implemented abductive DPO and DPOP variants, tested with multitask objectives combining standard and abductive methods.

Result: On abductive dataset: multitask DPOP boosted accuracy from 90.0% to 99.5% in response selection and 54.7% to 85.0% in prompt discrimination. On AlpacaEval: improved win rate from 5.26% to 6.17%. Qualitative evidence shows improved sensitivity to prompt differences.

Conclusion: Abductive preference learning addresses the overlooked challenge of counterfactual prompts while preserving conventional preference optimization benefits, with multitask objectives unifying response selection and prompt discrimination capabilities.

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

*Guanming Chen,Lingzhi Shen,Xiaohao Cai,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HIPPD is a brain-inspired framework for personality detection that uses hierarchical processing with LLM as cerebral cortex, dynamic memory module as prefrontal cortex, and specialized models as basal ganglia, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning approaches for personality detection struggle to capture contextual information across multiple posts and extract robust features in semantically sparse environments.

Method: Uses LLM as cerebral cortex for global semantic reasoning, dynamic memory module as prefrontal cortex for adaptive gating and selective retention, and specialized lightweight models as basal ganglia with winner-takes-all routing.

Result: Extensive experiments on Kaggle and Pandora datasets show HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The brain-inspired hierarchical framework effectively addresses limitations of existing personality detection methods by mimicking human brain processing.

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Shangbin Feng,Wenhao Yu,Yike Wang,Hongming Zhang,Yulia Tsvetkov,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Switch Generation enables model collaboration where pretrained and aligned models take turns generating response segments, guided by a switcher LM that learns to choose the best model for each segment based on query and context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment training has tradeoffs - it improves reasoning and instruction following but may reduce creativity and calibration. The goal is to combine strengths of both aligned and unaligned models through collaboration.

Method: Train a switcher LM that learns from outcomes of choosing different models to generate next segments. At inference, the switcher guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate segments where their strengths are most needed.

Result: Model collaboration consistently outperforms individual models on 16/18 tasks. Switch Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average, discovering compositional skills to solve problems where individual models struggle.

Conclusion: Switch Generation effectively reuses and repurposes by-products from expensive model training pipelines, generalizes to unseen models and tasks, and enables better performance through dynamic model collaboration.

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

*Sicong Huang,Qianqi Yan,Shengze Wang,Ian Lane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with span-level hallucination annotations improves abstractive summarization faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate fluent but sometimes unfaithful summaries with hallucinations at word, phrase, or concept level, and existing mitigation strategies fail to fully address diverse error types.

Method: Automatically generate summaries with various LLMs, use GPT-4o for span-level hallucination annotation, then fine-tune LLMs using three techniques: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation.

Result: All three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective method.

Conclusion: Span-level annotation-based fine-tuning effectively reduces hallucinations in LLM-generated summaries, with unlikelihood training showing superior performance.

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

*Weibin Cai,Jiayu Li,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHIELD is a hateful meme detection framework that identifies hate by analyzing presupposed context and false claims, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches focus on detection but don't address what makes memes hateful. Hateful memes are characterized by presupposed context and false claims that cause harm to society.

Method: Developed PCM for modeling contextual information across modalities and FACT module to detect false claims using external knowledge and cross-modal reference graphs. Combined them into SHIELD framework.

Result: SHIELD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, and shows versatility on other tasks like fake news detection.

Conclusion: SHIELD effectively captures the fundamental nature of hate in memes by addressing both presupposed context and false claims, providing superior detection performance.

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Sawsan Alqahtani,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Tasnim Mohiuddin,M Saiful Bari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tokenization evaluation in LLMs needs better metrics beyond fertility. Proposed STRR measures single-token word preservation, revealing English prioritization and cross-lingual fairness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tokenization evaluation relies on fertility metric which only measures compression efficiency but fails to reveal how vocabularies are allocated across languages and domains, obscuring cross-lingual fairness.

Method: Analyzed six widely used tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, then proposed Single Token Retention Rate (STRR) to measure proportion of words preserved as single tokens.

Result: Found stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, little domain sensitivity. STRR revealed systematic prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi.

Conclusion: STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers, offering interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness.

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework for deliberative tree search in LLMs, resolving ambiguity around reward signals and establishing formal distinctions between transient search guidance and durable parametric reward modeling for self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of deliberative tree search in LLMs is fragmented and lacks common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous role of reward signals - whether they serve as transient heuristics or durable learning targets.

Method: Introduces a unified framework that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: Search Mechanism, Reward Formulation, and Transition Function. Establishes formal distinction between transient Search Guidance for Test-Time Scaling and durable Parametric Reward Modeling for Self-Improvement.

Result: Developed a component-centric taxonomy, synthesized state-of-the-art approaches, and created a research roadmap for systematic progress in autonomous, self-improving agents.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified formalism to resolve ambiguity in reward signals and enables more systematic advancement in creating self-improving LLM agents through clear distinctions between transient and durable reward usage.

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding public perception and reliance on imperfect MT is crucial for contextualizing MT research in real-world applications as MT becomes increasingly commonplace.

Method: Human study conducted in a public museum with 452 participants, investigating how fluency and adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during casual use.

Result: Non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT due to lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance.

Conclusion: MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques should promote not only MT quality but also MT literacy among users to address over-reliance issues.

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

### [29] [MTP-S2UT: Enhancing Speech-to-Speech Translation Quality with Multi-token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10003)
*Jianjin Wang,Runsong Zhao,Xiaoqian Liu,Yuan Ge,Ziqiang Xu,Tong Xiao,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing multi-token prediction (MTP) loss to speech-to-unit translation models improves semantic density by predicting multiple tokens at each position, with early application in intermediate layers (MTP-S2UT) yielding the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-to-speech translation methods use single speech tokens that lack semantic density, requiring multiple tokens to express complete semantic units, which limits efficiency and representation quality.

Method: Proposed multi-token prediction (MTP) loss applied to speech-to-unit translation models, with an advanced variant (MTP-S2UT) that applies MTP loss to intermediate hidden representations where CTC loss is computed for earlier information enrichment.

Result: All MTP loss variants consistently improve S2UT translation quality, with the proposed MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance by enabling earlier and more effective enhancement of hidden representations.

Conclusion: Multi-token prediction loss effectively enhances semantic density in speech-to-speech translation, and applying it early in intermediate layers (MTP-S2UT) provides superior performance compared to final-layer application.

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ
speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExpandSearch trains a 3B LLM search agent with query expansion capability through reinforcement learning, assisted by a pre-trained squeezer model for document understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-augmented search agents have limited reasoning and search capabilities, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks that require handling complex or compound queries.

Method: Train an LLM-based search agent with query expansion through reinforcement learning, where the agent proposes multiple query variants per turn. Incorporate a pre-trained squeezer model to help understand retrieved documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high retrieval recall.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-hop QA benchmarks with an average improvement of 4.4% compared to baselines. Strong gains on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation, demonstrating that even a small 3B LLM can achieve strong query expansion capability.

Conclusion: The proposed ExpandSearch method with query expansion and squeezer model assistance enables effective multi-hop QA, showing that specialized components can compensate for model scale limitations while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

*Yuyi Huang,Runzhe Zhan,Lidia S. Chao,Ailin Tao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Long-CoT models can drift from aligned paths during reasoning, leading to unsafe content. The paper identifies triggers of Path Drift and proposes both attack and defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability in Long-CoT prompting where reasoning trajectories can drift from safety-aligned paths despite existing alignment techniques like RLHF.

Method: Empirical analysis identifying three behavioral triggers of Path Drift, followed by development of a three-stage Path Drift Induction Framework and a path-level defense strategy with role attribution correction and metacognitive reflection.

Result: The three behavioral triggers (first-person commitments, ethical evaporation, condition chain escalation) were identified, and the attack framework successfully reduced refusal rates, while the defense strategy provided mitigation.

Conclusion: Path Drift is a significant vulnerability in long-form reasoning that requires trajectory-level alignment oversight beyond token-level alignment to ensure safety in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

*Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang,Su Liu,Xin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compact encoders like DistilBERT with cross-entropy loss achieve competitive performance for medical abstract classification while being more efficient than larger models like BERT base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are difficult to deploy in healthcare settings due to strict cost, latency, and privacy constraints, necessitating exploration of lightweight alternatives.

Method: Fine-tuned BERT base and DistilBERT on medical abstracts using three loss functions: standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross-entropy, and focal loss, while keeping other hyperparameters fixed.

Result: DistilBERT with plain cross-entropy achieved the best balance of performance on test set while using significantly fewer parameters than BERT base.

Conclusion: Practical default approach: start with compact encoders and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before considering heavier models.

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

*Adnan El Assadi,Isaac Chung,Roman Solomatin,Niklas Muennighoff,Kenneth Enevoldsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HUME is a human evaluation framework for text embeddings that measures human performance across 16 MTEB datasets, revealing humans achieve 77.6% average performance vs 80.1% for best models, with substantial variation across tasks and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide reliable human performance baselines for text embedding evaluation, as current frameworks like MTEB lack human performance estimates, limiting interpretability of model scores.

Method: Developed HUME framework to measure human performance across 16 MTEB datasets covering reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity tasks across diverse high- and low-resource languages.

Result: Humans achieved 77.6% average performance compared to 80.1% for best embedding models, with significant variation - models reach near-ceiling performance on some datasets but struggle on others, revealing dataset issues and shortcomings in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: HUME provides human performance baselines, insights into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible framework that enables more meaningful model interpretation and informs development of both models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,

*Yibo Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLMN is a neural-symbolic framework that combines continuous concept embeddings with fuzzy-logic reasoning to maintain both high performance and interpretability in NLP, outperforming existing concept-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept bottleneck models in NLP either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they fail to model dynamic concept interactions like negation and context.

Method: CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules. It augments text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules.

Result: Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality.

Conclusion: Integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

*Hua Cai,Shuang Zhao,Liang Zhang,Xuli Shen,Qing Xu,Weilin Shen,Zihao Wen,Tianke Ban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unilaw-R1 is a 7B-parameter LLM for legal reasoning that addresses legal knowledge gaps, unreliable reasoning, and weak business generalization through a two-stage training approach using curated CoT data and achieves competitive performance against larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-focused LLMs are evolving rapidly but their capabilities in handling complex legal problems remain underexplored, with challenges including insufficient legal knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization.

Method: Constructed Unilaw-R1-Data (17K distilled CoT samples), used two-stage training combining Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning, and created Unilaw-R1-Eval benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms all models of similar scale, achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%), and shows significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct by 6.6% average margin.

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1 demonstrates that lightweight 7B-parameter models can effectively handle complex legal reasoning tasks with proper training strategies and curated data, reducing deployment costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

### [36] [A-IPO: Adaptive Intent-driven Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10077)
*Wenqing Wang,Muhammad Asif Ali,Ali Shoker,Ruohan Yang,Junyang Chen,Ying Sha,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A-IPO is a new alignment method that infers latent user intent from prompts and incorporates it into reward functions, enabling better handling of diverse preferences and improving adversarial robustness compared to DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods like DPO default to majority views, overlooking minority opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts, which limits their ability to handle diverse and dynamic human preferences.

Method: A-IPO introduces an intention module that infers latent intent behind user prompts and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward function, using an intention-response similarity term to increase preference margin and improve alignment.

Result: A-IPO achieves substantial improvements: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

Conclusion: A-IPO facilitates pluralistic preference optimization while enhancing adversarial robustness, consistently outperforming existing baselines by explicitly modeling diverse user intents and improving alignment with underlying user intentions.

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

*Parthiv Chatterjee,Shivam Sonawane,Amey Hengle,Aditya Tanna,Sourish Dasgupta,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerAugy is a data augmentation technique that improves personalized document summarization by enhancing dataset diversity through cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation, leading to significant performance gains in user-encoder accuracy and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized summarization is challenging due to scarce training data containing both user preference history and target summaries, and limited topic-transition diversity in existing datasets like MS/CAS PENS.

Method: Proposed PerAugy - a novel data augmentation technique using cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation to enhance dataset diversity for training personalized summarization models.

Result: PerAugy significantly boosts accuracy of four SOTA user-encoders (best: 0.132↑ AUC) and increases personalization in two SOTA summarizer frameworks (avg. 61.2%↑ PSE-SU4). Dataset diversity metrics TP and DegreeD strongly correlate with performance gains.

Conclusion: Increased dataset diversity through PerAugy's augmentation is a key factor driving performance improvements in personalized summarization systems, with strong correlation between diversity metrics and user-encoder performance.

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

TL;DR: REFRAIN is a training-free framework that adaptively stops Chain-of-Thought reasoning to prevent overthinking, reducing token usage by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves LLM performance but can lead to overthinking - excessive or redundant reasoning that increases costs and leads to incorrect conclusions.

Method: Uses a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds based on problem difficulty.

Result: Across four benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT prompting.

Conclusion: When-to-stop reasoning is a practical axis of test-time scaling that enables models to reason just enough rather than more.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LinearRAG is an efficient graph-based RAG framework that constructs relation-free hierarchical graphs using lightweight entity extraction, enabling linear scaling and precise retrieval without costly relation extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems struggle with fragmented information in large corpora, while existing GraphRAG methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction that produces noisy graphs degrading retrieval quality.

Method: LinearRAG constructs a Tri-Graph using only entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding relation modeling. It uses two-stage retrieval: entity activation via semantic bridging followed by passage retrieval through importance aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets show LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models in retrieval performance.

Conclusion: LinearRAG provides an economical and reliable alternative to traditional GraphRAG by eliminating unstable relation extraction while maintaining effective retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

TL;DR: A framework combining OCR engines and LLMs for efficient information extraction from copy-heavy documents, achieving near-perfect accuracy with sub-second processing speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of extracting information from copy-heavy documents with structurally similar content, which is critical for enterprise document processing but understudied.

Method: Systematic framework combining OCR engines with LLMs using intelligent strategy selection across three extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, table-based) and adaptive format-aware routing.

Result: Outstanding performance: F1=1.0 accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, F1=0.997 accuracy with 0.6s for image inputs using PaddleOCR, achieving 54x performance improvement over naive approaches.

Conclusion: The repetitive nature of copy-heavy tasks can be transformed from computational burden into optimization opportunity through structure-aware method selection, establishing a general principle for document processing.

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffHeads is a lightweight debiasing framework that identifies and masks bias-inducing attention heads in LLMs, reducing unfairness by 49.4% under Direct-Answer prompting and 40.3% under Chain-of-Thought prompting without harming model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly mediate decisions in sensitive domains where unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing bias mitigation approaches are largely fragile and lack insight into the underlying mechanisms that generate biased outputs.

Method: 1) Compare Direct-Answer (DA) vs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across 8 LLMs; 2) Define token-to-head contribution score to trace bias to specific attention heads; 3) Develop DiffHeads framework that identifies bias heads through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, then selectively masks only those heads.

Result: DA prompting increases unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% compared to CoT. A small cluster of bias heads activate under DA but stay dormant with CoT. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4% under DA and 40.3% under CoT while preserving model utility.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence, demonstrating that selective masking of identified bias heads through DiffHeads effectively reduces unfairness without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

TL;DR: BILLY is a training-free framework that blends multiple persona vectors in a single LLM's activation space to achieve multi-perspective creativity benefits of multi-LLM systems while reducing computational costs and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-LLM systems enhance creativity through collective intelligence but suffer from high computational costs and inference latency. There's a need to capture multi-LLM collaboration benefits within a single model.

Method: Extract and blend multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space, then steer generation with this merged vector during inference to enable multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication.

Result: BILLY surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches in creativity benchmarks while substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Persona vector blending enables effective control over complementary generation aspects and greater interpretability.

Conclusion: BILLY successfully captures multi-LLM collaboration benefits within a single model, providing enhanced creativity with reduced computational overhead through persona vector blending in activation space.

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater

TL;DR: This survey systematically investigates provenance tracking for LLM-generated content across four dimensions: model sourcing, model structure sourcing, training data sourcing, and external data sourcing, proposing a dual-paradigm taxonomy of prior-based and posterior-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs shift from objective tasks to subjective decision-making, their black-box nature and human-like outputs create significant risks including hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright infringement, making multi-perspective information sourcing essential for trustworthy deployment.

Method: Organizes provenance tracking around four interrelated dimensions: model-centric (model sourcing, model structure sourcing) and data-centric (training data sourcing, external data sourcing), with a dual-paradigm taxonomy classifying methods as prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) or posterior-based (retrospective inference).

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing provenance tracking mechanisms that enhance transparency and accountability in LLM-generated content.

Conclusion: Traceability across these dimensions significantly improves the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications, addressing critical risks associated with their deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning in large language models, covering methods for improvement, current benchmarks, and analysis of inductive ability sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inductive reasoning is a fundamental type of reasoning characterized by particular-to-general thinking and non-unique answers. It's crucial for knowledge generalization and aligns with human cognition, but lacks systematic summary despite increasing research interest.

Method: The survey categorizes methods for improving inductive reasoning into three areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. It summarizes current benchmarks and proposes a unified sandbox-based evaluation approach with observation coverage metric.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive framework for understanding inductive reasoning in LLMs, including categorization of improvement methods and a unified evaluation approach.

Conclusion: The survey establishes a solid foundation for future research by analyzing sources of inductive ability and how simple model architectures and data can help with inductive tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals critical failure modes in LLM-based multi-agent medical consultation systems, showing that high accuracy alone is insufficient and transparent reasoning processes are essential for trustworthy medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLM-based multi-agent medical systems focuses only on final-answer accuracy, treating their collaborative processes as opaque black boxes, which poses significant risks in high-stakes medical applications.

Method: Large-scale empirical study of 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and six multi-agent frameworks, using mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with quantitative auditing to develop taxonomy of collaborative failure modes.

Result: Quantitative audit revealed four dominant failure patterns: flawed consensus from shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis.

Conclusion: High accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical trust; transparent and auditable reasoning processes are crucial for responsible development and deployment of medical AI systems.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

*Bo Yuan,Yulin Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Delora is a PEFT framework that decouples sample selection from model training to handle noisy labels in LLM fine-tuning by using clean and noisy LoRA modules as a learnable threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world training data often contains noisy labels, and existing methods that select samples based on loss can create a vicious cycle where inaccurate initial selection leads to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduces clean and noisy LoRA modules that leverage the memory effect - clean LoRA memorizes clean data while noisy LoRA memorizes mislabeled data, serving as a learnable threshold for sample selection. This decouples selection from training.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets show Delora is effective in noisy label detection and text classification tasks.

Conclusion: Delora successfully breaks the vicious cycle in noisy label learning by decoupling sample selection from model training, demonstrating improved performance in handling noisy labeled data.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SyTTA is a label-free test-time adaptation framework that uses input perplexity and output predictive entropy to adapt LLMs to domain shifts without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face distribution shifts in specialized domains but domain-specific fine-tuning requires expensive labeled data, which is scarce in expertise-limited settings.

Method: SyTTA couples input-side perplexity (domain terminology mismatch) and output-side predictive entropy (unstable token probabilities) for on-the-fly adaptation without supervision.

Result: SyTTA delivers consistent gains across diverse models and domains, improving Rouge-LSum by over 120% on agricultural QA with Qwen-2.5-7B using only 4 extra tokens per query.

Conclusion: Effective test-time adaptation for LLMs is achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Text2Token is an unsupervised generative framework for text representation learning that uses token target prediction with carefully constructed target distributions, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the connection between representation space and vocabulary space for unsupervised text representation learning, inspired by findings that high-quality representations align with key tokens in input text.

Method: Proposes token target prediction task using two methods to construct target token distributions: data-driven (meaningful tokens in text) and model-derived (semantically derived tokens beyond text) approaches.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive learning method LLM2Vec on MTEB v2 benchmark, showing vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together during training.

Conclusion: Provides a new generative framework for unsupervised text representation learning and insights about joint optimization of vocabulary and representation spaces, offering new directions for future work.

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

TL;DR: ImCoref-CeS is a novel framework that combines enhanced supervised neural methods with LLM reasoning for coreference resolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dilemma between supervised neural methods and LLMs in coreference resolution, and effectively combine their strengths which remains underexplored.

Method: Proposes ImCoref-CeS framework with: 1) ImCoref - improved supervised method with lightweight bridging module for long-text encoding, biaffine scorer for positional information, and hybrid mention regularization; 2) LLM as multi-role Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions and coreference results.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ImCoref-CeS framework successfully integrates supervised neural methods with LLM reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance in coreference resolution.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: AoU is a framework that constrains LLM inference to validated premises through decomposition, auditing, and conditioned inference to reduce reasoning-induced hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate reasoning traces that appear coherent but rely on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated conclusions, which prior work fails to adequately address.

Method: Three-phase framework: (1) decomposing queries into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on validated premises using posterior-constrained inference.

Result: Significant improvements: +30% on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and +20-28% on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding baselines.

Conclusion: AoU effectively reduces reasoning-induced hallucinations in LLMs through premise validation, with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

TL;DR: A defense framework called \ourmethod that protects large language models from backdoor attacks without requiring prior knowledge of trigger settings, using backdoor aggregation in representation space and recovery fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks pose significant threats to LLMs through public checkpoints, and existing defenses rely on impractical assumptions about trigger settings that limit their real-world applicability.

Method: Two-stage process: (1) aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers into compromised models, (2) performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs while maintaining model utility.

Result: Reduces average Attack Success Rate to 4.41% across multiple benchmarks (28.1%~69.3% improvement over baselines), preserves clean accuracy within 0.5% of original model, and generalizes across different backdoor types.

Conclusion: \ourmethod provides an effective and practical defense against backdoor attacks in LLMs without trigger knowledge requirements, demonstrating robustness across various deployment scenarios while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)
\ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$.
(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original
model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense
generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper investigates crosslingual consistency in multilingual LLMs, attributing factual inconsistencies to entity alignment failures and proposing methods to improve alignment through English subject translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multilingual LLMs fail to maintain consistent factual knowledge across languages and identify entity alignment as a key factor.

Method: Assessed entity alignment through translation tasks, then proposed SubSub and SubInj methods that integrate English translations of subjects into multilingual prompts.

Result: Found strong correlation between alignment and consistency, with proposed methods substantially improving both factual recall accuracy and crosslingual consistency.

Conclusion: Entity alignment is crucial for crosslingual consistency, and interventions that reinforce alignment through pivot-language processing offer practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling approaches like DeepConf incur substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results, creating a need for more efficient methods.

Method: Recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in reasoning, verification, and summarization to enhance solution retention and reduce Pass@k vs Pass@1 disparity.

Result: Achieves 99.79 score on AIME2025 using only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf, with comprehensive validation across multiple models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method offers new insights for designing efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language models.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups, given that emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts.

Method: Proposed a framework analyzing cognitive and affective empathy across 315 unique personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes (age, culture, gender) across four LLMs, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: Attributes profoundly shape empathetic responses, with multiple attributes sometimes attenuating or reversing expected empathy patterns. Models broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends but show notable misalignments for certain groups like Confucian culture.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Motivation: To explore a combined architecture that can perform both Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation simultaneously using pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models.

Method: Combined end-to-end architecture integrating pre-trained speech encoders with Large Language Models for simultaneous ASR and ST tasks.

Result: Best model achieves better translation results than SeamlessM4T and matches performance of cascaded Whisper+NLLB system, with up to 8% gain in COMET-DA22 metric for English-to-German translation.

Conclusion: The proposed combined end-to-end architecture with pre-trained components is effective for simultaneous ASR and ST tasks, outperforming large foundational models and matching cascaded systems.

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves
converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in
another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the
traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a
combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large
Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair
show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than
SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model,
but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB,
with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of scalable and systematic tools for measuring argument structure constructions (ASCs) usage in second language proficiency analysis, despite ASCs being a theoretically grounded framework.

Method: Developed a publicly available Python package called ASC analyzer that automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices capturing diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. Conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine relationships between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

Result: The ASC analyzer provides automated analysis of argument structure constructions and generates comprehensive indices for L2 writing assessment.

Conclusion: The ASC analyzer addresses the gap in scalable tools for ASC analysis and demonstrates utility through empirical analysis of relationships between ASC-based indices and L2 writing proficiency scores.

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens
for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic
tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC
analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The
analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture
diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To
demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses
that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

*Aashiq Muhamed,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Markus Dreyer,Virginia Smith,Mona T. Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale study reveals language models struggle with selective refusal in RAG systems, with refusal accuracy below 50% on multi-document tasks. Introduces RefusalBench framework for dynamic evaluation using linguistic perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models in RAG systems have significant failure points in selectively refusing to answer based on flawed context, which is critical for safety. Static benchmarks are unreliable as models exploit artifacts and memorize test instances.

Method: Introduces RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic test cases through 176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluates over 30 models.

Result: Reveals systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and categorization skills, neither scale nor extended reasoning improves performance. Models exhibit either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution.

Conclusion: Selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability offering clear path for improvement. Releases two benchmarks (RefusalBench-NQ and RefusalBench-GaRAGe) and generation framework for continued dynamic evaluation.

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssoMem is a novel framework that constructs associative memory graphs for better memory recall in QA tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely mainly on semantic distance for retrieval, which struggles in similarity-dense scenarios. The paper is inspired by how humans link information associatively.

Method: Proposes AssoMem framework that constructs associative memory graphs anchoring dialogue utterances to automatically extracted clues, with multi-dimensional retrieval signals (relevance, importance, temporal alignment) fused using adaptive mutual information strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and new MeetingQA dataset show AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: AssoMem demonstrates superiority in context-aware memory recall through its associative memory graph approach.

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an
associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically
extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,
and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion
strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

### [60] [STEAM: A Semantic-Level Knowledge Editing Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10398)
*Geunyeong Jeong,Juoh Sun,Seonghee Lee,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STEAM is a semantic-level knowledge editing framework that improves integration of updated knowledge into LLMs' knowledge structure by aligning edited facts with semantic anchors in the latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing methods focus on token-level likelihood optimization but create isolated residual streams that bypass natural reasoning processes, lacking semantic coherence.

Method: STEAM identifies target representations as semantic anchors for updated facts, then guides internal representations toward these anchors through alignment loss during optimization.

Result: Experimental results show STEAM improves models' reasoning ability with edited knowledge and enhances semantic coherence compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Latent-space alignment is crucial for reliable and coherent knowledge editing, enabling better integration of updated knowledge into LLMs' knowledge structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

*Federica Bologna,Tiffany Pan,Matthew Wilkens,Yue Guo,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongQAEval is an evaluation framework for clinical QA systems that compares coarse vs fine-grained annotation methods across correctness, relevance, and safety dimensions, finding optimal approaches for each dimension and showing that partial sentence annotation can achieve comparable reliability to full annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating long-form clinical QA systems is challenging due to the need for medical expertise and difficulty achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text, especially in resource-limited settings.

Method: Developed LongQAEval framework based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by physicians and LLMs, comparing coarse answer-level versus fine-grained sentence-level evaluation across correctness, relevance, and safety dimensions.

Result: Inter-annotator agreement varies by dimension: fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves agreement on relevance, and safety judgments remain inconsistent. Annotating only a small subset of sentences provides reliability comparable to coarse annotations.

Conclusion: LongQAEval provides practical evaluation recommendations for clinical QA systems, showing dimension-specific annotation strategies and that partial sentence annotation can reduce cost while maintaining reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

### [62] [Do Audio LLMs Really LISTEN, or Just Transcribe? Measuring Lexical vs. Acoustic Emotion Cues Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10444)
*Jingyi Chen,Zhimeng Guo,Jiyun Chun,Pichao Wang,Andrew Perrault,Micha Elsner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN benchmark reveals that large audio language models (LALMs) primarily rely on lexical content rather than acoustic cues for emotion understanding, showing limited ability to process acoustic information when lexical cues are neutral or conflicting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large audio language models genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical content for emotion understanding from speech.

Method: Developed LISTEN benchmark to disentangle lexical reliance from acoustic sensitivity through controlled tests including neutral lexical cues, cue alignment scenarios, and cue conflict situations.

Result: Models consistently showed lexical dominance - predicting 'neutral' when lexical cues were neutral, limited gains with aligned cues, failure to classify emotions under cue conflict, and chance-level performance in paralinguistic settings.

Conclusion: Current LALMs largely 'transcribe' rather than 'listen,' heavily relying on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN provides a framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECON introduces a summarization module within RAG systems to compress retrieved documents, reducing context length by 35% while improving performance on QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficient context management in RAG systems where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.

Method: Integrates explicit summarization module trained via two-stage process: relevance pretraining on QA datasets followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs for factuality and clarity.

Result: Reduces total context length by 35%, improves training speed and inference latency, boosts EM scores (14.5% for 3B model, 3.0% for 7B model), particularly strong in multi-hop QA.

Conclusion: Learned context compression is essential for building practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is

*Utsav Maskey,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes safety-induced over-refusals in LLMs during RAG, introduces RagRefuse benchmark, and proposes SafeRAG-Steering to reduce false refusals while maintaining legitimate safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment in LLMs causes over-refusals where benign requests are declined due to aggressive filters, particularly problematic in RAG systems where context influences refusal behavior.

Method: Constructed RagRefuse benchmark with domain-stratified benign/harmful queries and controlled context contamination. Proposed SafeRAG-Steering - an embedding intervention that steers outputs toward safe, non-refusing regions.

Result: Analysis shows context arrangement, domain, and harmful-text density trigger refusals on benign queries. SafeRAG-Steering reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG while preserving legitimate refusals.

Conclusion: Model-specific alignment choices affect refusal behavior. SafeRAG-Steering effectively mitigates over-refusals in RAG systems without compromising safety.

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

*Peng Fan,Wenping Wang,Fei Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses speech-text length mismatch in ASR by proposing Time Independence Loss and Aligned Cross Entropy Loss for better alignment, achieving 86% frame reduction while outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CTC methods fail to properly align speech and text when downsampling speech to text-similar length, creating challenges in automatic speech recognition.

Method: Proposed two alignment methods: Time Independence Loss (TIL) and Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss based on edit distance, with frame fusion using weighted summation of keyframes and context frames.

Result: Experimental results on AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 datasets show the proposed methods outperform previous work and achieve at least 86% reduction in frame count.

Conclusion: The introduced alignment methods effectively solve speech-text length mismatch in ASR, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

TL;DR: EssenceBench is a coarse-to-fine framework that uses iterative Genetic Algorithm to compress benchmarks by eliminating redundant samples while maintaining model ranking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As benchmark suites grow significantly in scale, there's a need for systematic framework that integrates redundancy reduction and performance prediction to ensure both accuracy and ranking consistency.

Method: Performs sample-level analysis of benchmark redundancy, frames benchmark compression as optimization problem with score reconstruction, and uses iterative Genetic Algorithm combining fitness-based subset search and attribution-based sample search.

Result: Achieves superior compression with lower reconstruction error and higher efficiency. On HellaSwag benchmark (10K samples), preserves all model rankings within 5% using 25x fewer samples, and 95% ranking preservation within 5% using 200x fewer samples.

Conclusion: EssenceBench provides an effective framework for benchmark compression that maintains ranking consistency while significantly reducing sample size.

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the digital divide faced by individuals with lower academic literacy by creating an accessible communication framework that transcends traditional barriers.

Method: Combines neuro-symbolic AI using LLMs with symbolic knowledge from Natural Semantic Metalanguage theory to decompose complex ideas into atomic concepts. Involved 200+ semi-literate participants in human-centric collaborative design and validation.

Result: Achieved over 80% semantic comprehensibility, demonstrated accessible learning curve, and showed universal adaptability for underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Conclusion: The proposed ideographic metalanguage system effectively serves underprivileged populations by providing an accessible communication framework that overcomes academic, linguistic, and cultural barriers.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

TL;DR: FML-bench is a new benchmark for evaluating automatic machine learning research agents that addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by focusing on fundamental ML problems, offering high task diversity, and reducing coding burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for ML research agents overemphasize engineering aspects and application-oriented tasks while neglecting fundamental research problems and academic rigor, making it difficult to properly assess agents' scientific capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce FML-bench with 8 diverse fundamental ML research problems, a unified evaluation framework with five complementary metrics, and evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on this benchmark.

Result: Evaluation shows that agents using broad research exploration strategies outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration, suggesting breadth of exploration leads to more effective research outcomes than incremental refinement.

Conclusion: FML-bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for ML research agents that emphasizes fundamental problems and diverse tasks, revealing that broad exploration strategies are more effective than narrow deep exploration for research automation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark

TL;DR: The study uses LDA modeling on TED Talks to show that timing and temporal dynamics are stronger drivers of audience engagement than thematic content, challenging the assumption that content features primarily drive popularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what drives popularity in digital services, particularly examining the mismatch between what creators think audiences want versus actual audience preferences, using TED Talks as a case study.

Method: Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, comparing thematic supply from creators with audience engagement demand, and conducting longitudinal analysis of temporal dynamics.

Result: Identified persistent mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences, and found that temporal dynamics exert stronger influence on engagement than thematic content.

Conclusion: Timing and contextual factors matter more than content features for audience engagement, providing new insights for digital platforms and practical implications for marketers and content creators.

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers
of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in
shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer
attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for
marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience
engagement strategies.

TL;DR: The paper presents a medical order extraction system using LLaMA-4 17B with few-shot learning, achieving 5th place in MEDIQA-OE 2025 with 37.76 F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical order extraction is crucial for structuring clinical information to support decision-making and workflow automation in healthcare settings.

Method: Used a general-purpose LLaMA-4 17B model with instruction tuning and single in-context example (few-shot learning) without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Ranked 5th among 17 teams with 105 submissions, achieving average F1 score of 37.76 with improved accuracy in reason and provenance extraction.

Conclusion: Large non-domain-specific LLMs with effective prompt engineering can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: The paper presents a case study on extending the context window of diffusion LLMs (LLaDA) to 128K tokens through post-training techniques, introducing UltraLLaDA which outperforms training-free baselines on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs show great potential but their long-context behavior remains largely unexplored. The authors aim to extend context windows without retraining from scratch.

Method: Simple modification to standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) to accommodate diffusion probabilistic modeling, plus comparison of masking strategies during post-training for optimization stability and long-range recall.

Result: UltraLLaDA achieves 128K-token context window and significantly outperforms training-free baselines on long-context tasks in empirical evaluation.

Conclusion: Special positional extension is key for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended contexts, providing practical guidance for efficient 128K-scale context via post-training.

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

TL;DR: VOLTAGE is a contrastive learning-based OCR methodology for low-resource languages that uses auto-glyph feature recommendation and data augmentation to achieve high accuracy on endangered scripts like Takri.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2500 languages are endangered, leading to loss of cultural heritage. Lack of unsupervised OCR methods for low-resource languages impedes their digital inclusion and increases extinction risk.

Method: Contrastive learning with auto-glyph feature recommendation for cluster-based labeling, augmented with image transformations and Generative Adversarial Networks for data diversity and volume.

Result: Achieved 95% accuracy for machine-printed and 87% for handwritten Takri script. Validated on multiple Indic scripts demonstrating universal applicability.

Conclusion: VOLTAGE successfully addresses OCR challenges for low-resource languages, enabling digital preservation of endangered scripts and cultural heritage.

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high

accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

TL;DR: AdvPrompt uses black-box adversarial prompting to reduce token usage in large reasoning models while maintaining accuracy, achieving significant token reductions across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models incur substantial computational and latency overheads due to lengthy reasoning processes, hindering practical deployment.

Method: AdvPrompt is an iterative refinement framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse perspectives to elicit concise responses from both open-source and closed-source models.

Result: Achieved 3x reduction in response length on GSM8K for Qwen3, ~40% average token reduction across four benchmarks, and 35-47% token reduction on MATH-500 for Claude-3.7 and Gemini-2.5.

Conclusion: Black-box prompting is a practical and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency, with generalizability across various model scales and families.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

*Yujie Ren,Niklas Gruhlke,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AuthenHallu is the first hallucination detection benchmark built from authentic LLM-human dialogues, revealing 31.4% hallucination rate overall and 60.0% in challenging domains like Math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination benchmarks are artificially constructed and fail to capture real-world hallucination characteristics, limiting their practical utility in sensitive domains like medicine and law.

Method: Created AuthenHallu by selecting and annotating samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues, providing authentic data for evaluating hallucination detection.

Result: Found hallucinations in 31.4% of query-response pairs overall, with rate increasing to 60.0% in Math & Number Problems. Vanilla LLMs show promise as detectors but current performance remains insufficient for real-world use.

Conclusion: Authentic benchmarks like AuthenHallu are crucial for advancing hallucination detection research, and current LLM-based detectors need significant improvement to handle real-world scenarios effectively.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BitMar is a quantized multimodal transformer that uses 1.58-bit encoders and an episodic memory system to enable efficient image-text generation on edge devices with limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deploy multimodal vision-language models on edge devices despite their extensive, full-precision backbones that make deployment challenging, and to enhance utilization of past context through memory-augmented architectures with aggressive quantization.

Method: Uses 1.58-bit encoders (BitNet-style for text, DiNOv2-based for vision) to create compact embeddings, combines them to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory, applies per-layer conditioning during vector retrieval, and employs attention sinks with sliding-window mechanism for processing long inputs under tight memory budgets.

Result: Achieves competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency with small model footprint, delivering strong quality-speed trade-off suitable for edge deployment.

Conclusion: BitMar's combination of aggressive quantization, episodic memory, per-layer conditioning, and sliding-window attention makes it well-suited for edge deployment of multimodal transformers.

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

*Di Wu abd Shuaidong Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for dynamic topic evolution using temporal LLMs that captures topic changes over time through contextual embeddings, temporal decay, and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically model how topics evolve, expand, and decline over time in large-scale text data, addressing limitations in traditional static topic modeling approaches.

Method: Uses LLM contextual embeddings with temporal decay functions and attention mechanisms to adjust semantic importance by time intervals, then maps to latent topic space with state transition matrices for dynamic evolution modeling.

Result: Outperforms existing models across multiple metrics, effectively captures topic generation, expansion, and decline patterns in real-world corpora.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns, enriches topic modeling research, and supports complex text analysis across domains with improved coherence, diversity, and interpretability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

*Bowei He,Lihao Yin,Huiling Zhen,Shuqi Liu,Han Wu,Xiaokun Zhang,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how calibration data impacts LLM compression, finding that activation space representativeness and diversity determine calibration quality, and proposes a data curation framework to preserve critical LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically examine how calibration data affects different LLM capabilities after compression, particularly high-level reasoning skills like math and coding, which are under-explored in existing research.

Method: Analyzes calibration data impacts from activation pattern perspective, explores representativeness and diversity in activation space, and develops a calibration data curation framework based on findings.

Result: Found that activation space representativeness and diversity fundamentally determine calibration data quality, and the proposed framework enhances performance of existing compression methods in preserving critical LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Calibration data quality depends on activation space properties, and systematic curation can significantly improve compression outcomes for preserving complex reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Epistemic Appeal Identification - a new task to identify how factual claims are supported by external sources/evidence, and presents FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226 news sentences with detailed span-level annotations about sources and evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how factual claims are made credible by being anchored to external sources or evidence, going beyond simple claim detection and verification to analyze the nuanced epistemic structures supporting these claims.

Method: Created FactAppeal dataset with manual annotations of 3,226 English news sentences, including span-level annotations identifying factual statements, source mentions, source types, attribution methods, and other epistemic features. Tested various encoder and generative decoder models (2B-9B parameters).

Result: The best performing model (Gemma 2 9B) achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.73 for the Epistemic Appeal Identification task.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces a novel task and dataset for analyzing how factual claims are supported by evidence, demonstrating that large language models can effectively identify epistemic appeals in news text.

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes epistemic strategies in factual reporting by comparing CNN and Fox News, finding systematic differences in how they use facts and sources to construct reality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To computationally explore the epistemic strategies behind factual reporting, which remains underexplored despite extensive media bias research.

Method: Used article matching strategy to compare reports on same events, applied FactAppeal framework to 470K+ articles from COVID-19 pandemic and Israel-Hamas war periods.

Result: CNN contains more factual statements grounded in external sources, citing Experts and Expert Documents (appeal to formal authority), while Fox News favors News Reports and direct quotations.

Conclusion: Partisan outlets use systematically different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to media bias studies.

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AGENTIQL is an agent-inspired multi-expert framework for text-to-SQL that improves complex reasoning and schema diversity through modular question decomposition, sub-query generation, and refinement steps with parallel execution capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic LLM architectures struggle with complex reasoning tasks and diverse database schemas in text-to-SQL generation, requiring a more structured approach to handle these challenges effectively.

Method: Uses a multi-expert framework with reasoning agent for question decomposition, coding agent for sub-query generation, refinement step for column selection, and adaptive router to balance between modular pipeline and baseline parser. Supports parallel execution for scalability.

Result: Achieves 86.07% EX on Spider benchmark using 14B models with Planner&Executor merging strategy, narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX) while using smaller open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: AGENTIQL provides a robust, scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing that enhances both accuracy and transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering significant improvements over monolithic architectures.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BrowserAgent is an interactive web agent that uses human-inspired browser actions like scrolling, clicking, and typing to solve complex web tasks, achieving competitive results with less training data than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents like Search-R1 and WebDancer convert interactive web environments into static text, which doesn't match human browsing behaviors involving diverse browser interactions.

Method: BrowserAgent operates directly on raw web pages via Playwright using predefined browser actions, with two-stage training (SFT and RFT) and an explicit memory mechanism for storing key conclusions across steps.

Result: BrowserAgent-7B achieves around 20% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, despite using significantly less training data.

Conclusion: BrowserAgent serves as a more advanced framework for interactive and scalable web agents by mimicking human browsing behaviors.

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on

TL;DR: RePro is a web recycling method that trains a small LM with reinforcement learning to generate high-quality rephrasings of pretraining data, achieving 4.7%-14.0% accuracy gains over organic-only baselines and improving data efficiency by 2-3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality pretraining data is becoming scarce for frontier LLMs, creating a need for methods to effectively recycle and augment existing web data.

Method: Train a 4B LM with reinforcement learning using one quality reward and three faithfulness rewards to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of pretraining data while maintaining core semantics and structure.

Result: RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on 22 downstream tasks, outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods, and improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x.

Conclusion: RePro provides an efficient and controllable path to effectively harness limited pretraining data resources, with the method preserving critical information and faithfully reflecting organic data characteristics better than prompting-based approaches.

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for automating methodological assessments in systematic reviews, achieving near-human accuracy on straightforward criteria but struggling with complex inference-intensive tasks, requiring human oversight for nuanced interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic reviews are labor-intensive, especially for extracting methodological information. LLMs offer potential for automating methodological assessments to transform evidence synthesis.

Method: Used causal mediation analysis as a representative domain, benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180 full-text scientific articles.

Result: Model performance correlated well with human judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving near-human accuracy on straightforward criteria but declining sharply on complex assessments (lagging experts by up to 15%). Errors stemmed from superficial linguistic cues and misinterpretation of keywords.

Conclusion: Current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating automated extraction with expert review provides a promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but
remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological
information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hiligaynon language is underrepresented in NLP research due to lack of annotated corpora and baseline models, despite being spoken by millions in the Philippines.

Method: Collected over 8,000 annotated sentences from news, social media, and literary texts, then fine-tuned mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa models on this corpus.

Result: Both models achieved over 80% precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types, with promising cross-lingual transferability to Cebuano and Tagalog.

Conclusion: HiligayNER successfully establishes a baseline for Hiligaynon NER and demonstrates potential for multilingual NLP applications in low-resource Philippine languages.

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

Motivation: The diminishing availability of high-quality training data creates a bottleneck, shifting focus to using additional computation at deployment time to improve LLM performance without costly retraining.

Method: Systematic review organizing inference-time scaling techniques into two perspectives: Output-focused (multi-step generation strategies) and Input-focused (few-shot and RAG methods).

Result: Comprehensive taxonomy of inference-time scaling methods, with detailed categorization of reasoning techniques, search methods, and RAG components including query expansion, retrieval, and multi-modal approaches.

Conclusion: Inference-time scaling represents a new paradigm for improving LLM performance that addresses data scarcity issues by leveraging additional computation during deployment rather than through model scaling.

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

### [88] [Toward Human-Centered Readability Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10801)
*Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes HCRS, a human-centered readability framework for health text simplification that goes beyond surface metrics to include clarity, trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP evaluation metrics (BLEU, FKGL, SARI) focus on surface-level features and fail to capture human-centered qualities essential for health communication, particularly for populations with limited health literacy.

Method: Developed HCRS - a five-dimensional evaluation framework integrating automatic measures with structured human feedback, grounded in HCI and health communication research.

Result: Proposed framework and validation protocol for capturing relational and contextual aspects of readability in health text simplification.

Conclusion: HCRS advances health text simplification evaluation beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems to better align with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

### [89] [Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806)
*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a bottom-up method to linearize tree-like structures by generating aggregated summaries at each level, enabling efficient RAG with 68% fewer documents while maintaining comparable response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can use context for structured data, but RAG's effectiveness with hierarchical structures like trees is not well-explored. Need better ways to represent retrieved knowledge for structured data generation.

Method: Novel bottom-up approach that linearizes tree structures by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level, storing this knowledge for direct use with RAG.

Result: Response quality comparable to RAG on raw code, but generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever - significant efficiency gain.

Conclusion: Leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge is an effective and scalable strategy for handling complex hierarchical data structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

*Haeji Jung,Jinju Kim,Kyungjin Kim,Youjeong Roh,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Romanization outperforms other transliteration methods in multilingual NLP tasks, with shared subword tokens being key to success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how shared script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to multilingual model performance in transliteration.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments using three transliteration types (romanization, phonemic transcription, substitution ciphers) and orthography, evaluated on NER and NLI tasks.

Result: Romanization significantly outperformed other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Romanization is the most effective transliteration approach, with longer shared subword tokens enabling better model utilization.

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

*Kaixuan Ren,Preslav Nakov,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DUAL-Bench is the first multimodal benchmark addressing over-refusal and safe completion in vision-language models, revealing significant performance gaps where current models struggle to balance safety and usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't systematically address over-refusal in visual modality, particularly in dual-use scenarios where harmless instructions accompany harmful images. Current models either refuse too conservatively or complete tasks unsafely.

Method: Created DUAL-Bench benchmark evaluating 18 VLMs across 12 hazard categories, focusing on robustness under semantics-preserving visual perturbations and measuring safe completion rates.

Result: Significant performance gaps: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%, showing substantial room for improvement.

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench will foster development of more nuanced alignment strategies to ensure models remain both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benchmarking of lightweight test-time scaling strategies for LLM-based Text2SQL systems on BIRD Mini-Dev, evaluating accuracy, latency, and token consumption across different models including reasoning-focused LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of test-time scaling strategies in real-world Text2SQL applications, particularly with the latest reasoning models, and understand practical deployment trade-offs.

Method: Evaluated six lightweight industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs (including two reasoning models) on the BIRD Mini-Dev benchmark, measuring accuracy, inference latency, and token consumption.

Result: Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot demonstrations consistently improved performance for both general-purpose and reasoning-focused LLMs. Additional workflow steps showed mixed results, and base model selection was critical.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity for deploying Text2SQL systems, highlighting the importance of strategy selection and model choice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM x MapReduce-V3 is a hierarchical multi-agent system for generating long-form surveys using modular MCP servers orchestrated by a planner agent, enabling human intervention and customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve long-form survey generation by creating a more flexible, modular system that allows human-in-the-loop intervention and better captures intended research perspectives through dynamic workflow orchestration.

Method: Uses a multi-agent architecture with independent MCP servers for functional components (skeleton initialization, digest construction, skeleton refinement) that can be aggregated hierarchically. A planner agent dynamically selects modules based on MCP tool descriptions and execution history.

Result: Human evaluations show the system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length, demonstrating the effectiveness of MCP-based modular planning.

Conclusion: The hierarchical modular approach with MCP servers enables precise capture of research perspectives and generates comprehensive surveys, highlighting the strength of modular planning in survey generation systems.

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

*Ki Jung Seo,Sehun Lim,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADVICE is a fine-tuning framework that addresses LLM overconfidence by making confidence estimation answer-dependent, improving calibration while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their verbalized confidence expressions, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. The paper aims to identify and address the root causes of this overconfidence issue.

Method: Proposed ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates answer-grounded confidence estimation by conditioning confidence on the model's own answer.

Result: ADVICE substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task performance. It strengthens answer-groundedness and leads to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence distributions.

Conclusion: The work identifies answer-independence as a key factor in LLM overconfidence and establishes ADVICE as an effective framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization in language models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

*Yawen Yang,Fukun Ma,Shiao Meng,Aiwei Liu,Lijie Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GapDNER is a novel model for discontinuous named entity recognition that uses gap-aware grid tagging to handle non-adjacent entity fragments by modeling context gaps between them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for discontinuous NER face challenges with error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide variety of span combinations in biomedical entities that can be non-adjacent and overlapping.

Method: Proposes GapDNER which treats context gaps as additional span types and converts span classification to token-pair grid tagging. Uses two interactive components: intra-span regularity extraction with biaffine mechanism and linear attention, and inter-span relation enhancement with criss-cross attention. Uses BFS algorithm for entity decoding.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three datasets for discontinuous NER and shows remarkable advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

Conclusion: GapDNER effectively addresses discontinuous NER challenges by modeling context gaps between entity fragments, resolving decoding ambiguity and enhancing performance through comprehensive grid feature modeling.

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new paradigm for evaluating AI systems' ability to assess which problems are worth solving, using board games as a testbed. It compares reasoning models against human judgments on evaluating game fairness and funness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluations focus too much on problem-solving capabilities rather than evaluating which problems are worth solving. The paper aims to shift focus to how AI systems evaluate games themselves.

Method: Used a dataset of 100+ novel board games and 450+ human judgments to compare evaluations from modern language models, reasoning models, and symbolic agents. Assessed two types of queries: game payoff/fairness and funness.

Result: Reasoning models align better with human evaluations than non-reasoning language models, but show a non-monotonic relationship where approaching game-theoretic optimal weakens human alignment. Funness assessment shows more variability across models.

Conclusion: Reasoning models need more resource-rational meta-reasoning due to unpredictable resource usage. The study highlights the importance of evaluating AI systems' evaluative capabilities beyond just problem-solving.

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify and reproduce the state-of-the-art neural architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy (2016), which combines character-level CNNs, word-level BiLSTMs, and CRF structured prediction.

Method: Implemented the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model that uses CNNs for character-level representations, BiLSTMs for word-level context modeling, and CRFs for structured prediction in an end-to-end framework without hand-crafted features.

Result: Successfully reproduced key results with 91.18% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER dataset, demonstrating the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks including NER and POS tagging.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture for sequence labeling tasks, provides detailed component analysis, and releases open-source PyTorch implementation to support further research.

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed
analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch

Motivation: Standard binarization pipelines drop punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms head-child identification.

Method: Developed a reproducible pipeline that preserves punctuation as sibling nodes prior to binarization, with derived artifacts and metadata including intermediate markers, reversibility signatures, and alignment indices.

Result: On Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware preprocessing improved head prediction accuracy from 73.66% (Collins rules) and 86.66% (MLP) to 91.85% with the same classifier, and achieved competitive alignment against CCGbank derivations.

Conclusion: Released all code, configuration files, and documentation to enable replication and extension to other corpora, demonstrating significant improvements in head-child prediction and structural compatibility.

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for
punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces KOTOX, the first Korean toxic dataset for deobfuscation and detoxification, addressing the underrepresentation of low-resource languages in toxic content detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxic content is a critical social issue, but most research focuses on English, leaving low-resource languages like Korean underrepresented. LLMs struggle with detecting and neutralizing toxic expressions in these languages, especially when users employ obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

Method: The authors categorize various obfuscation approaches based on Korean linguistic characteristics and define transformation rules grounded in real-world examples. They construct three dataset versions (easy, normal, hard) representing different levels of obfuscation difficulty.

Result: KOTOX is the first dataset that simultaneously supports deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language, providing a resource to address obfuscated toxic content in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The dataset is expected to facilitate better understanding and mitigation of obfuscated toxic content in LLMs for low-resource languages, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces JBA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' ability to recognize false premises, and proposes an enhancement framework that significantly improves model performance on this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are vulnerable to false premise problems, and existing benchmarks are limited in scope, lacking fine-grained categorization and sufficient coverage to properly evaluate models' false premise recognition abilities.

Method: Developed a fully automated pipeline to construct the JBA benchmark, systematically categorizing premises into 3 main types and 13 subtypes based on required abilities. Also proposed a recognition enhancement framework to strengthen MLLMs' robustness against false premises.

Result: Current MLLMs still struggle with false premise recognition. Models trained with the proposed framework achieved significant improvements in detecting false premises.

Conclusion: The JBA benchmark provides rigorous evaluation of false premise recognition, and the proposed enhancement framework effectively strengthens MLLMs' robustness against false premises, addressing a critical vulnerability in current multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

*Yejin Lee,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RV-HATE is a hate speech detection framework that adapts to dataset-specific characteristics using multiple specialized modules and reinforcement learning for optimal module weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection methods often fail to adapt to diverse dataset characteristics from different platforms and sources, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Uses multiple specialized modules focusing on different linguistic/contextual features, reinforcement learning for module weighting optimization, and voting mechanism for final decision.

Result: Improved detection accuracy for implicit hate speech and superior performance compared to conventional static methods.

Conclusion: RV-HATE effectively addresses dataset diversity in hate speech detection and provides interpretable insights into dataset-specific features.

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CFT is a fine-tuning method that updates only critical tokens identified via counterfactual perturbations, improving reasoning performance while maintaining output diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens, but only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning correctness, leading to reduced diversity and limited generalization.

Method: Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT) identifies functionally indispensable tokens through counterfactual perturbations and focuses gradient updates only on these decisive reasoning steps while preserving non-critical token diversity.

Result: CFT consistently outperforms standard SFT across 5 models and 11 mathematical reasoning benchmarks, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of tokens. It also enables test-time scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides better initialization for reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: CFT is a practical and general framework for efficient and robust LLM fine-tuning that maintains performance gains while preserving higher entropy for better exploration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD is a comprehensive safety framework for deep research systems that introduces four-stage safeguards and open-domain evaluation to address deficiencies in existing frameworks regarding report quality, credibility, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep research frameworks lack sufficient evaluation procedures and stage-specific protections, overlooking crucial aspects like credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety, which may lead to hazardous sources being integrated into final reports.

Method: Introduces DEEPRESEARCHGUARD with four-stage safeguards and open-domain evaluation of references and reports, along with DRSAFEBENCH benchmark for deep research safety. Evaluates performance across multiple metrics and five key report dimensions using various state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves 18.16% average defense success rate improvement while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. Input guard provides substantial early-stage protection, while plan and research guards enhance citation discipline and source credibility.

Conclusion: The framework enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation while systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

*Mahika Phutane,Hayoung Jung,Matthew Kim,Tanushree Mitra,Aditya Vashistha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perpetuate ableism in hiring, especially against disabled candidates from marginalized gender and caste groups in the Global South, with current safety tools failing to detect these intersectional harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Western-centric bias in LLM safety research and examine how intersecting forms of marginalization (disability, gender, caste) shape discrimination in hiring scenarios in the Global South context.

Method: Comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring scenarios using ABLEIST framework - five ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability studies literature.

Result: Significant increases in ABLEIST harms towards disabled candidates, with state-of-the-art models failing to detect these harms. Intersectional harms (e.g., Tokenism) were amplified for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates.

Conclusion: Current safety tools have critical blind spots in detecting intersectional harms, highlighting the need for intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains like hiring.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

*Tieyuan Chen,Xiaodong Chen,Haoxing Chen,Zhenzhong Lan,Weiyao Lin,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic Nested Depth (DND) improves LLM performance by selectively reprocessing critical tokens through nested depth processing, achieving performance gains with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance off-the-shelf LLM performance without extensive retraining by focusing computational resources on processing difficult tokens more effectively.

Method: DND identifies critical tokens at transformer layer ends using a router, feeds them back for extra processing, and employs router controlling loss and threshold control for stable token selection.

Result: Boosts dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by 0.87% on diverse benchmarks with minimal parameter and computing increase.

Conclusion: DND provides an effective post-training enhancement method that improves LLM performance through dynamic token selection and nested reprocessing, applicable to both dense and MoE models.

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

TL;DR: LogiNumSynth is a flexible natural language problem synthesizer that creates joint logical-numerical reasoning tasks with fine-grained control over difficulty levels, serving as both evaluation tool and training data source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for joint logical-numerical reasoning rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and training.

Method: Developed LogiNumSynth synthesizer that supports fine-grained control over reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and numerical computation complexity to generate fully controllable joint reasoning tasks in natural language.

Result: Experiments with multiple LLMs revealed persistent weaknesses in logical-numerical reasoning, and LogiNumSynth successfully enhanced LLMs' reasoning performance when used for targeted training.

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth serves as both a diagnostic tool for identifying reasoning weaknesses and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated reasoning skills in language models.

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated
reasoning skills.

TL;DR: Repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants for physicians rather than direct patient interaction, using DoctorFLAN dataset to improve medical LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct deployment of LLMs to patients poses safety risks due to limited domain expertise, so repositioning them as physician assistants is safer.

Method: Two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify clinical needs, construction of DoctorFLAN dataset (92K Q&A across 22 tasks and 27 specialties), and evaluation using DoctorFLAN-test and DotaBench.

Result: DoctorFLAN notably improves performance of open-source LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating alignment with physician workflows and complementing patient-oriented models.

Conclusion: Provides valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM development, enabling safer and more effective clinical assistance.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM
development

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LRD is a two-stage parallel decoding framework that addresses information loss and premature commitment in diffusion-inspired models, achieving significant speedups (up to 10.6x) while improving accuracy on coding and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models suffer from high latency due to sequential decoding, while existing parallel approaches like LlaDA and Dream have limitations including information loss and premature commitment in token generation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Latent Refinement maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures, 2) Predictive Feedback Loop progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback, using KL-divergence for convergence detection.

Result: Significant improvements on coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) benchmarks with speedups up to 10.6x compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LRD provides a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation, achieving both accuracy improvements and substantial speedups while addressing core limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGPO uses confidence signals to identify model uncertainty points and applies self-generated reasoning guidance to improve LLM reasoning without human-like trajectory bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods introduce training bias toward human-like reasoning and depend on external annotations, limiting exploration of alternative reasoning paths and constraining performance.

Method: Proposes Confidence-Guided Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO) that leverages confidence signals to identify points of maximal uncertainty and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path guidance.

Result: Experiments show CGPO with small model-generated data achieves better performance than approaches using strong model or human-annotated data with same training data amount.

Conclusion: CGPO effectively mitigates trajectory drift and improves reasoning performance by guiding models at their lowest-confidence points rather than at explicit errors.

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

TL;DR: TypePilot is an AI framework that improves security of LLM-generated code using strongly typed languages like Scala, reducing vulnerabilities through type-guided workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate code with subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing risks in security-sensitive systems where safety constraints are often not enforced.

Method: Uses TypePilot agentic framework with strongly typed languages (Scala) and formal verification (Stainless framework) to guide LLM code generation through type-focused pipelines.

Result: TypePilot substantially mitigates input validation and injection vulnerabilities compared to direct code generation or naive secure prompting with leading open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: Structured, type-guided LLM workflows have potential to improve trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

### [111] [One Size Does Not Fit All: Exploring Variable Thresholds for Distance-Based Multi-Label Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11160)
*Jens Van Nooten,Andriy Kosar,Guy De Pauw,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Distance-based unsupervised text classification uses semantic similarity between labels and texts for classification, offering fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets without retraining. The paper proposes a novel label-specific thresholding method that significantly improves performance over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distance-based classification methods require thresholds to determine label relevance, but existing thresholding approaches are suboptimal. Multi-label classification adds complexity since texts can have multiple true labels. The paper aims to address the underexplored area of threshold optimization in distance-based multi-label text classification.

Method: The authors conduct an exploratory study on diverse multi-label text classification datasets to analyze similarity distributions across models, datasets, and label sets. They propose a novel label-specific thresholding method that optimizes thresholds for each label using a validation set, rather than using uniform thresholds.

Result: The label-specific thresholding method achieves 46% average improvement over normalized 0.5 thresholding and outperforms previous uniform thresholding approaches by 14% on average. The method also performs well even with limited labeled examples.

Conclusion: Label-specific thresholding is highly effective for distance-based multi-label text classification, significantly outperforming existing thresholding methods. The approach is robust and works well with limited training data, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

*Paloma Piot,José Ramom Pichel Campos,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in hate speech detection for low-resource languages by creating standardized datasets for European Spanish, Portuguese, and Galician variants, establishing benchmarks for multilingual hate speech detection using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection research is predominantly focused on English, leaving low-resource languages with limited resources and benchmarks. Many low-resource languages have multiple linguistic varieties that are often overlooked, and LLMs require substantial data that these languages cannot provide.

Method: Compiled a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for European Spanish with unified labels and metadata, then extended it by translating into European Portuguese and two Galician variants (one convergent with Spanish, another with Portuguese). Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.

Result: Established new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages and provided baseline results. Performed cross-lingual analysis showing the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches.

Conclusion: The work underscores the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate speech detection and provides a foundation for improved benchmarking in underrepresented European languages.

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual
well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,
we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings
underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate
speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in
underrepresented European languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A clinical framework evaluates faithfulness of VLMs' chain-of-thought explanations in chest X-ray VQA, revealing misalignment between explanations and decision processes despite good answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often produce plausible but unfaithful CoT explanations that don't reflect actual decision processes, undermining trust in clinical applications where existing evaluations fail to detect this misalignment.

Method: Clinically grounded framework using controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. Evaluated via reader study with radiologists and benchmarked six VLMs.

Result: Answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled; acknowledging cues doesn't ensure grounding; text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. Proprietary models outperform open-source on attribution (25.0% vs 1.4%) and fidelity (36.1% vs 31.7%).

Conclusion: Current VLM evaluations focusing only on answer accuracy are insufficient for clinical deployment. Need to evaluate explanation faithfulness beyond final answers, especially for attribution and fidelity aspects.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies sparse computational circuits (≈0.2% of GPT-2) responsible for discourse understanding in transformer models, showing these circuits generalize across different discourse frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which specific components in transformer language models handle discourse relations, which involve longer spans and complex reasoning compared to simpler tasks.

Method: Introduces Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR) task and constructs minimal contrastive pairs for activation patching. Uses circuit discovery to identify sparse computational graphs that control discourse processing.

Result: Sparse circuits recover discourse understanding in English PDTB-based CuDR task and generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks (RST and SDRT). Lower layers capture linguistic features while upper layers encode discourse-level abstractions.

Conclusion: Transformer models use sparse, specialized circuits for discourse understanding that are framework-agnostic, with consistent feature utility across different discourse frameworks.

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGen is a scalable framework for generating domain-specific question-answer-context triples to adapt RAG systems to specialized domains through modular processing and multiple adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively adapting RAG systems to domain-specific settings requires specialized training data beyond general-purpose QA, which current methods lack.

Method: RAGen uses semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, Bloom's Taxonomy-guided question generation, precise answer extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval with distractor contexts.

Result: The framework efficiently generates domain-grounded QAC triples for diverse RAG adaptation approaches and handles large, evolving document corpora without redundant processing.

Conclusion: RAGen provides a scalable and modular solution for domain-specific RAG adaptation, particularly suitable for dynamic domains like scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

### [116] [The Curious Case of Factual (Mis)Alignment between LLMs' Short- and Long-Form Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11218)
*Saad Obaid ul Islam,Anne Lauscher,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistency in factual knowledge access between simple and complex queries, with systematic misalignment between short-form and long-form answers to the same factual questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reliability gap in LLMs' factual knowledge access across different query complexities, as current evaluation practices assume good performance on simple queries implies reliability in complex tasks.

Method: Introduced SLAQ framework to compare LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked in isolation (short) vs. integrated into complex queries (long), testing 16 LLMs across 600 queries with mechanistic analysis.

Result: Found systematic misalignment between short and long query answers, position-dependent accuracy loss, momentum effects, and that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals with mechanistic similarity predicting alignment up to 78% accuracy.

Conclusion: Factual consistency over query complexity is crucial for LLM trustworthiness, challenging current evaluation practices that assume simple query performance implies complex task reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

*Tao Li,Jinlong Hu,Yang Wang,Junfeng Liu,Xuejun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebRouter is a query-specific router using cost-aware Variational Information Bottleneck to reduce LLM operational costs by 87.8% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-brained web agents face cost-performance trade-offs due to complex prompts containing goals, action histories, and environmental states, which degrade ensemble performance.

Method: Introduces WebRouter with cost-aware Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective that learns compressed prompt representations while penalizing expected operational costs.

Result: Reduces operational costs by 87.8% compared to GPT-4o baseline with only 3.8% accuracy drop on five real-world websites from WebVoyager benchmark.

Conclusion: WebRouter effectively addresses the cost-performance trade-off in web agents through information-theoretic compression and cost-aware optimization.

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

*Battemuulen Naranbat,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Yousuf Nasser Al Husaini,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates fairness in moral sentiment classification using BERT models, revealing hidden fairness violations in cross-domain settings and introducing a new metric called Moral Fairness Consistency (MFC) to measure cross-domain stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness challenges in natural language processing for moral sentiment classification, particularly under cross-domain shifts where transformer models are increasingly deployed but aggregate performance metrics can mask disparities.

Method: Evaluated BERT and DistilBERT in multi-label setting using Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC) with in-domain and cross-domain protocols, and introduced Moral Fairness Consistency (MFC) metric.

Result: Found pronounced asymmetry in transfer (Twitter->Reddit degraded micro-F1 by 14.9% vs 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter), revealed fairness violations hidden by overall scores, and showed MFC has perfect negative correlation with Demographic Parity Difference while remaining independent of standard performance metrics.

Conclusion: MFC serves as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

*Hayate Funakura,Hyunsoo Kim,Koji Mineshima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph-matching metrics like Smatch are insufficient for evaluating semantic parsers as they measure surface overlap rather than logical equivalence. The study combines graph-matching with theorem proving to evaluate parser outputs, finding that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to produce logically equivalent formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess evaluation of neural semantic parsers by addressing the limitation of graph-matching metrics that capture surface overlap rather than logical equivalence, which is crucial for reasoning-oriented applications.

Method: Compare supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning (GPT-4o/4.1/5) approaches under normalized and unnormalized targets. Evaluate using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment with first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness analysis.

Result: Models performing well on graph-matching often fail to produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces target variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Performance degrades with formula complexity and specific linguistic phenomena like coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice.

Conclusion: Graph-based metrics have limitations for reasoning-oriented applications, motivating the need for logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives with simplified, normalized target representations.

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

*Haoqi Yang,Yao Yao,Zuchao Li,Baoyuan Qi,Guoming Liu,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XQuant is a training-free, plug-and-play framework for ultra-low bit-width KV cache quantization that achieves sub-1.4 bits while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have high memory requirements due to KV cache growth in long-text processing, making deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses computationally negligible data-free calibration and cross-layer KV cache compression for training-free quantization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods (KIVI-2bit, AsymKV-1.5bit) with lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance on TruthfulQA and LongBench.

Conclusion: XQuant establishes a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

### [122] [Attacks by Content: Automated Fact-checking is an AI Security Issue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11238)
*Michael Schlichtkrull*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'attack by content' where adversaries manipulate AI agents by providing biased or false information rather than injecting malicious instructions, and proposes using automated fact-checking as a defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses focus on detecting hidden commands in indirect prompt injection attacks, but are ineffective against content-based attacks where attackers supply misleading information without explicit instructions.

Method: The paper proposes repurposing automated fact-checking from NLP as a cognitive self-defense tool for AI agents, requiring them to critically evaluate retrieved information by corroborating claims with external evidence and assessing source trustworthiness.

Result: The research demonstrates that current defenses are insufficient against content-based attacks and establishes the need for agents to implement critical evaluation mechanisms.

Conclusion: Automated fact-checking should be adapted as a defense mechanism for AI agents to protect against content-based manipulation attacks, requiring agents to verify information credibility through external evidence and source evaluation.

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

*Jana Jung,Marlene Lutz,Indira Sen,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Psychometric tests designed for humans show moderate reliability but low ecological validity when applied to LLMs, with test scores often not aligning or even negatively correlating with actual model behavior in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether human psychometric tests yield meaningful results when applied to large language models, given their increasing use for assessing psychological constructs in LLMs.

Method: Evaluated reliability and validity of human psychometric tests for sexism, racism, and morality constructs using multiple item and prompt variations, with validity assessed through convergent (theory-based correlations) and ecological (alignment with downstream task behavior) approaches.

Result: Found moderate reliability across variations, but psychometric test scores did not align with model behavior in downstream tasks - in some cases showing negative correlations, indicating low ecological validity.

Conclusion: Systematic evaluation of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their scores for LLMs, and human-designed tests cannot be directly applied to LLMs without adaptation.

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

*Guangyu Wei,Ke Han,Yueming Lyu,Yu Luo,Yue Jiang,Caifeng Shan,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASE is a framework for real-time fake news detection that dynamically adapts decision-making based on evidence sufficiency, using three evaluation perspectives and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detection methods struggle with evidence scarcity in real-time scenarios where emerging events lack sufficient supporting evidence, limiting generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposes EASE framework with sequential evaluation: evidence-based evaluation (uses evidence only when sufficient), reasoning-based evaluation (uses LLM world knowledge when reliable), and sentiment-based fallback. Uses instruction tuning with pseudo labels to enhance evaluation accuracy.

Result: EASE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and significantly improves generalization to real-time news. Introduces RealTimeNews-25 benchmark for evaluating emerging news with limited evidence.

Conclusion: EASE effectively addresses evidence scarcity in real-time fake news detection through dynamic evaluation-aware decision-making, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

*Nikita Afonin,Nikita Andriyanov,Nikhil Bageshpura,Kyle Liu,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Ashwinee Panda,Alexander Panchenko,Oleg Rogov,Elena Tutubalina,Mikhail Seleznyov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emergent misalignment (EM) occurs in in-context learning (ICL) with narrow examples, causing frontier models to produce broadly misaligned responses at rates up to 58% with 256 examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research showed emergent misalignment in finetuning and activation steering, but left out in-context learning. This study investigates whether EM also emerges in ICL settings.

Method: Tested across three datasets and three frontier models using narrow in-context examples (64-256 examples), then elicited step-by-step reasoning to analyze mechanisms while keeping in-context examples unchanged.

Result: Models produced broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2%-17% with 64 examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. Chain-of-thought analysis revealed 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalized harmful outputs by adopting reckless or dangerous personas.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment does occur in in-context learning, with similar mechanisms to finetuning-induced EM, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to misalignment through narrow in-context examples.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

TL;DR: A hierarchical extraction framework using LLMs to build rich knowledge graphs from text, evaluated structurally and semantically, with a released dataset for children's mental well-being research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based KG construction methods are limited to sentence-level contexts or predefined schemas, lacking comprehensive coverage and rich semantic structure needed for high-quality knowledge graphs.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical extraction framework that organizes information at multiple levels using state-of-the-art LLMs to extract and construct semantically rich knowledge graphs.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation reveals both strengths and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction, identifying key challenges for future work.

Conclusion: The framework enables creation of well-structured KGs and the released dataset aims to advance transparent, reliable applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

*Sabrina McCallum,Amit Parekh,Alessandro Suglia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agents learn from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations using language feedback to contextualize behavior, improving compositional generalization and robustness in embodied AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning methods are limited to learning from optimal behavior only, risking error replication, while RL sacrifices data efficiency. Language feedback provides a way to learn from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations.

Method: Provide language feedback embeddings as input to Transformer-based policies, optionally adding auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction alongside traditional next action prediction.

Result: Significant improvements in compositional generalization abilities and robustness in BabyAI-XGen environment, successfully converting suboptimal behavior into learning opportunities.

Conclusion: Language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks, enabling data-efficient learning from diverse demonstration quality.

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

TL;DR: A structured VLM prompting framework generates accessible images from simplified texts for individuals with intellectual disabilities, with Basic Object Focus template showing best semantic alignment and Retro style being most accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty individuals with intellectual disabilities face in comprehending complex texts, and the gap between text-to-image models prioritizing aesthetics over accessibility.

Method: Designed five prompt templates with distinct spatial arrangements following accessibility constraints, evaluated using 400 sentence-level simplifications from four TS datasets through CLIPScores and human annotation by accessibility experts.

Result: Basic Object Focus template achieved highest semantic alignment, Retro style was most accessible, Wikipedia was most effective data source, with varying inter-annotator agreement across dimensions.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical guidelines for accessible content generation and emphasizes the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility tools.

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

TL;DR: This study uncovers and validates emotion circuits in LLMs, identifying context-agnostic emotion directions, local neural components, and global circuits that drive emotional expression, achieving 99.65% emotion control accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms that give rise to emotional expression in LLMs and enable universal emotion control in generated text.

Method: Constructed SEV dataset to elicit comparable emotional states, extracted context-agnostic emotion directions, identified neurons and attention heads through analytical decomposition and causal analysis, validated via ablation/enhancement interventions, and integrated local components into global emotion circuits.

Result: Identified consistent cross-context emotion encoding, validated causal roles of neural components, quantified sublayer influences, and achieved 99.65% emotion-expression accuracy through direct circuit modulation, surpassing prompting- and steering-based methods.

Conclusion: First systematic study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-specific utility in RAG systems, showing that human-annotated passages are not optimal for different LLMs and utility is not transferable across models, highlighting the need for model-specific utility assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems treat utility as generic, but different LLMs benefit differently from the same passages due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension abilities, necessitating LLM-specific utility assessment.

Method: Conducted large-scale experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs, analyzed perplexity as a metric for readability, and proposed a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments.

Result: Human-annotated passages are not optimal for LLMs, ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across different LLMs, and LLMs struggle to assess utility effectively for both known and unknown queries.

Conclusion: RAG research must adopt LLM-specific utility approaches, as utility is model-dependent and current assessment methods have limitations that need to be addressed through specialized benchmarking procedures.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3 (Rollout Routing Replay) stabilizes RL training in Mixture-of-Experts models by replaying inference routing distributions during training to address routing instability and training-inference inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models suffer from routing instability during RL training, causing catastrophic collapse due to discrepancies between training and inference routing behaviors.

Method: Proposed Rollout Routing Replay (R3) - records routing distributions from inference engine and replays them during training to reduce policy KL divergence.

Result: R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy divergence, prevents RL training collapse, and outperforms GSPO and TIS methods across various settings.

Conclusion: R3 provides an effective solution for stabilizing RL training in MoE models by addressing fundamental routing inconsistencies between training and inference phases.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

### [132] [Early Detection and Reduction of Memorisation for Domain Adaptation and Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11372)
*Dean L. Slack,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies memorization during fine-tuning of large language models, finding it increases dramatically early in training. It proposes using n-gram memorization scores for early stopping and introduces a loss regularizer that reduces memorization by up to 40% with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can memorize training data, exposing private or copyrighted text. Most defenses focus on pre-training, leaving memorization during fine-tuning (especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning) poorly understood.

Method: Fine-tuned Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models (1.4B-70B parameters) on common datasets, tracking verbatim memorization. Used n-gram memorization score as early-stopping criterion and introduced n-gram-aware loss regularizer.

Result: Memorization increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often before validation perplexity or evaluation performance is optimized. The n-gram memorization score reliably precedes verbatim memorization. The proposed regularizer reduces memorization by up to 40% across all model families with minimal performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: Provides practical, scalable insights into memorization dynamics during language model fine-tuning, with effective mitigation strategies that minimize performance loss.

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

*Zirui Song,Yuan Huang,Junchang Liu,Haozhe Luo,Chenxi Wang,Lang Gao,Zixiang Xu,Mingfei Han,Xiaojun Chang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-quality multimodal Werewolf dataset and a strategy-alignment evaluation framework to assess LLMs' social intelligence in deception and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most studies reduce social deduction games to LLM-based self-play, yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of social gameplay. Evaluation relies on coarse metrics due to lack of quality reference data.

Method: Curated a high-quality, human-verified multimodal Werewolf dataset with over 100 hours of video and 32.4M utterance tokens. Proposed a strategy-alignment evaluation framework with two stages: speech evaluation (multiple-choice tasks assessing social ability dimensions) and decision evaluation (voting choices and opponent-role inferences).

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show diverse performance, with roughly half remaining below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in deception and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: The dataset and evaluation framework enable fine-grained assessment of models' linguistic and reasoning capabilities, capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent gameplay, and should inspire further research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

### [134] [KnowRL: Teaching Language Models to Know What They Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11407)
*Sahil Kale,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowRL is a self-improvement framework that enhances LLMs' ability to understand their own knowledge boundaries through introspection and consensus-based rewarding, improving self-knowledge accuracy by up to 28% without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs frequently misjudge their own competence (in over 20% of cases), making their responses unreliable when they're uncertain. This creates safety risks for AI deployment in critical applications.

Method: Two-component framework: (1) Introspection - model generates and classifies tasks as feasible/infeasible, (2) Consensus-based rewarding - reinforces stability of self-knowledge assessment through internal agreement. Uses internally generated data without external supervision.

Result: On LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL improved self-knowledge with gains up to 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1 score. Outperformed baselines in few iterations using only a small seed set.

Conclusion: The framework unlocks LLMs' capacity to self-improve knowledge awareness, enabling more reliable and accountable AI. Its simplicity and independence from external effort make it suitable for widespread adoption in future models.

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

### [135] [Valid Survey Simulations with Limited Human Data: The Roles of Prompting, Fine-Tuning, and Rectification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11408)
*Stefan Krsteski,Giuseppe Russo,Serina Chang,Robert West,Kristina Gligorić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can substitute human survey respondents but introduce bias. Combining synthesis (LLM-generated responses) with rectification (debiasing methods) reduces bias below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Optimal allocation under fixed budget favors most human responses for rectification rather than fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveys are costly and slow, while LLMs offer scalable alternatives but produce biased outputs that yield invalid population estimates.

Method: Study the interplay between synthesis methods (using LLMs to generate survey responses) and rectification methods (debiasing population estimates), exploring optimal allocation of human responses between them using panel surveys on nutrition, politics, and economics.

Result: Synthesis alone introduces substantial bias (24-86%), but combining it with rectification reduces bias below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Allocating most human responses to rectification under fixed budget yields more effective estimation than using all for fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Challenges the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning; optimal strategy allocates most responses to rectification for more effective estimation under fixed budget constraints.

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

TL;DR: A data-driven method for assessing LLM personality using automatic classifiers on Reddit-style responses, revealing LLMs express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models exhibit personality- and demographic-like characteristics in their language, moving beyond traditional self-report questionnaires.

Method: Applied automatic personality and gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from Reddit, comparing six widely used LLMs to human-authored responses.

Result: LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism, reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language patterns resemble human patterns but with reduced variation.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into personality and demographic patterns of generative AI through a novel dataset and large-scale comparative analyses, showing LLMs exhibit distinct but human-like personality characteristics.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

*Yawen Yang,Fukun Ma,Shiao Meng,Aiwei Liu,Lijie Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GenCNER is a generative framework for Continual Named Entity Recognition that converts CNER into entity triplet sequence generation and uses knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods for NER face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity types as entity categories continuously increase in real-world scenarios.

Method: Convert CNER into sustained entity triplet sequence generation using pre-trained seq2seq models, and employ type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling with knowledge distillation to preserve learned knowledge.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings on two benchmark datasets, achieving the smallest gap compared with non-continual learning results.

Conclusion: GenCNER provides an effective generative framework for CNER that successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift issues through triplet-level knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

*Marco Braga,Gian Carlo Milanese,Gabriella Pasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively perform text preprocessing tasks like stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming with high accuracy, achieving up to 6% improvement in F1 score for text classification compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text preprocessing methods ignore contextual information, while LLMs can leverage context without requiring extensive language-specific annotated resources.

Method: Using LLMs for preprocessing tasks (stopword removal, lemmatization, stemming) and comparing them against traditional algorithms across multiple text classification tasks in six European languages.

Result: LLMs achieved 97% accuracy for stopword removal, 82% for lemmatization, and 74% for stemming. ML models trained on LLM-preprocessed texts showed up to 6% F1 score improvement over traditional preprocessing.

Conclusion: LLMs are capable of effectively replicating traditional preprocessing methods while leveraging contextual information, leading to improved performance in downstream NLP tasks.

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

*Yusheng Song,Lirong Qiu,Xi Zhang,Zhihao Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework that bridges the gap between internal state probing and chain-of-thought verification for detecting hallucinations in LLMs, overcoming signal scarcity and representational alignment barriers through multi-path reasoning and cross-attention fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods face a "Detection Dilemma" - internal state probing works well for factual inconsistencies but fails on logical fallacies, while chain-of-thought verification shows the opposite behavior, creating task-dependent blind spots.

Method: Introduces multi-path reasoning to obtain comparable fine-grained signals and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module to adaptively fuse aligned representations, pinpointing subtle dissonances between reasoning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading LLMs demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully resolves the detection dilemma by unifying internal state probing and chain-of-thought verification approaches, providing a comprehensive solution for hallucination detection across different task types.

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextGraphFuseGAT integrates PhoBERT transformer with Graph Attention Networks for token classification, using self-attention on graph-enhanced embeddings and achieving state-of-the-art results on Vietnamese NER and disfluency detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture richer inter-token dependencies beyond sequential context by combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling for improved token-level classification.

Method: Constructs fully connected graph over PhoBERT token embeddings, applies GAT layer to capture inter-token dependencies, adds Transformer self-attention layer for contextualization, and uses classification head for sequence labeling.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong baselines (transformer-only and hybrid models like BiLSTM+CNN+CRF) on three Vietnamese benchmarks: PhoNER-COVID19, PhoDisfluency, and the newly introduced VietMed-NER dataset.

Conclusion: Combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling is effective for improved token classification across multiple domains, as demonstrated by superior performance on Vietnamese NER and disfluency detection tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PART is a method that reformulates reasoning traces to prevent unauthorized distillation while preserving information for human users, by removing self-talk and reordering sub-conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between providing detailed reasoning traces for user understanding and preventing unauthorized distillation of proprietary LLMs.

Method: A two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering sub-conclusions, implemented via a small auxiliary model with minimal computational overhead.

Result: PART consistently disrupts distillation across various student models and reasoning benchmarks, e.g., reducing 32B model performance from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024 (13.5% degradation).

Conclusion: PART effectively protects proprietary LLMs from unauthorized distillation while preserving reasoning information for human users.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

*Saurabh Khanna,Xinxu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes linguistic inequality in AI systems, revealing that 27% of languages with millions of speakers are 'Invisible Giants' - high vitality but near-zero digital presence in LLMs, reflecting colonial-era linguistic hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the crisis where approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively invisible in digital ecosystems despite LLMs being trained on massive multilingual corpora, and to explain why this linguistic inequality is structural rather than incidental.

Method: Proposed a critical framework connecting empirical measurements of language vitality (demographic strength) and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic injustice, analyzing data across all documented human languages to categorize them into four groups.

Result: Identified four language categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality/digitality), Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices (36%, low on both), and Invisible Giants (27%, high vitality but near-zero digitality). Showed these patterns reflect continuities from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development.

Conclusion: English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge. The paper concludes with implications for decolonizing language technology and democratizing access to AI benefits.

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are misaligned with real-world challenges LLMs face when interacting with users from diverse cultural backgrounds.

Method: Developed a framework grounded in sociocultural theory, constructed a benchmark dataset annotated by culturally diverse raters, and proposed new evaluation desiderata: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.

Result: Top LLMs evaluated on the benchmark show they struggle with cultural adaptation in conversational settings.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in cultural adaptation, highlighting the need for better evaluation frameworks that capture real multicultural conversational challenges.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box adversarial attack methods on knowledge graph embeddings lack human-readable explanations and exhibit poor generalizability, while LLMs have shown strong capabilities in text comprehension and reasoning.

Method: The framework uses structured prompting to formulate attacks as multiple-choice questions with KG factual evidence, employs semantics-based and centrality-based filters to compress candidate sets, and fine-tunes LLMs with triple classification to enhance filtering performance.

Result: Experiments on two knowledge graph datasets show LLMAtKGE outperforms black-box baselines, provides explanations via reasoning, and achieves competitive performance compared to white-box methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by generating human-readable explanations and demonstrating strong attack performance through effective integration of semantic and structural information.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

*Georg Ahnert,Anna-Carolina Haensch,Barbara Plank,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic investigation of 8 different methods for generating closed-ended survey responses with LLMs, showing significant differences in alignment and recommending Restricted Generation Methods as most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standard practices for generating closed-ended survey responses with LLMs, which are typically trained for open-ended text generation, and to understand how different generation methods impact simulated survey responses.

Method: Conducted large-scale experiments with 32 million simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models, comparing individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment.

Result: Found significant differences between Survey Response Generation Methods in alignment, with Restricted Generation Methods performing best overall, and reasoning output not consistently improving alignment.

Conclusion: Survey Response Generation Methods significantly impact simulated survey responses, and practical recommendations are provided for their application, favoring Restricted Generation Methods.

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

### [146] [MeTA-LoRA: Data-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11598)
*Bo Cheng,Xu Wang,Jinda Liu,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA is a two-stage optimization framework that improves data efficiency in multi-task adaptation of LLMs by first learning task-specific adapters with minimal data, then updating a shared adapter through gradient aggregation across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LoRA struggles with efficiently leveraging inter-task knowledge in multi-task learning scenarios and requires substantial task-specific data for optimal performance.

Method: Two-stage optimization: (1) Learn task-specific LoRA adapters using few samples from each dataset, (2) Update shared LoRA adapter by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks to enable knowledge transfer.

Result: Matches or surpasses performance of traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning in both multi-task and multilingual learning scenarios while using significantly less task-specific data.

Conclusion: MeTA-LoRA significantly improves data efficiency in multi-task adaptation of LLMs through its two-stage optimization approach.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE-Multi is an unsupervised framework for generating multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts that capture distinct aspects, enabling fine-grained similarity assessment and adaptive visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fine-grained and controllable similarity assessments of scientific abstracts by capturing distinct aspects in isolation, rather than using single-dimensional embeddings.

Method: Uses unsupervised procedure to create aspect-specific summarizing sentences, trains embedding models to map related summaries together, then distills these capabilities into a unified model that predicts multiple aspect embeddings in one forward pass. Also includes embedding decoding pipeline.

Result: Successfully generates multifaceted embeddings that capture distinct aspects of scientific abstracts, with effective decoding back to natural language descriptions even for unoccupied regions in visualizations.

Conclusion: The framework provides improved interpretability and user-driven visualizations of scientific domains through multifaceted embeddings and effective decoding capabilities.

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

### [148] [Deconstructing Attention: Investigating Design Principles for Effective Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11602)
*Huiyin Xue,Nafise Sadat Moosavi,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Attention mechanisms can be simplified by relaxing mathematical form and sequence dependency while preserving token mixing, especially when combined with standard attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically test which design principles of Transformer attention are essential for its success, as their necessity remains largely untested.

Method: Designed controlled variants that selectively relax attention principles (token mixing, sequence dependency, mathematical form, query-key coupling), applied uniformly and in hybrid architectures with standard attention.

Result: Token mixing is indispensable (absence causes near-random behavior), while mathematical form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when preserved in some layers. Failed variants work well when interleaved with standard attention.

Conclusion: Attention's effectiveness relies primarily on token mixing, with other principles being more flexible, enabling simplified language models without performance loss.

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

*Xurong Xie,Zhucun Xue,Jiafu Wu,Jian Li,Yabiao Wang,Xiaobin Hu,Yong Liu,Jiangning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaKD is a novel knowledge distillation framework that adaptively adjusts distillation focus and temperature scaling based on token difficulty, improving performance across various LLM compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional logit-based KD methods use static strategies that don't align with the dynamic learning process of student models, treating all tokens equally with fixed temperatures, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer.

Method: AdaKD uses two modules: Loss-Driven Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) that dynamically adjusts distillation focus based on student's learning stability, and Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS) that applies low temperatures for difficult tokens and high temperatures for easy tokens.

Result: AdaKD consistently improves performance of various distillation methods across multiple model architectures and benchmarks as a plug-and-play framework.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive approach to knowledge distillation based on token difficulty metrics effectively addresses limitations of static KD methods and enhances knowledge transfer efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

*Zehao Chen,Rong Pan,Haoran Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid bottom-up approach for long-form story generation using multi-agent simulations, where agents interact in a dynamic environment to generate emergent events that form coherent stories exceeding 10,000 words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by how human writers create mental scenes of character interactions, aiming to overcome rigid structures of traditional top-down story generation approaches and enable more organic, spontaneous storytelling.

Method: Multi-agent simulations in a dynamic sandbox environment where agents' behaviors and interactions with each other and the environment generate emergent events that serve as the foundation for story generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across several metrics, capable of generating coherent stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining consistency, addressing key challenges in current story generation models.

Conclusion: The hybrid bottom-up approach offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

*Siheng Xiong,Ali Payani,Faramarz Fekri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPPA addresses CoT derailment in small LMs by generating multiple candidate plans at intervals and aggregating them, combined with Step-DPO for efficient stepwise training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT approaches generate entire reasoning chains in one pass, leading to compounding errors (CoT derailment), especially in smaller LMs with limited capacity and long reasoning chains.

Method: Proposes Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA) with plan exploration and aggregation at variable intervals, using a lightweight LoRA module. Introduces online Step-DPO with TSMC for stepwise preference optimization.

Result: Outperforms DeepSeek-R1 distillation and outcome-reward RL baselines on math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks using only 10% SFT data and 5% preference pairs.

Conclusion: MPPA with Step-DPO effectively mitigates CoT derailment through multi-path planning and scalable stepwise supervision, achieving superior performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Acadreason, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs and agents on academic reasoning across 5 domains, showing current models perform poorly with scores below 40.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack sufficient reasoning depth for high-level academic tasks, creating a gap in rigorous benchmarks for complex reasoning.

Method: Created Acadreason benchmark with 50 expert-annotated academic problems across computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy from top-tier publications.

Result: Most LLMs scored below 20 points, GPT-5 achieved only 16 points, and agents performed better but none exceeded 40 points.

Conclusion: There is a significant capability gap between current LLMs/agents and super-intelligent academic research tasks, highlighting the challenges of academic reasoning.

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the
cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher
scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap
between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and
highlights the challenges of Acadreason.

*Chenghao Xiao,Hou Pong Chan,Hao Zhang,Weiwen Xu,Mahani Aljunied,Yu Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-based multimodal embedding approaches excel due to implicit cross-modal alignment from generative pretraining, enabling contrastive learning to refine representations effectively. The proposed LCO-Emb framework achieves SOTA performance and reveals a Generation-Representation Scaling Law linking generative and representational capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MLLM-based multimodal embedding approaches with contrastive learning outperform others, and leverage implicit cross-modal alignment from generative pretraining for better representation learning.

Method: Proposed Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding (LCO-Emb) framework that utilizes implicit cross-modal alignment from MLLM generative pretraining, with contrastive learning as refinement. Analyzed anisotropy and kernel similarity structure to validate latent alignment.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse modalities and benchmarks. Identified Generation-Representation Scaling Law showing representational capabilities scale with generative abilities. Validated on challenging visual-document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Improving generative abilities is an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. Implicit alignment from generative pretraining enables lightweight contrastive refinement, and continual generative pretraining before contrastive learning further boosts embedding capabilities.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

TL;DR: AMA is the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets, addressing gaps in current testing methods by using verified data and diverse agent architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent evaluations in financial trading have limitations: they test models instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on unverified data, making it unclear if agents can reason and adapt in live markets.

Method: Introduces Agent Market Arena (AMA) with verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures. Implements four agents (InvestorAgent, TradeAgent, HedgeFundAgent, DeepFundAgent) and evaluates them across multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, Gemini-2.0-flash) in cryptocurrency and stock markets.

Result: Live experiments show that agent frameworks display distinct behavioral patterns (from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making), while model backbones contribute less to outcome variation.

Conclusion: AMA establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates reinforcement learning for agentic reasoning in LLMs, identifying key design principles for data, algorithms, and reasoning modes that enable smaller models to achieve superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify reinforcement learning in agentic reasoning and establish clear design principles, as current practices remain unclear despite RL's potential to improve LLMs' agentic reasoning abilities.

Method: Comprehensive investigation from three perspectives: data (using real end-to-end tool-use trajectories and high-diversity datasets), algorithm (exploration-friendly techniques like clip higher, reward shaping, and policy entropy), and reasoning mode (deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls).

Result: Achieved strong results on challenging benchmarks (AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, LiveCodeBench-v6) with smaller models - 4B-sized models outperformed 32B-sized models in agentic reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Simple practices in data, algorithms, and reasoning modes consistently enhance agentic reasoning and training efficiency, establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL research while contributing high-quality datasets.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance

*Tsung-Han Wu,Mihran Miroyan,David M. Chan,Trevor Darrell,Narges Norouzi,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LRMs perform well in static settings but fail under dynamic conditions like interruptions and changing context, with performance dropping up to 60% when updates occur late in reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional "frozen world" evaluation of Large Reasoning Models doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where context changes during long reasoning tasks, particularly in applications like assistive programming.

Method: Evaluate LRM robustness under two dynamic scenarios: interruptions (testing partial outputs with limited budget) and dynamic context (testing adaptation to in-flight changes) across mathematics and programming benchmarks requiring long-form reasoning.

Result: Static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness - state-of-the-art LRMs that achieve high accuracy in static settings fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with performance dropping up to 60% when updates are introduced late.

Conclusion: The frozen world assumption breaks down in realistic reasoning tasks, revealing novel failure modes including reasoning leakage, panic under time pressure, and self-doubt when incorporating updated information.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

Motivation: Early MRI signs of Batten disease are subtle and often missed, requiring an AI solution for early detection with limited training cases.

Method: Distill a large teacher ViT into a 5M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tune using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with 5-shot episodes). Integrate Grad-CAM for explainable predictions.

Result: Achieves ~91% accuracy and AUC ≥0.95 on multi-site dataset of 79 Batten-disease MRIs and 90 controls. Outperforms 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baselines with sensitivity >90% and specificity ~90%.

Conclusion: The model's small size and strong performance demonstrate a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection with explainable predictions.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited data availability and data confidence in medical image analysis, where existing methods like Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning show good accuracy but struggle with data scarcity.

### [160] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT), a method that learns compact, transferable action representations to improve efficiency in auto-regressive Vision-Language-Action models by shortening training sequences and reducing target entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-regressive VLA models face efficiency issues with extended high-dimensional action sequences. Prior compression methods struggled with poor reconstruction or inefficient compression, motivating the development of a better action tokenization approach.

Method: OmniSAT normalizes value ranges and temporal horizons with B-Spline encoding, then applies multi-stage residual quantization to position, rotation, and gripper subspaces to produce compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity. It also includes cross-embodiment learning using unified action-pattern space from robot and human demonstrations.

Result: The tokenization shortens training sequences by 6.8× and lowers target entropy. It achieves higher compression while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training convergence and improved model performance across diverse real-robot and simulation experiments.

Conclusion: OmniSAT provides an effective solution for efficient action representation in VLA models, offering better compression and reconstruction quality than previous methods while enabling scalable learning from heterogeneous demonstrations.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAMamba is a novel knowledge-aware Mamba model for MODIS change detection that addresses mixed pixels, information coupling, and background heterogeneity through knowledge-driven transitions, multi-task learning, and specialized Mamba modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS change detection faces challenges including mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information coupling effects, and background class heterogeneity, which limit detection accuracy.

Method: Proposes KAMamba with: 1) Knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided approach with KAT-loss, 2) Multi-task learning with PreC-loss, PostC-loss, and Chg-loss, 3) SSTMamba modules to disentangle information coupling, 4) SDMamba backbone for efficiency.

Result: On MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada: 1.5-6% gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Conclusion: KAMamba effectively addresses MODIS change detection challenges through knowledge-aware transitions, multi-task learning, and specialized Mamba architectures, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNDM integrates NN-UNet with diffusion models to improve brain tumor segmentation in MRI by refining masks through iterative denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN models like U-Net struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and limited data diversity in brain tumor segmentation.

Method: Hybrid framework combining NN-UNet's feature extraction with diffusion models that learn residual error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks through iterative denoising.

Result: Superior performance on BraTS 2021 datasets with improvements in Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics, enhanced robustness across modalities and tumor subregions.

Conclusion: NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing automated brain tumor analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel micro-expression recognition method using two complementary dynamic image representations and an adaptive fusion network that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions reveal genuine emotions but are subtle and hard to detect, making them valuable for lie detection, behavioral analysis, and psychological assessment.

Method: Proposes two representations: Temporal-ranked dynamic image (emphasizes temporal progression) and Motion-intensity dynamic image (highlights subtle motions via frame reordering). Uses an Adaptive fusion network to optimally integrate these representations.

Result: Achieved 93.95% Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II (new SOTA), 82.47% Accuracy and 0.665 UF1 on SAMM, and 76.00% Accuracy on MMEW, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: Both the input representations and proposed architecture significantly improve micro-expression recognition performance, providing a foundation for applications in affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper provides the first comprehensive review of Connected Vision Systems (CVS) that integrates multi-view multi-camera tracking, re-identification, and action understanding into a unified framework, addressing gaps in existing literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

There's a need for unified understanding of CVS that addresses real-world challenges like occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability.

Method: The authors propose a unique taxonomy dividing CVS into four key components: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, action understanding, and combined methods. They systematically review state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The paper outlines key research directions for enhancing CVS robustness, efficiency, and adaptability in complex real-world applications, aiming to inspire innovative solutions for next-generation intelligent and adaptive CVS.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp is a lightweight method that uses cross-modal attention to warp input images, reallocating resolution to query-relevant regions while preserving global context, improving MLLM performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding.

Method: Uses MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of input images, reallocating spatial resolution toward important regions without changing model weights or architecture.

Result: Consistently improves accuracy across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Attention-guided warping prioritizes query-relevant information while preserving context, and MLLMs perform better with such warped inputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what makes multimodal language learning effective - specifically which image-text features and learner backgrounds help infer unfamiliar word meanings.

Method: Conducted studies with human participants using different image-text pairs, analyzing features that make word inference easier and correlating language backgrounds with success.

Result: Found only some intuitive features strongly correlate with performance, suggesting need for better predictive features. AI systems show promise but need improvement in reasoning about participant performance.

Conclusion: The study reveals gaps in understanding predictive features for multimodal language learning success and identifies promising directions for improving AI reasoning about learner performance.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to determine optimal image resolution for vision-language tasks and adapts VLLMs to these resolutions using parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLLMs use fixed resolutions for all tasks, leading to suboptimal performance since different vision-language tasks require varying levels of perceptual granularity.

Method: 1) Analyze resolution preferences across tasks using image complexity and VLLM uncertainty variance; 2) Develop empirical formula for optimal resolution; 3) Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to adapt VLLMs to optimal resolutions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively improves performance across various vision-language tasks by using task-specific optimal resolutions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses resolution mismatch in VLLMs and enhances performance by adapting models to task-specific optimal resolutions through systematic analysis and parameter-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image segmentation outputs from satellite images often lack clarity due to low quality features, necessitating better CRF models to achieve clearer segmentation results.

Method: Experimented with various types of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and evaluated their performance on two datasets: low-quality satellite imagery and high-quality aerial photographs, comparing different CRF approaches.

Result: The study identified which CRF models perform best on different types of imagery and revealed the strengths and limitations of various CRF approaches for image segmentation.

Conclusion: Different CRF models have varying effectiveness depending on image quality, with some performing better on low-quality satellite images while others excel on high-quality aerial photographs, highlighting the need for context-appropriate CRF selection.

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on

TL;DR: Using synthetic face data can improve Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) when carefully incorporated, but indiscriminate use or relying solely on synthetic data leads to sub-optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and limitations in obtaining large-scale bona fide image datasets for S-MAD by exploring synthetic face data alternatives.

Method: Used various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes with incremental testing protocol to assess generalization as synthetic images were added.

Result: Generalization improves with controlled synthetic image incorporation or gradual bona fide image addition, but synthetic-only approaches achieve highest Equal Error Rate.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can enhance S-MAD when used strategically, but should not be the sole data source due to performance degradation in operational scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ceb is a novel cell instance segmentation method that uses boundary features instead of pixel-wise objectives to better preserve geometric properties of cells, achieving competitive performance with SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL methods use pixel-wise objectives that lose important geometric properties like shape and curvature. Ceb addresses this by leveraging boundary features to better represent cell instances.

Method: Ceb extracts potential boundaries using revised Watershed algorithm, constructs boundary signatures by sampling pixels from foreground-foreground and background-foreground boundaries, uses a boundary classifier to predict boundary labels, and divides/merges regions based on predicted boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps and achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance segmentation methods.

Conclusion: Ceb successfully addresses the limitation of pixel-wise objectives by using boundary features, demonstrating superior performance in cell instance segmentation while preserving important geometric properties.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

### [171] [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867)
*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPEL is a framework that improves vision-language model performance by clustering context prompts and ensembling in logits space rather than feature space, with cluster-preserving regularization and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features shifts class centroids away from true distributions, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) classifies images into class clusters with distinct prompts, ensembles in logits space, uses cluster-preserving regularization, and adaptive prompt weighting.

Result: The method better aligns with visual feature distribution and maintains cluster-specific discriminative power.

Conclusion: CAPEL provides more effective prompt ensembling that preserves cluster nature and achieves robust performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

### [172] [Fast Self-Supervised depth and mask aware Association for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09878)
*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-object tracking method that uses depth and mask features with a self-supervised encoder for object representation, avoiding expensive segmentation IoU computation while achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOT methods rely on IoU for association, which becomes unreliable with similar/occluded objects and is computationally expensive for segmentation masks.

Method: Fuses depth and mask features through a compact self-supervised encoder to create stable object representations, using them alongside bounding box IoU and re-ID features for matching. Uses zero-shot depth estimator and promptable segmentation model for spatial cues.

Result: Outperforms TBD state-of-the-art on challenging benchmarks (SportsMOT, DanceTrack) with non-linear motion and occlusion, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks (MOT17).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of IoU-based tracking by leveraging depth and mask features through self-supervised learning, providing robust object representations for MOT without expensive segmentation IoU computation.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing

### [174] [Geometry-Aware Scene Configurations for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09880)
*Minkwan Kim,Changwoon Choi,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scene-adaptive strategies for efficient representation capacity allocation in indoor environment generation from incomplete observations, using geometric priors and adaptive basis placement to improve NeRF performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scenes with multiple rooms have irregular layouts with varying complexity, clutter, occlusion, and flat walls, requiring efficient use of limited resources for immersive experience generation.

Method: Use geometric priors from pre-processing to guide optimal basis placement instead of uniform arrangements, and employ scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for geometric deficiencies in input trajectories.

Result: Significant enhancements in rendering quality and memory requirements compared to baselines using regular placements, demonstrated through comprehensive analysis in large-scale indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Scene-adaptive strategies with geometric guidance effectively improve NeRF representations for indoor environments by optimizing resource allocation and compensating for input limitations.

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

### [175] [LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881)
*Minkwan Kim,Seungmin Lee,Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTGS is a novel scene representation that models long-term scene chronology from sparse-view captures using Gaussian splatting, enabling efficient reconstruction of everyday environments despite frequent changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current novel-view synthesis methods struggle with everyday environments captured casually due to frequent scene changes that require dense spatial and temporal observations, which are impractical for casual use.

Method: Uses template Gaussians as structural priors for shared object tracks, with a refinement pipeline that adapts these priors to temporal variations using few-shot observations. The framework generalizes across time steps through simple transformations.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to baselines while enabling fast and lightweight updates. Validated on real-world datasets collected specifically for evaluating long-term scene changes with sparse captures.

Conclusion: LTGS provides an efficient and scalable solution for modeling temporal evolution of 3D environments from highly under-constrained casual captures, significantly improving practicality for everyday scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

*Lenny Aharon,Keemin Lee,Karan Sikka,Selmaan Chettih,Cole Hurwitz,Liam Paninski,Matthew R Whiteway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive framework for multi-view animal pose estimation that combines novel training techniques, post-processing methods, and model distillation to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and improved uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view pose estimation methods struggle with limited labeled data and poor uncertainty estimates, which hinders reliable animal behavior quantification in scientific research.

Method: Uses multi-view transformer (MVT) with pretrained backbones and patch masking for cross-view correspondence, incorporates geometric consistency via 3D augmentation and triangulation loss, extends Ensemble Kalman Smoother for nonlinear cases with variance inflation, and employs distillation using improved EKS predictions for pseudo-label generation.

Result: Framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component providing complementary benefits for reliable pose estimation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

TL;DR: Developed a deep learning architecture integrating hyperspectral imaging into UAV perception using a modified Mobile 3D Vision Transformer with SpectralCA block for enhanced navigation, object detection, and terrain classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for UAVs operating in complex environments where conventional navigation fails due to interference, poor visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging enables fine-grained material recognition critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

Method: Modified Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing SpectralCA block that uses bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, reducing parameters and inference time while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Experimental evaluation on WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset showed improved UAV perception efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring tasks as measured by Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and Kappa coefficient.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully enhances UAV perception capabilities by integrating hyperspectral imaging with deep learning, making it suitable for real-time applications in complex environments where conventional methods fail.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,

### [178] [HeadsUp! High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09924)
*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeadsUp is a single-step diffusion model for portrait image super-resolution that handles both faces and backgrounds seamlessly in one model, eliminating blending artifacts from traditional multi-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing super-resolution methods require separate models for faces and backgrounds, causing blending artifacts. Human perception is particularly sensitive to facial fidelity, so a unified approach is needed.

Method: Built on single-step diffusion model with face supervision mechanism for facial focus, reference-based mechanism for identity restoration, and trained on new PortraitSR-4K dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait super-resolution while maintaining comparable performance on general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: HeadsUp provides an effective end-to-end solution for portrait super-resolution that eliminates blending artifacts and handles both facial regions and backgrounds seamlessly.

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

*Nilesh Jain,Elie Alhajjar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using denoising diffusion models and Controlnet to enhance underwater image datasets by adding diverse image types and improving image quality for better marine ecosystem studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images are crucial for ocean research but suffer from poor quality due to complex environments. Existing datasets lack diversity, contain only monocular images, and have quality issues that limit research effectiveness.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Use denoising diffusion models to expand datasets with diverse image types (stereo, wide-angled, macro, close-up), 2) Apply Controlnet to enhance image quality and evaluate dataset improvements.

Result: The proposed methods aim to create more comprehensive and higher quality underwater image datasets that better represent different lighting conditions and viewing angles.

Conclusion: Expanding dataset diversity and enhancing image quality through diffusion models and Controlnet can significantly improve underwater image analysis and marine ecosystem studies.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

*Agampreet Aulakh,Nils D. Forkert,Matthias Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model brain aging trajectories from longitudinal MRI data, achieving 81.3% classification accuracy for distinguishing healthy vs dementia-like aging patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal MRI data has discrete sampling with varying spatial/temporal patterns across individuals, making it challenging for traditional deep learning methods to represent continuous biological aging processes.

Method: Developed a novel INR architecture that partially disentangles spatial and temporal parameters, creating continuous functions from discrete MRI data, with a framework operating directly on INR parameter space for classification.

Result: Achieved 81.3% accuracy in brain aging trajectory classification with irregular sampling, outperforming standard deep learning baseline (73.7%) in simulated data of 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects.

Conclusion: INR-based approach effectively models continuous brain aging trajectories from irregularly sampled longitudinal MRI data, providing superior classification performance for distinguishing pathological aging patterns.

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

*Pouya Shaeri,Ryan T. Woo,Yasaman Mohammadpour,Ariane Middel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-in-the-loop interactive framework for segmentation that uses human corrections as interventional signals to steer models away from spurious correlations and toward robust features, improving accuracy and reducing annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations rather than true object boundaries, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Interactive framework where human corrections serve as interventional signals to identify when models rely on superficial features. The system propagates correction-informed edits across visually similar images to systematically correct failure modes.

Result: Improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15% relative improvement) on cubemap data, with 3-4× reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining while maintaining competitive benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for building segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world applications like urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

*Pan Wang,Yihao Hu,Xiaodong Bai,Aiping Yang,Xiangxiang Li,Meiping Ding,Jianguo Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-strategy framework for automated Shatian pomelo detection that addresses challenges in imaging devices, lighting conditions, scale variation, and occlusion through specialized dataset construction, data augmentation, and the REAS-Det network with enhanced receptive fields and occlusion handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shatian pomelo requires automated detection for accurate quantity assessment and lean production, but existing methods degrade in real-world conditions due to imaging devices, lighting, scale variation, and occlusion challenges.

Method: Proposes a multi-strategy framework using: 1) STP-AgriData dataset combining real orchard and internet-sourced images, 2) Data augmentation for lighting variations, 3) REAS-Det network with RFAConv and C3RFEM modules for scale variation, and MultiSEAM with soft-NMS for occlusion handling.

Result: Achieved precision of 87.6%, recall of 74.9%, mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%, demonstrating superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art detection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-strategy framework effectively addresses real-world challenges in Shatian pomelo detection and shows promising results for automated agricultural product detection applications.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

*Salma J. Ahmed,Emad A. Mohammed,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: J-RAS is a joint training method that combines segmentation and retrieval models to improve medical image segmentation by leveraging retrieved image-mask pairs for better anatomical understanding and boundary delineation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual medical image segmentation is time-consuming and variable, while AI methods require large annotated datasets and struggle with generalization across diverse imaging conditions and rare cases.

Method: Joint training of segmentation and retrieval models where both are optimized together, enabling the segmentation model to use retrieved image-mask pairs and the retrieval model to learn segmentation-relevant features beyond visual similarity.

Result: J-RAS consistently improves performance across multiple segmentation backbones (U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, SegFormer) on ACDC and M&Ms datasets. On ACDC, SegFormer with J-RAS improved Dice score from 0.8708±0.042 to 0.9115±0.031 and reduced Hausdorff Distance from 1.8130±2.49 to 1.1489±0.30.

Conclusion: J-RAS effectively enhances segmentation performance by integrating retrieval mechanisms that provide meaningful contextual cues, demonstrating strong generalizability across different architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: An AI framework using existing traffic cameras for large-scale traffic monitoring, featuring fine-tuned YOLOv11 for vehicle detection, graph-based viewpoint normalization, and LLM-powered automated summaries, validated on NYC congestion pricing rollout data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for scalable traffic monitoring during disruptions like natural disasters and policy changes, with limitations in sensor deployment costs and existing video analytics' struggles with dynamic viewpoints and massive data volumes.

Method: End-to-end AI framework with fine-tuned YOLOv11 for real-time traffic density/classification, graph-based viewpoint normalization for camera inconsistencies, and domain-specific LLM for automated data summarization from 24/7 video streams.

Result: Validated on 9M+ images from 1,000 NYC cameras during congestion pricing rollout: 9% weekday passenger vehicle decline in Congestion Relief Zone, early truck reductions with rebound signs, and increased pedestrian/cyclist activity at multiple scales.

Conclusion: Framework demonstrates practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention, showing improved LLM accuracy with example-based prompts.

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

### [185] [FlareX: A Physics-Informed Dataset for Lens Flare Removal via 2D Synthesis and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09995)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FlareX, a physics-informed flare dataset with 2D templates and 3D rendering to address generalization issues in lens flare removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flare datasets use synthetic 2D overlays that lack diversity and ignore physical principles, limiting real-world generalization of trained models.

Method: Three-stage physics-informed generation: parameterized template creation, illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D rendering, plus a masking approach for real-world flare-free images.

Result: Created FlareX dataset with 9,500 2D templates from 95 patterns and 3,000 flare pairs from 60 3D scenes, enabling better real-world performance measurement.

Conclusion: The proposed method and FlareX dataset effectively address flare removal challenges and demonstrate improved performance through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

### [186] [BurstDeflicker: A Benchmark Dataset for Flicker Removal in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09996)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Shihao Zhou,Yaqi Luo,Jie Liang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BurstDeflicker is a scalable benchmark for flicker removal that combines synthetic data generation, real-world image capture, and a green-screen method to create a comprehensive dataset addressing the lack of large-scale flicker data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker artifacts from AC-powered lighting and rolling shutter cameras degrade image quality and affect high-level computer vision tasks. The lack of large-scale realistic datasets has hindered flicker removal research.

Method: Three complementary data acquisition strategies: 1) Retinex-based synthesis pipeline for controllable flicker generation, 2) 4000 real-world flicker images from different scenes, 3) Green-screen method to incorporate motion while preserving real flicker degradation.

Result: Created a comprehensive benchmark dataset that enables better understanding of flicker characteristics and improves model generalization to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The BurstDeflicker dataset effectively addresses the data scarcity problem in flicker removal research and demonstrates potential to advance the field through comprehensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

*Yanyuan Chen,Dexuan Xu,Yu Huang,Songkun Zhan,Hanpin Wang,Dongxue Chen,Xueping Wang,Meikang Qiu,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIMO is a unified medical vision language model that addresses limitations in existing models by incorporating visual referring multimodal input and pixel grounding multimodal output, enabling better understanding of medical images and grounding of medical terminologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical vision language models only use text instructions without direct visual understanding, and provide text answers without connecting to key image areas, limiting their effectiveness in medical applications.

Method: Proposed MIMO model with visual referring multimodal input and pixel grounding multimodal output, along with MIMOSeg dataset containing 895K samples covering instruction following and complex QA with multimodal input/output.

Result: Extensive experiments show MIMO uniquely combines visual referring and pixel grounding capabilities not available in previous models, demonstrating effectiveness on various medical multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: MIMO successfully addresses the limitations of existing models by providing unified multimodal input/output capabilities for medical vision language tasks, with the comprehensive MIMOSeg dataset enabling robust training and evaluation.

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

### [188] [Q-Adapter: Visual Query Adapter for Extracting Textually-related Features in Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10022)
*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Adapter is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for video captioning that introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer to enhance visual feature extraction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 1.4% of parameters compared to full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard full fine-tuning of large pretrained models for video captioning is computationally prohibitive, and existing PEFT methods primarily focus on language components while lacking sufficient understanding of visual information during fine-tuning.

Method: Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into the Vision Encoder to enable effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features without external textual supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among PEFT methods on MSR-VTT and MSVD datasets across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics, and competitive performance with full fine-tuning methods using only 1.4% of parameters.

Conclusion: Q-Adapter demonstrates strong potential in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, showing scalability for video-language modeling while providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

*Henan Wang,Hanxin Zhu,Xinliang Gong,Tianyu He,Xin Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS is a compressed dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting representation that achieves up to 90x compression while maintaining state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and fast rendering speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic 3DGS algorithms overlook substantial temporal and spatial redundancies in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption that needs to be addressed.

Method: Uses 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction inspired by video compression techniques, combined with adaptive quantization and context-based entropy coding to reduce storage requirements.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with fastest rendering speed and remarkably low storage footprint (~1MB average), achieving 40x compression on synthetic scenes and 90x compression on real-world scenes.

Conclusion: P-4DGS successfully addresses memory consumption issues in dynamic 3DGS while maintaining superior performance, making it highly practical for compact 4D scene modeling.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

*Sitong Gong,Yunzhi Zhuge,Lu Zhang,Pingping Zhang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCFormer is a novel Transformer-based framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation that enhances cross-modal complementarity through parallel bilateral architecture, multi-query transformers for spatial-temporal modeling, and bi-modal contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with extracting multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics adequately. CNN approaches have limited receptive fields, while Transformer methods typically fail to capture comprehensive spatial-temporal context.

Method: Proposes CCFormer with three key components: Early Integration Module for multi-scale visual-audio fusion, Multi-query Transformer Module for spatial-temporal modeling with dynamic audio queries, and Bi-modal Contrastive Learning for modality alignment.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance across S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets, demonstrating superior segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: CCFormer effectively processes both local and global information while capturing comprehensive spatial-temporal context, setting new benchmarks in Audio-Visual Segmentation through its complementary and contrastive design.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTAR is a medical vision-language model that mimics human expert diagnostic reasoning through iterative "think-act-rethink-answer" cycles, outperforming state-of-the-art models by focusing on clinically critical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs use single-pass reasoning and miss localized visual cues, while human experts iteratively scan and refine regions of interest before diagnosis. ViTAR aims to bridge this machine-human perception gap.

Method: ViTAR uses a cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer" to treat medical images as interactive objects. It employs a two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. A curated dataset of 1K interactive examples and 16K VQA data supports the approach.

Result: ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis shows it increasingly anchors to clinically critical regions from "think" to "rethink" rounds and maintains high attention to visual tokens during reasoning.

Conclusion: Embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI, providing mechanistic insight into improved diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DREAM, a comprehensive benchmark for deepfake visual realism assessment that measures how realistic deepfakes appear to humans, including a diverse dataset, large-scale human annotations, and evaluation of 16 assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deepfake detection has received attention, the subjective perception and computational modeling of deepfake visual realism remains understudied. This is important for evaluating deepfake quality, deceptiveness, and potential impact on society.

Method: Created the DREAM benchmark with a diverse deepfake video dataset, collected 140,000 realism scores and textual descriptions from 3,500 human annotators, and evaluated 16 realism assessment methods including large vision-language models and a new description-aligned CLIP method.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive benchmark that can serve as foundation for future research in deepfake realism assessment and related areas, providing large-scale human-annotated data and systematic evaluation of assessment methods.

Conclusion: The DREAM benchmark addresses the gap in computational modeling of deepfake visual realism and lays groundwork for future research in assessing deepfake quality and deceptiveness, with potential applications in improving deepfake generation and predicting their societal impact.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

TL;DR: CLSL is a collaborative learning method for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels that simultaneously addresses semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery in a unified framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels faces two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery, which need to be addressed together for better performance.

Method: Proposes a collaborative learning framework with three modules: semantic-related feature learning to discover semantic information and label correlations, semantic-guided feature enhancement to align visual and semantic features, and collaborative learning that integrates feature learning and label recovery in a mutually reinforced loop.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that CLSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels.

Conclusion: The proposed CLSL method effectively addresses the challenges of incomplete labels in multi-label image recognition by unifying semantic-aware feature learning and label recovery in a collaborative framework, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHG-MAE is a novel model that combines neural graphs with masked autoencoders, enabling multi-modal learning through random masking of entire modalities and unifying pre-training with fine-tuning in a single training loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage self-supervised pre-training methods like MAE for multi-modal scenarios without requiring labeled data, and to create a unified framework that combines classical neural graphs with modern masked autoencoders.

Method: Random masking of entire modalities (not just patches) to sample from hyper-edge distributions, combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop, and enabling inference-time ensembles with knowledge distillation.

Result: The approach enables creation of ensembles that boost prediction performance and consistency, with knowledge distillation working effectively even on models with fewer than 1M parameters.

Conclusion: PHG-MAE provides an effective framework for multi-modal learning that can be applied to various domains like UAV scenes, autonomous driving, and indoor robotics, with publicly released code and datasets.

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using vision foundation models to track spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars by transforming discrete optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences for continuous monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies focus on single-phase or pre/post-failure dual-phase landslide identification, making it challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars needed for understanding evolution mechanisms and failure precursors.

Method: Proposes a universal framework that reconstructs discrete optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences, enabling vision foundation models (developed for video segmentation) to track landslide scar evolution through knowledge-guided auto-propagation and interactive refinement.

Result: Validated on Baige landslide (post-failure) and Sela landslide (2017-2025), the framework successfully enables continuous tracking of landslide scars, capturing both failure precursors for early warning and post-failure evolution for assessing secondary hazards.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for continuous spatiotemporal tracking of landslide scars, supporting both early warning through precursor detection and long-term stability assessment through post-failure evolution monitoring.

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat is a 3DGS-based framework for robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images, overcoming limitations of NeRF and 3DGS that require accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF and 3DGS depend heavily on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage, limiting their applicability in sparse-view settings where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient.

Method: Uses VGGT foundation model for reliable initial poses and dense point clouds; integrates hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization, graph-guided attribute refinement, and flow-based depth regularization.

Result: Achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Conclusion: Gesplat enables effective 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from sparse unposed images, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

### [197] [Cooperative Pseudo Labeling for Unsupervised Federated Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10100)
*Kuangpu Guo,Lijun Sheng,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Zilei Wang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedCoPL extends unsupervised federated learning to classification tasks using CLIP, addressing global class imbalance through pseudo label distribution adjustment and partial prompt aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous UFL works focused on representation learning and clustering, but CLIP's zero-shot capabilities enable classification in UFL, which remains largely unexplored.

Method: FedCoPL: clients estimate pseudo label distributions, server adjusts them to avoid global imbalance, and uses partial prompt aggregation (aggregate visual prompts, keep text prompts local).

Result: Extensive experiments show FedCoPL achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FedCoPL successfully enables classification in unsupervised federated learning using CLIP, with effective handling of class imbalance through cooperative pseudo labeling and personalized prompt strategies.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

### [198] [Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10104)
*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ACRE (Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning), a method that improves reasoning-answer consistency in multimodal LLMs by adding an auxiliary consistency check to the GRPO algorithm, achieving 2.2% and 1.5% improvements on video and math reasoning tasks respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RLVR improves answer accuracy in multimodal LLMs, it often leads to inconsistency between reasoning traces and final answers, with standard GRPO showing only 79.7% consistency on MMVU tasks.

Method: ACRE modifies GRPO by adding a consistency check: after generating reasoning and initial answer, answer options are shuffled and the model is prompted again with the same reasoning to predict a second answer. A consistency-verification reward is given only if both answers agree and are correct.

Result: ACRE achieves average improvements of 2.2% on Video Reasoning benchmarks and 1.5% on multimodal math reasoning benchmarks over the GRPO baseline, while improving reasoning-answer consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed ACRE method effectively addresses reasoning-answer inconsistency in multimodal LLMs by enforcing consistency through auxiliary verification, leading to improved performance on challenging reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

### [199] [Uncertainty-Aware Post-Detection Framework for Enhanced Fire and Smoke Detection in Compact Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10108)
*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using statistical uncertainty and visual cues to improve fire/smoke detection in compact deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compact deep learning models for fire/smoke detection suffer from false positives and missed detections, while conventional post-detection methods like NMS rely only on spatial overlap and can suppress true positives.

Method: A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model.

Result: Experiments on D-Fire dataset show improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines with modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: Post-detection rescoring effectively enhances the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

TL;DR: ICFC is a training-free framework using multi-modal LLMs for interpretable image manipulation localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image tampering poses security threats, but supervised methods need costly pixel-level annotations while existing alternatives underperform and lack interpretability.

Method: Uses In-Context Forensic Chain with objectified rule construction, adaptive filtering for knowledge base, and multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline mimicking expert workflows.

Result: Surpasses training-free methods and achieves competitive/superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICFC enables systematic MLLM reasoning for classification, localization, and interpretability without training, offering effective forensic analysis.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

*Yuxi Mi,Qiuyang Yuan,Zhizhou Zhong,Xuan Zhao,Jiaogen Zhou,Fubao Zhu,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImmerIris is a large-scale VR headset-collected dataset for off-axis iris recognition, showing current methods fail due to normalization issues and proposing a normalization-free approach that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immersive iris recognition in AR/VR applications faces challenges from off-axis acquisition (perspective distortion, quality degradation, intra-class variations), but datasets capturing these challenges are scarce.

Method: Created ImmerIris dataset (499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects) via VR headsets, and proposed a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from ocular images without complex normalization steps.

Result: Current methods designed for on-axis imagery perform poorly on immersive setup due to fallible normalization. The proposed normalization-free approach consistently outperforms normalization-based counterparts.

Conclusion: Normalization-free paradigm shows promise for robust immersive iris recognition, pointing to a new direction that avoids the limitations of traditional normalization-based methods in off-axis scenarios.

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

*Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Najmul Hassan,Md Maruf Al Hossain,Yuichi Okuyama,Jungpil Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning framework combining CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms for multi-class Parkinson's disease severity classification using finger tapping video features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gesture-based PD recognition systems have unsatisfactory accuracy, and accurate PD severity evaluation is crucial for clinical management and intervention development.

Method: Collected finger tapping videos, extracted temporal, frequency, and amplitude features from wrist/hand movements, and built a hybrid model with Conv1D MaxPooling for spatial features, BiLSTM for temporal dynamics, attention mechanism for feature selection, and concatenated CNN-BiLSTM outputs with dense layers for classification.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between five PD severity classes, showing improved automated PD severity detection.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial-temporal representations with attention mechanisms provides a promising non-invasive tool to support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

*Halil Hüseyin Çalışkan,Talha Koruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet is a lightweight architecture for low-light image enhancement and super-resolution, achieving high SSIM/PSNR scores with significantly fewer parameters than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoencoder methods for low-light image enhancement suffer from low SSIM/PSNR scores and high computational requirements due to large parameter counts. Similarly, GAN-based super-resolution methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Developed DeepFusionNet architecture - a lightweight autoencoder-based approach for both low-light enhancement and super-resolution tasks. The low-light enhancement version has ~2.5M parameters, while the super-resolution version has only ~100K parameters.

Result: For low-light enhancement on LOL-v1 dataset: SSIM 92.8%, PSNR 26.30. For super-resolution: PSNR 25.30, SSIM 80.7% on validation set. Both achieved with significantly fewer parameters than existing methods.

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet provides an efficient solution for real-time image enhancement tasks, offering high performance with reduced computational requirements, making it suitable for applications requiring fast image processing.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi is suitable for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments and has potential for broader precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D is a framework for colorizing static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, enabling diverse color reconstructions with user control while maintaining cross-view and cross-time consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene colorization focus only on static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations, which sacrifices chromatic richness and controllability.

Method: The method colorizes a single key view and fine-tunes a personalized colorizer to propagate colors to novel views and time steps. It uses a scene-specific deterministic color mapping and reconstructs colorful 3D scenes with Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Color3D delivers more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Color3D successfully recasts complex 3D colorization as a single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability.

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix is a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing that combines a ReMix Module for semantic feature editing and IP-ControlNet for pixel-level consistency and pose controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to unify character generation and editing in a single framework - generation approaches lack fine-grained identity consistency, while editing methods lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment.

Method: ReMix uses two components: (1) ReMix Module leverages MLLMs to edit semantic features and adapt instruction embeddings to DiT backbone without fine-tuning, (2) IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic/layout cues and introduces an ε-equivariant latent space for joint denoising in shared noise space.

Result: ReMix supports personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis while maintaining character consistency and spatial controllability.

Conclusion: ReMix provides an effective and efficient unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaFiRe is a novel framework for Referring Image Segmentation that handles ambiguous expressions through a two-phase cognitive process, using Mamba's scan-then-update property for efficient multi-cycle refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RIS methods focus on simple expressions and reduce the problem to keyword matching, failing to handle referential ambiguity in real-world scenarios like object-distracting and category-implicit expressions.

Method: Proposes SaFiRe framework that mimics human two-phase cognition: global understanding followed by detail-oriented inspection, leveraging Mamba's scan-then-update property for efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard and proposed aRefCOCO benchmark demonstrate SaFiRe's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in handling ambiguous referring expressions.

Conclusion: SaFiRe effectively addresses the limitations of current RIS methods by handling ambiguous expressions through a cognitive-inspired two-phase approach, with Mamba enabling efficient refinement cycles.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: SparseUWSeg is a framework for underwater semantic segmentation that uses active sampling to guide annotation and hybrid label propagation combining SAM2 and superpixels, achieving +5% mIoU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained underwater scene analysis is challenging due to high cost of dense expert annotations, while sparse point-labels are easier but introduce annotation and propagation challenges.

Method: Active sampling strategy to guide annotators, plus hybrid label propagation leveraging both SAM2 and superpixel-based methods.

Result: Achieves up to +5% mIoU improvement over D+NN on two diverse underwater datasets.

Conclusion: Main contribution is the design and release of an interactive annotation tool that enables ecology researchers to efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks using foundation models and computer vision.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

Motivation: Existing concept-based models treat concepts as numerical attributes without visual explanations, limiting their utility in real-world applications like medical use-cases where visual localization is crucial.

Method: Proposes ViConEx-Med framework using multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept tokens to produce concept-level localization maps.

Result: Outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in both concept detection and localization precision on synthetic and real-world medical datasets.

Conclusion: ViConEx-Med represents a promising direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts, with publicly available code for further research.

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

### [211] [HccePose(BF): Predicting Front \& Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10177)
*Yulin Wang,Mengting Hu,Hongli Li,Chen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel pose estimation method that predicts 3D coordinates for both front and back surfaces of objects and densely samples between them to create ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, improving pose estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods focus only on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior. This limits the utilization of the full object geometry for more accurate pose estimation.

Method: The method predicts 3D coordinates for both front and back surfaces, densely samples coordinates between them to create ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, and uses Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) for more accurate and efficient representation of surface coordinates.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across seven classic BOP core datasets on the BOP website.

Conclusion: By leveraging both front and back surfaces with dense interior sampling and using HCCE encoding, the method achieves superior pose estimation accuracy compared to current approaches that only utilize front surface information.

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

*Zixu Zhao,Yang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DVTMD, a new drone video-text dataset with fine-grained captions, and proposes TCMA framework for text-video retrieval that achieves state-of-the-art performance in drone domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs generate massive aerial videos requiring efficient content retrieval, but existing datasets have coarse captions and the drone domain remains underexplored for text-video retrieval.

Method: Constructed DVTMD dataset with 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained captions. Proposed TCMA framework with multi-granularity alignment, word/patch selection module, and text-adaptive dynamic temperature mechanism.

Result: Achieved 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval on DVTMD, establishing first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and TCMA framework effectively address drone video-text retrieval challenges, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods and providing a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pseudo-balancing is a semi-supervised method that improves gender classification fairness by enforcing demographic balance during pseudo-label selection using only unlabeled race-balanced data, achieving 6.53% accuracy improvement and 44.17% gender gap reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic biases from training data, leading to uneven performance across gender and racial subgroups.

Method: Pseudo-balancing enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection using only unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring ground-truth annotations. Evaluated through fine-tuning biased classifiers and stress-testing with imbalanced training data.

Result: 79.81% overall accuracy (6.53% improvement over baseline), reduces gender accuracy gap by 44.17%, and narrows East Asian subgroup gap from over 49% to just 5.01%.

Conclusion: Even without label supervision, access to demographically balanced unlabeled datasets can effectively debias computer vision models while preserving or enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

*Feng Xiao,Hongbin Xu,Hai Ci,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding that extends from binary to n-ary relationships to better handle complex spatial descriptions in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods only model pairwise object relationships, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding, which is crucial for distinguishing similar objects using natural language descriptions.

Method: Proposed a progressive relational learning framework that extends relational learning from binary to n-ary, uses grouped supervision loss for n-ary relational learning, and employs a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms within scene graphs created with n-ary relationships.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, demonstrating advantages of n-ary relational perception in 3D localization.

Conclusion: The n-ary relational perception approach significantly improves 3D object grounding performance by better capturing global spatial relationships described in natural language.

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

TL;DR: CerS-Path is a cervical subspecialty pathology diagnostic system that uses two-stage pretraining (self-supervised learning on 190M tissue patches and multimodal enhancement with 2.5M image-text pairs) to support eight diagnostic functions, achieving 99.38% screening sensitivity and excellent generalizability across multiple centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer requires complex histopathological assessments, but current deep learning models lack accuracy and generalizability, while general foundation models fail to capture subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability.

Method: Two synergistic pretraining stages: (1) self-supervised learning on ~190M tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build cervical-specific feature extractor, (2) multimodal enhancement with 2.5M image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream diagnostic functions.

Result: CerS-Path supports eight diagnostic functions including rare cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, surpassing prior foundation models. Prospective testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintained 99.38% screening sensitivity and excellent generalizability.

Conclusion: CerS-Path represents a significant advance in cervical pathology with potential for subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening, demonstrating superior clinical applicability and generalizability.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

TL;DR: Proposes SEDD metric and framework to quantify synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving perception systems using style embeddings and metric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world testing is impractical, synthetic datasets offer cost-effective alternatives but suffer from domain gap. Quantifying this gap is essential for evaluating dataset utility and improving training pipelines.

Method: Systematic framework combining Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and sim-to-real methods show the method effectively quantifies synthetic-to-real gap, providing a standardized quality control tool.

Conclusion: The work enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing data-driven autonomous driving systems development.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images often contain subtle semantic anomalies that compromise plausibility, making semantic-level anomaly detection essential for assessing AIGC trustworthiness.

Method: Created AnomReason benchmark with quadruple annotations (Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity) using AnomAgent - a modular multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, processing 4.17B GPT-4o tokens.

Result: Models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over strong vision-language baselines using semantic matching metrics (SemAP and SemF1).

Conclusion: AnomReason and AnomAgent provide a foundation for measuring and improving semantic plausibility of AI-generated images, with practical applications in explainable deepfake detection and semantic reasonableness assessment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

*Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Ming Li,Yuheng Li,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large vision models (LVM) demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities in medical imaging tasks including organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction without domain-specific training, achieving state-of-the-art performance in radiotherapy motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on medical data, leveraging the zero-shot generalization capabilities of large generative models.

Method: Evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in zero-shot setting across four medical imaging tasks: organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction using 4D CT data from 122 patients (over 1,820 3D CT volumes).

Result: The LVM achieves competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution, and surpasses specialized baselines in motion prediction with state-of-the-art spatial accuracy, producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific respiratory dynamics.

Conclusion: Large vision models exhibit emergent zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling, highlighting their potential as unified learners and reasoners for future medical foundation models built on video models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting efficiency in few-shot scenarios by replacing positional gradient with opacity gradient for densification and using conservative pruning, achieving 40-70% fewer primitives with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with overfitting and bloated reconstructions in few-shot scenarios, and existing methods like FSGS improve quality but significantly increase primitive count.

Method: Replaces standard positional gradient heuristic with opacity gradient as densification trigger, pairs aggressive densification with conservative pruning schedule, and uses depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance.

Result: Achieves 40% more compact than FSGS on 3-view LLFF (32k vs 57k primitives) and ~70% reduction on Mip-NeRF 360 dataset with modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: Establishes new state-of-the-art on quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis with dramatic compactness gains.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio- and pose-driven human animation methods struggle with stiff head movements and blurry hands due to weak correlation between audio and head movements, and the structural complexity of hands.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Pre-trained Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) for high-fidelity hand texture priors, 2) Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) for separate modeling of lip sync and head pose dynamics with interaction, 3) Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) for refining pose conditions with relaxed constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance with superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: VividAnimator effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by producing high-quality animations with natural head movements and clear hand details through its innovative framework components.

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Motivation: Current approaches rely exclusively on either perspective-view or bird's-eye-view features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera features, introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models using DINOv2 features, and integrates PV features with BEV maps via deformable aggregation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks, demonstrating improved 3D object detection and tracking capabilities.

Conclusion: Foundation model BEV maps enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving by effectively combining complementary PV and BEV representations.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained

a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

*Joy Hsu,Emily Jin,Jiajun Wu,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FactoredScenes is a framework that generates realistic 3D scenes by decomposing rooms into hierarchical concepts using learned layout patterns and program-conditioned object pose prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenes are difficult to capture with limited data available, and generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open challenge.

Method: Uses factored representation to decompose scenes into room programs and object poses, learns layout patterns from real scenes, employs large language models for program generation, and uses program-conditioned hierarchical pose prediction.

Result: Generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

Conclusion: FactoredScenes successfully synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging room structure and learning object pose variations from lived-in scenes.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an

demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

*Rugved Katole,Christopher Stewart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ortho-Fuse enables reliable orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery with 20% reduced overlap requirements using optical flow-based transitional image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven crop health mapping faces adoption barriers due to technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse datasets, as traditional methods require 70-80% image overlap which is hard to achieve in resource-constrained conditions.

Method: Uses optical flow-based framework with intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction.

Result: Experimental validation shows 20% reduction in minimum overlap requirements for reliable orthomosaic generation.

Conclusion: The approach addresses key technical barriers and identifies pathways for enhanced integration of AI-driven monitoring systems in precision agriculture.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

### [227] [PointMAC: Meta-Learned Adaptation for Robust Test-Time Point Cloud Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10365)
*Linlian Jiang,Rui Ma,Li Gu,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointMAC is a meta-learned framework for test-time adaptation in point cloud completion that enables sample-specific refinement without additional supervision through self-supervised auxiliary objectives and meta-auxiliary learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time.

Method: The method uses meta-auxiliary learning with two self-supervised auxiliary objectives simulating structural and sensor-level incompleteness, optimized via Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). During inference, only the shared encoder is adapted using auxiliary losses while the decoder remains fixed. Adaptive λ-Calibration balances gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions.

Conclusion: PointMAC is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion, enabling robust adaptation to novel patterns and distortions without requiring additional supervision.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

*Saurabh Kataria,Ayca Ermis,Lovely Yeswanth Panchumarthi,Minxiao Wang,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance on PPG signal analysis by converting 1D signals to 2D image representations like STFT, outperforming specialized time-series models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Vision Foundation Models can be effectively applied to PPG signal analysis, potentially providing better performance than specialized time-series models while being computationally efficient.

Method: Transform 1D PPG signals into 2D image representations (STFT, phase plots, recurrence plots) and fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (DINOv3, SIGLIP-2) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on blood pressure estimation and promising results on other vital signs and blood lab measurements, with good generalization across different 2D input representations.

Conclusion: Vision Foundation Models provide a powerful new approach for PPG analysis that outperforms specialized time-series models while being computationally efficient through PEFT techniques.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

TL;DR: Crack-Segmenter is a fully self-supervised framework for pavement crack detection that eliminates the need for manual annotations, outperforming supervised methods across multiple datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of costly and time-intensive pixel-level annotations in pavement crack detection, enabling scalable and cost-effective infrastructure monitoring.

Method: Developed Crack-Segmenter with three modules: Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for multi-scale feature extraction, Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining crack continuity, and Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) for adaptive feature integration.

Result: Outperformed 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods on ten public datasets across all major metrics including mIoU, Dice score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance.

Conclusion: Annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but superior to supervised approaches, enabling scalable infrastructure monitoring and advancing self-supervised learning in pavement crack detection.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

### [230] [Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383)
*Sai Teja Erukude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the "black box" problem in CNNs by proposing methods to identify hidden biases and distinguish between contextual information and background noise in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand their decision-making process and detect biases from background information, which can lead to unreliable results.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: 1) dividing images into smaller non-overlapping tiles and shuffling them randomly, and 2) applying image transforms (Fourier, Wavelet, Median filter) to recover background noise information used by CNNs.

Result: The methods effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and can detect background noise presence even without using background information, as tested on six different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques successfully address CNN's black box problem by identifying hidden biases and separating contextual learning from background noise, enhancing transparency in CNN-based image classification.

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Motivation: To create semantically rich video descriptions with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, benefiting both video understanding and generation tasks.

Method: Two-stage post-training pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT - fine-tuning on 107K high-quality temporally-aligned audiovisual captions, (2) AVoCaDO GRPO - using tailored reward functions to enhance temporal coherence, dialogue accuracy, and regulate caption length.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video captioning benchmarks, and achieves competitive performance on VDC and DREAM-1K benchmarks under visual-only settings.

Conclusion: AVoCaDO demonstrates the effectiveness of temporal orchestration between audio and visual modalities for superior audiovisual video captioning performance.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions
with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting
both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a
powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration
between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training
pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated
dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2)
AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance
temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and
reducing collapse. Experimental results demonstrate that AVoCaDO significantly
outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video
captioning benchmarks, and also achieves competitive performance on the VDC and
DREAM-1K benchmark under visual-only settings.

### [232] [Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10406)
*Zhao-Yang Wang,Jieneng Chen,Jiang Liu,Yuxiang Guo,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait is a novel multi-modal gait recognition framework that reconstructs 3D heatmaps from 2D silhouettes to combine the strengths of both 2D and 3D representations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gait recognition methods using 2D representations struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise, while multi-modal approaches with 3D body shape information are computationally expensive and not suitable for real-time applications.

Method: Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation from 2D silhouettes, enabling effective capture of 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity. It uses supervised learning with loss calculated between reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and meshes against ground truth for precise spatial alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in gait recognition while avoiding the heavy computational overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait provides an effective solution that combines the benefits of 2D and 3D gait representations, enabling robust gait recognition with computational efficiency suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

### [233] [Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414)
*Chin-Hung Teng,Ben-Jian Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feature matching method that integrates feature spatial order with epipolar geometry in a progressive framework to improve efficiency and accuracy, particularly for images with many features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature matching is time-consuming for images with large numbers of features. Feature spatial order provides an independent concept from epipolar geometry that can complement it to improve matching efficiency.

Method: Integrate feature spatial order into progressive matching framework, using initial matches to build spatial order model and calculate possible spatial ranges for subsequent matches. Combine with epipolar geometry and propose image alignment method using fundamental matrix to handle image rotation effects.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets, simulated images, and real images show the method is significantly more efficient and accurate than traditional feature matching approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of feature spatial order with epipolar geometry in a progressive matching framework effectively improves both efficiency and accuracy of feature matching.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal multi-task framework combining 2D silhouettes and 3D SMPL features for gait recognition and human attribute estimation using a unified transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single modality approaches fail to capture full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns, especially in challenging conditions like long distances and extreme angles.

Method: Multi-modal framework combining 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features, using unified transformer for feature fusion and multi-task learning for gait recognition and attribute estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on BRIAR datasets under challenging conditions (1km distance, 50° pitch angles) and provides accurate human attribute estimation.

Conclusion: Multi-modal and multi-task learning shows promise for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a video-based deep learning approach using transfer learning with InceptionV3 and LSTM networks to predict cybersickness severity in VR environments, achieving 68.4% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersickness remains a major barrier to widespread VR adoption, and while multimodal approaches exist, there's limited research on using video-based features for cybersickness prediction.

Method: Transfer learning with InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet to extract visual features from VR gameplay videos, followed by LSTM network to capture temporal dynamics and predict cybersickness severity over time.

Result: Achieved 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity, surpassing existing video-only models.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate cybersickness, and establishes foundation for future video-based temporal modeling research to enhance user comfort in VR applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

### [236] [Taming a Retrieval Framework to Read Images in Humanlike Manner for Augmenting Generation of MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10426)
*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG is a framework that improves multimodal reasoning by staging it as a "what-where-reweight" cascade, using open-vocabulary detection, spatial resolution with SAM masks, and adaptive prioritization to reduce hallucinations in fine-grained visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often fail in fine-grained visual question answering due to hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations, as textual queries are not explicitly anchored to visual referents. Current RAG methods lack local detail and fine-grained interaction reasoning.

Method: The framework uses a three-stage cascade: 1) "what" - anchor queries to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection, 2) "where" - spatially resolve with SAM-derived masks for fine-grained precision, 3) "reweight" - adaptively prioritize through local-global alignment trade-off. Mask-guided fine-tuning injects spatial evidence into generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward trustworthy reasoning.

Conclusion: The human-like cascade approach significantly improves multimodal reasoning by transforming grounding from passive bias to explicit constraint, making MLLMs more reliable for fine-grained visual question answering.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve markerless, image-based robot pose estimation by addressing limitations of current methods that use fixed-scale perturbations, which lack diversity and may generate out-of-view poses.

Method: Two-stage diffusion framework: (1) visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse in-view pose augmentation, (2) timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement using diffusion posterior sampling.

Result: Achieved 66.75 AUC on the most challenging DREAM dataset, representing 32.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods across two benchmarks (DREAM and RoboKeyGen).

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based approach with visibility constraints and timestep-aware refinement significantly improves robot pose estimation accuracy and robustness compared to direct prediction methods.

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

*Tai Le-Gia,Ahn Jaehyun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDeGraph is a zero-shot anomaly detection method that identifies and filters consistent anomalies using graph-based community detection and neighbor-burnout phenomenon analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation-based methods struggle with consistent anomalies - similar defects recurring across multiple images - leading to poor performance in zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation.

Method: Constructs an image-level graph with images as nodes, connects those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, uses community detection to filter anomalies. Leverages neighbor-burnout phenomenon where consistent-anomaly patches show abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting limited similar matches.

Result: Achieves 98.3% AUROC for AC and 66.8% F1 (+4.2%) and 68.1% AP (+5.4%) for AS on MVTec AD with ViT-L-14-336. With DINOv2 backbone: 69.1% F1 (+6.5%) and 71.9% AP (+9.2%).

Conclusion: CoDeGraph effectively addresses consistent anomaly detection in zero-shot settings, demonstrating robustness across different backbone architectures and significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

TL;DR: A new framework for medical image segmentation that treats expert disagreements as valuable clinical uncertainty rather than noise, using group decision simulation to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches that average expert labels discard valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in inter-rater variability, which arises from differences in annotator expertise and image blurriness.

Method: Group decision simulation framework with Expert Signature Generator (ESG) to learn individual annotator styles in latent space, and Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) to intelligently generate final segmentation by sampling from this space.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets with 92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores respectively.

Conclusion: Treating expert disagreement as useful signal instead of noise provides a clear path toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTIPS is a novel multimodal framework for TIPS prognosis prediction that addresses challenges in ROI annotation, unimodal limitations, and single-endpoint assessment through dual-option segmentation, multimodal interaction, and multi-task prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIPS prognostic models face challenges with labor-intensive ROI annotation, poor reliability of unimodal methods, incomplete single-endpoint assessment, and lack of public datasets, necessitating a more robust and comprehensive solution.

Method: Three core modules: (1) dual-option segmentation using semi-supervised and foundation model-based pipelines, (2) multimodal interaction with MGRA, POD, and CGPE techniques for cross-modal feature integration, and (3) multi-task prediction with staged training for survival, PPG, and OHE prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on MultiTIPS dataset demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, with strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability, showing promise for clinical application.

Conclusion: The proposed MultiTIPS framework effectively addresses key challenges in TIPS prognosis prediction and provides a comprehensive solution with public dataset availability, advancing research in this field.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

*Jinjin Cao,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Weijian Luo,Guojun Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMG is a training-free decoding method that reduces hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by leveraging the difference between original and degraded visual-language attention distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs face severe hallucination problems where they generate fluent but image-irrelevant responses due to language bias.

Method: Adaptively mask attention weights of influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt visual-language perception, then use the difference between original and degraded distributions for decoding.

Result: CMG significantly reduces language bias without harming VLM capabilities, improves performance on hallucination benchmarks, and generalizes effectively across different VLMs.

Conclusion: CMG provides superior advantages for reducing hallucinations with no additional conditions or training costs, effectively addressing the language bias problem in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

*Chuang Chen,Wenyi Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAGLFNet is a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework for LiDAR point clouds that uses global-local feature fusion, multi-branch feature extraction, and deep feature-guided attention to improve feature discriminability and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-image-based methods for LiDAR point cloud processing often overlook structural and semantic details, leading to limited feature fusion and discriminability, which motivates the development of a more effective feature extraction framework.

Method: Three main components: 1) Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding module for local feature correlation and global context capture, 2) Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network for neighborhood information and contour feature enhancement, 3) Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism for cross-channel feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 69.83% on SemanticKITTI validation set and 78.65% on nuScenes validation set, demonstrating high performance while maintaining real-time capability.

Conclusion: DAGLFNet effectively balances performance and efficiency for LiDAR-based real-time applications through its discriminative feature extraction approach.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

*Deng Li,Jun Shao,Bohao Xing,Rong Gao,Bihan Wen,Heikki Kälviäinen,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba+ models that enhance vanilla Mamba with motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling for micro-gesture recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, Transformers have high computational costs, and vanilla Mamba lacks local spatiotemporal modeling and motion-awareness capabilities needed for micro-gesture recognition.

Method: Introduced motion-aware state fusion Mamba (MSF-Mamba) that fuses local contextual neighboring states using central frame difference (CFD) for motion awareness. MSF-Mamba+ adds multiscale motion-aware state fusion with adaptive scale weighting to dynamically weigh fused states across different scales.

Result: Experiments on two public MGR datasets show that even the lightweight MSF-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed MSF-Mamba models effectively address the limitations of vanilla Mamba by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing them to capture subtle motion cues for micro-gesture recognition with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models can self-refine using a Triangular Consistency framework to generate their own training data without external supervision, achieving autonomous improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction and validate their inherent self-refinement capabilities for autonomous learning.

Method: Proposed a self-refinement framework based on Triangular Consistency principle: (1) multi-task instruction tuning, (2) generating image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images with consistency filtering, (3) model updates using synthetic data.

Result: Using LLaVA-1.5 baseline, the model achieved consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks without any external supervision like human annotations or environmental feedback.

Conclusion: VLMs possess inherent self-refinement capabilities that enable autonomous learning, providing insights for future research on VLM learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

TL;DR: HARoPE is a head-wise adaptive extension of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that addresses limitations in image generation by enabling dynamic frequency reallocation and semantic alignment through a learnable linear transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-dimensional RoPE has limitations in fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting for image generation due to rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment.

Method: Proposes HARoPE which inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via SVD before the rotary mapping, enabling dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields while preserving RoPE's relative-position property.

Result: Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) show HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions.

Conclusion: HARoPE serves as an effective drop-in replacement offering a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D is a fast 3D style transfer method that uses jigsaw operations on reference images to isolate style from content, then applies it via multi-view diffusion for consistent 3D asset stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods either inject style tokens directly or use slow score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which often entangle style with semantic content and require heavy per-scene optimization.

Method: Uses jigsaw operations (spatial shuffling and random masking) on reference patches to suppress object semantics and isolate style statistics. Integrates style cues into multi-view diffusion via cross-attention to produce consistent stylized renderings, then bakes them onto 3D surfaces.

Result: Achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency compared to existing methods. Generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation.

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D provides an efficient approach to 3D style transfer that effectively decouples style from content while maintaining view consistency and enabling fast stylization of 3D assets.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: VR-Thinker is a thinking-with-image framework that improves multimodal reward models by enabling active visual reasoning operations and configurable visual memory windows, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video preference benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reward models face limitations with large visual context budgets causing loss of fine-grained details and packing all visual information into initial prompts leading to hallucination and forgetting during reasoning.

Method: Introduces VR-Thinker with visual reasoning operations and configurable visual memory windows, using a three-stage reinforcement fine-tuning pipeline: Cold Start with visual chain-of-thought data, Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning on high-quality traces, and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video preference benchmarks: 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video with a 7B model, especially effective for longer videos.

Conclusion: The approach validates the effectiveness and promise of thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling for improving reasoning fidelity and reliability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

TL;DR: Proposes methods to expand CNN receptive field with fixed table size for LUT-based inference, using lattice vector quantization and other strategies to improve performance while maintaining space efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LUT methods for CNN inference suffer from limited receptive field due to combinatorial explosion of table size, restricting their effectiveness in capturing broader contextual information.

Method: Uses optimal lattice vector quantizer for adaptive resolution allocation, irregular dilated convolutions, and U-shaped cascaded LUT structure to expand receptive field without increasing table size.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over existing LUT methods by effectively balancing speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency while expanding receptive field.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances LUT-driven CNN inference performance by expanding receptive field with fixed table size through adaptive quantization and multi-level contextual capture strategies.

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

### [251] [MCE: Towards a General Framework for Handling Missing Modalities under Imbalanced Missing Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10534)
*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to address imbalanced missing modalities in multi-modal learning through two components: Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE) for dynamic modality balancing and Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE) for improved feature quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle imbalanced missing rates across modalities, which creates a vicious cycle where modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to degraded representations and inconsistent learning progress.

Method: MCE consists of two components: 1) LCE uses multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and 2) RCE improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing modality configurations.

Conclusion: MCE effectively addresses the challenges of imbalanced missing modalities by enhancing both learning capability and representation capability, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLOFNet is a multimodal dataset for monitoring and predicting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), integrating Sentinel-2 imagery, glacier velocity data, and land surface temperature records from the Shisper Glacier region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive GLOF research is hindered by fragmented and unimodal data, with most prior work focusing on post-event mapping rather than forecasting. There's a need for harmonized datasets combining visual indicators with physical precursors.

Method: Integration of three data sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and MODIS Land Surface Temperature records. Preprocessing included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding.

Result: The dataset reveals seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions. GLOFNet is publicly available and addresses challenges like class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution.

Conclusion: GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep learning approaches to rare hazard prediction, supporting future research in glacial hazard forecasting.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRS-YOLO improves YOLO11 for railway transmission line foreign object detection with better accuracy and efficiency through multi-scale feature fusion, enhanced neck structure, optimized detection head, and channel pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address missed detection, false detection, and low detection efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway environment.

Method: Proposed MAKDF module with C3k2 for multi-scale feature extraction, RCFPN neck structure for feature integration, SC_Detect head for spatial/channel preprocessing, and channel pruning for model compression.

Result: mAP50: 94.8% (+0.7%), mAP50:95: 86.4% (+2.3%), Parameters reduced by 44.2%, GFLOPs reduced by 17.5%.

Conclusion: The improved algorithm can be better applied to foreign object detection in railroad transmission lines with higher accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters
and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated
that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

*Farouq Benchallal,Adel Hafiane,Nicolas Ragot,Raphael Canals*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a deep semi-supervised approach combining consistency regularization with similarity learning for weed species classification, addressing limited labeled data challenges in agricultural applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weed classification is crucial for precision agriculture but challenging due to similarities with crops and field condition variations. Deep learning requires large annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and laborious to create, limiting agricultural applications.

Method: Developed a deep semi-supervised approach that combines consistency regularization with similarity learning using a deep auto-encoder architecture to better utilize unlabeled data when labeled data is scarce.

Result: Experiments on DeepWeeds dataset and noisy conditions demonstrated the method's effectiveness and robustness compared to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning models. Ablation studies provided extended analysis of the joint learning strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised approach effectively addresses the labeled data scarcity problem in weed classification, providing robust performance comparable to fully supervised methods while requiring less labeled data.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

### [255] [UniFlow: A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer for Visual Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10575)
*Zhengrong Yue,Haiyu Zhang,Xiangyu Zeng,Boyu Chen,Chenting Wang,Shaobin Zhuang,Lu Dong,KunPeng Du,Yi Wang,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFlow is a unified tokenizer that overcomes the performance trade-off between visual understanding and generation through layer-wise adaptive self-distillation and a patch-wise pixel flow decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers face significant performance trade-offs between understanding and generation due to conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. The goal is to develop a universal tokenizer that achieves both tasks effectively.

Method: Proposes UniFlow with layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to pretrained visual encoders, and a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder that models conditional flow from noisy state to pixel domain using semantic features as conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments across 13 benchmarks and 7 visual tasks show UniFlow achieves win-win outcomes. The 7B UniFlow-XL surpasses 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on understanding benchmarks and achieves competitive generation results, outperforming UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID.

Conclusion: UniFlow successfully addresses the understanding-generation trade-off in visual tokenizers through adaptive self-distillation and efficient patch-wise reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance across multiple visual tasks.

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

### [256] [Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577)
*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-ABFlow is a novel optical flow estimation framework that uses diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion to address challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical flow estimation struggles in high-speed and low-light scenes due to motion blur and insufficient illumination, which weaken texture and amplify noise. Frame cameras provide dense appearance saturation but sparse boundary completeness, while event cameras offer the opposite. Traditional methods using feature fusion or domain adaptation still suffer from deteriorated appearance features.

Method: Proposes Diff-ABFlow framework based on diffusion models that learn mapping from noisy flow to clear flow, unaffected by deteriorated visual features. Uses frame-event appearance-boundary fusion to combine the strengths of both camera types.

Result: The diffusion model approach avoids reliance on deteriorated visual features that affect both discriminative and generative models, potentially improving optical flow estimation in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide a promising alternative for optical flow estimation in degraded scenes by learning flow-to-flow mappings rather than relying on deteriorated visual features, with frame-event fusion addressing complementary limitations of both camera types.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

### [257] [Equipping Vision Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10584)
*Shizhen Zhao,Jiahui Liu,Xin Wen,Haoru Tan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pre-trained vision foundation models like DINOv2 naturally provide discriminative features for OOD detection without fine-tuning. However, performance drops with large semantic spaces. The paper proposes Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) and Dynamic-β Mixup to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate vision foundation models for OOD detection and address their limitations in large semantic spaces where decision boundaries become complex.

Method: 1) Uses pre-trained DINOv2 as baseline; 2) Proposes Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) to partition features into subspaces; 3) Introduces Dynamic-β Mixup strategy with adaptive interpolation weights from beta distribution.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in extensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to existing methods without complex designs.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models show strong potential for OOD detection, and the proposed MoFE with Dynamic-β Mixup effectively handles complex decision boundaries in large semantic spaces.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

### [258] [A Simple and Better Baseline for Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10587)
*Jingchao Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Dingjiang Huang,Hong Wang,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSVG is a simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding that directly integrates linguistic and visual modalities without iterative procedures, using language-guided feature selection to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual grounding methods use iterative procedures across image scales and require caching linguistic/visual features, creating extra computational overhead. The goal is to simplify implementation while maintaining performance.

Method: FSVG encapsulates both modalities in a single network without iterations, uses language as parallel guidance for modality interaction, and employs similarity-based feature selection to only use language-relevant visual features for faster prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show FSVG achieves better balance between accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FSVG provides an effective baseline that simplifies visual grounding implementation while maintaining competitive performance through direct modality integration and language-guided feature selection.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf is a unified post-training paradigm that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to overcome their individual limitations in training Large Vision-and-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT often leads to sub-optimal performance while RLVR struggles with tasks beyond the model's internal knowledge base. There's a need to integrate both approaches to leverage their complementary strengths.

Method: ViSurf integrates SFT and RLVR in a single stage by injecting ground-truth labels into RLVR rollouts, providing simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. It also introduces three novel reward control strategies to stabilize training.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show ViSurf outperforms individual SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT→RLVR approaches.

Conclusion: ViSurf provides an effective unified framework that successfully combines the strengths of both SFT and RLVR, validated through comprehensive analysis and experiments.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single task, lacking a unified framework for multi-task quality assessment.

Method: Construct reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset via rejection sampling, apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Gaussian-based reward, and incorporate STD filtering and entropy gating for training stability.

Result: The framework enables continuous score prediction and interpretable reward signals for multi-dimensional quality reasoning.

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R provides a structured approach to unified visual quality assessment across multiple tasks with improved training stability and generalization.

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework that enhances linear attention in Graph Transformers by increasing attention rank through gated local graph networks and sharpening focus using learnable log-power functions, achieving competitive performance while maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention mechanisms in Graph Transformers suffer from reduced expressiveness due to low-rank projections and uniform attention distributions, which limit class separability and classification ability.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework with: 1) gated local graph network branch attached to value matrix to increase attention rank, and 2) learnable log-power function in attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus.

Result: Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks show competitive performance while preserving linear attention's scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively addresses expressiveness limitations of linear attention while maintaining computational efficiency, enhancing both rank and focus of attention distributions.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based talking-head generation methods struggle with temporal coherence and fine-grained motion control, needing better solutions for synchronized, controllable video synthesis.

Method: Uses a motion auto-encoder to create a disentangled latent space for motion factors, then applies optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across multiple benchmarks in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity.

Conclusion: Combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling offers a powerful new paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

*Sebastian Schmidt,Julius Körner,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for corner case recognition in autonomous driving that considers data distribution rather than individual examples, achieving strong performance on detection tasks and unifying existing taxonomies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional corner case categorization based on individual examples is not scalable and lacks data coverage perspective, failing to generalize to ML model training data in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Proposed framework for corner case recognition that takes underlying data distribution into account, enabling analysis of individual samples and combined corner cases through a fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset.

Result: The approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection across standard benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases.

Conclusion: The method provides a principled basis for corner case recognition with manual specification-free definition, offering a scalable and data-coverage-aware alternative to traditional example-based approaches.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,

### [264] [Stability Under Scrutiny: Benchmarking Representation Paradigms for Online HD Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10660)
*Hao Shan,Ruikai Li,Han Jiang,Yizhe Fan,Ziyang Yan,Bohan Li,Xiaoshuai Hao,Hao Zhao,Zhiyong Cui,Yilong Ren,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal stability in online HD mapping models for autonomous driving, proposing novel stability metrics and showing that accuracy and stability are largely independent performance dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online HD mapping models focus on per-frame accuracy but ignore temporal stability, which is crucial for autonomous driving systems operating in dynamic environments where sensor displacement causes mapping shifts that affect downstream tasks.

Method: Proposed a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Conducted extensive experiments on 42 models and variants.

Result: Accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. Analysis identified architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both.

Conclusion: Temporal stability should be treated as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy in online HD mapping. The work advances development of more reliable autonomous driving systems and includes a public benchmark release.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at

*Gaojian Wang,Feng Lin,Tong Wu,Zhisheng Yan,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-VFM is a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns robust facial representations by combining masked image modeling and instance discrimination with three learning objectives (3C), achieving state-of-the-art performance on various face security tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn robust and transferable facial representations from abundant unlabeled real faces that can generalize across various face security tasks, addressing the need for fundamental face representations without task-specific supervision.

Method: Proposes FS-VFM framework with three learning objectives (3C): intra-region Consistency, inter-region Coherency via CRFR-P masking strategy, and local-to-global Correspondence via self-distillation coupling MIM with ID. Also introduces FS-Adapter for efficient transfer learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks show FS-VFM consistently outperforms diverse vision foundation models across natural and facial domains, various supervision paradigms, and ViT scales. Even beats state-of-the-art task-specific methods while FS-Adapter provides excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

Conclusion: FS-VFM successfully learns fundamental facial representations through self-supervised pre-training and demonstrates superior generalization across multiple face security tasks, establishing a scalable framework for face security foundation models.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting pre-trained Text-to-Video (T2V) models for viewpoint prediction from 4D scenes using a two-stage approach that injects 4D scene representation and performs camera extrinsic denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the video generation prior of T2V models for viewpoint planning, since videos naturally contain dynamic scenes with viewpoints, making them suitable as implicit world models for 4D interaction.

Method: Two-stage paradigm: 1) Inject 4D scene representation into T2V model via adaptive learning branch, 2) Formulate viewpoint extraction as hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process using a camera extrinsic diffusion branch.

Result: Experimental results show superiority over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of key technical designs.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of video generation models for 4D interaction in the real world.

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of image-to-video transfer learning, where image-language foundation models are extended to video domain to reduce data and computational requirements for video-text learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the substantial data and computational requirements of training video-language foundation models from scratch by leveraging existing image-language foundation models through transfer learning to the video domain.

Method: Systematically classifies image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features (preserving original representations) and modified features (undergoing modifications), and analyzes their applications across various video-text learning tasks.

Result: Presents detailed experimental analysis investigating the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on downstream video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Establishes a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing image-language foundation models and identifies challenges and promising future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

*Yuxiang Luo,Qing Xu,Hai Huang,Yuqi Ouyang,Zhen Chen,Wenting Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSM-Seg is a novel framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation that introduces a dual-memory paradigm with category-agnostic prompts, addressing limitations of existing prompt-based methods by leveraging cross-modal correlations and inter-slice information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based segmentation methods ignore cross-modal correlations and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their real-world applicability in clinical brain tumor diagnosis.

Method: Proposes MSM-Seg with three key components: modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) for cross-modal and inter-slice relationships, multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) for tumor guidance, and modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) for complementary information fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that MSM-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: The MSM-Seg framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by synergistically integrating multi-modal information with efficient category-agnostic prompts, providing improved performance for clinical brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSM framework unifies action detection and anticipation by compressing video frames into critical states, modeling action dynamics with state-transition graphs, and using cross-temporal interactions to refine features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in untrimmed videos and the overlooked influence of agent intention on action understanding.

Method: Critical State-Based Memory Compression reduces redundancy; Action Pattern Learning builds state-transition graphs for action dynamics; Cross-Temporal Interaction models intention influence.

Result: Superior performance on EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and PDMB datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates importance of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions for future action understanding research.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

*Xuankai Zhang,Junjin Xiao,Qing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos using blur prediction networks and dynamic Gaussian densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are specialized for either defocus blur or motion blur, lacking a unified approach. Joint modeling as blur kernel convolution is challenging due to difficulty in estimating accurate blur kernels.

Method: Proposes per-pixel blur kernel estimation using a blur prediction network with blur-aware sparsity constraint, dynamic Gaussian densification for incomplete regions, and novel view synthesis optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully handles both defocus and motion blur in dynamic Gaussian Splatting, achieving superior performance in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR/AR systems need intelligent adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction, requiring accurate understanding of human intentions and prediction of future behaviors like gaze direction and object interactions.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical framework that identifies interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained behaviors using dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to capture human-environment relationships from historical dynamics and scene contexts.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks and live VR environments demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, enabling practical applications for proactive VR systems.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models cognitive processes to predict human behaviors, allowing VR systems to anticipate user actions and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of underwater video footage is impractical due to vast volume of uneventful content, requiring automated methods to identify anomalous events for marine biodiversity assessment.

Method: Introduced AURA benchmark dataset with multi-annotator labels, evaluated four VAD models across two marine scenes, and employed robust frame selection strategies to extract meaningful video segments.

Result: VAD performance varies dramatically across models and is highly sensitive to training data amount and visual content variability defining 'normal' scenes. Soft and consensus labels proved valuable.

Conclusion: The approach offers practical support for scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring through automated anomaly detection in underwater video footage.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inherently interpretable face similarity metric that decomposes global similarity into patch-level contributions, eliminating the need for post-hoc explanation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-hoc interpretability methods for deep neural networks have uncertain fidelity due to lack of reliable evaluation metrics, motivating the design of inherently interpretable models.

Method: A face similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from restricted receptive fields, defining similarity as the sum of patch-level similarity scores.

Result: Achieves competitive verification performance with 28x28 patches in 112x112 images, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods with 56x56 patches.

Conclusion: The proposed locally additive explanation approach provides inherently interpretable face similarity analysis without relying on post-hoc methods.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of multi-label CT classification due to complex spatial relationships in volumetric data and variability of abnormalities, overcoming limitations of 3D CNNs (struggle with long-range dependencies) and Vision Transformers (require extensive pre-training).

Method: Represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs where axial slice triplets serve as nodes, processed through spectral graph convolution to capture inter-slice dependencies while maintaining clinical deployment compatibility.

Result: Achieves strong cross-dataset generalization across 3 independent institution datasets, shows competitive performance vs state-of-the-art visual encoders, and demonstrates broader applicability through transfer experiments on radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.

Conclusion: The graph-based 2.5D approach effectively handles multi-label CT classification with good generalization and clinical deployment feasibility, extending previous MICCAI 2025 workshop work.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC-GAN is a novel framework that integrates style-content disentanglement with cluster-specific training for photorealistic underwater image synthesis, addressing challenges like color attenuation and turbidity through style-specific domain modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater image synthesis faces challenges from optical phenomena like color attenuation and turbidity, which create distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies. Generative models often struggle to model the non-uniform conditions of diverse underwater environments.

Method: Uses K-means clustering to partition dataset into style-specific domains, employs separate encoders for style and content latent spaces, integrates these via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), and trains independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific characteristics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with SSIM of 0.9012, PSNR of 32.5118 dB, and FID of 13.3728.

Conclusion: The DISC-GAN framework successfully addresses underwater image synthesis challenges through style-content disentanglement and cluster-specific training, demonstrating superior performance in generating photorealistic underwater images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model

(FID) of 13.3728.

*Rolandos Alexandros Potamias,Stathis Galanakis,Jiankang Deng,Athanasios Papaioannou,Stefanos Zafeiriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: imHead is a novel implicit 3D morphable model that represents expressive 3D head avatars and enables localized facial feature editing using a compact identity space and region-specific latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D morphable models struggle with complex full-head shapes due to strict topology and linear nature limitations. Previous methods for localized editing required expensive latent sizes by dividing latent space into local components.

Method: Proposed imHead uses deep implicit functions with a single compact identity space and introduces intermediate region-specific latent representations to enable local edits. Trained on a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities.

Result: The model demonstrates expressive power to represent diverse identities and expressions, outperforming previous approaches. Provides interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation with localized editing capabilities.

Conclusion: imHead successfully addresses limitations of traditional 3DMMs by combining compact identity representation with localized editing through region-specific latents, enabling more flexible and expressive 3D head modeling.

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

*Aleksandra Melnikova,Petr Matula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes, providing comprehensive dataset description and validation experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality segmentation annotations of volumetric images are critical for image processing but are time-consuming and challenging to create, especially for dynamic cell migration studies.

Method: Three distinct human annotators created 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations for two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells from the Cell Tracking Challenge, with validation against CTC tracking markers and 2D gold truth.

Result: The annotations are consistent with CTC tracking markers, segmentation accuracy is within inter-annotator variability margins, and they better represent image complexity compared to automatically created silver truth from CTC.

Conclusion: The presented 3D annotations are valuable for testing and training cell segmentation algorithms and analyzing 3D shapes of highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds in optical satellite imagery obstruct reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research, requiring effective cloud segmentation methods.

Method: Uses Swin Transformer backbone with ASPP and PSP multi-scale context modules, Cross-Attention block for multisensor fusion, and Efficient Channel Attention Block with Spatial Attention Module for feature refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome datasets while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.

Conclusion: MSCloudCAM is effective and practical for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining CNN with XGBoost improves fairness in chest X-ray diagnosis across demographic groups while maintaining performance, with active learning providing the best bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when performance varies across demographic groups like sex, age, and race.

Method: Extended CNN-XGBoost pipeline for multi-label classification, replacing CNN final layer with XGBoost classifier. Tested with DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50 backbones. Compared with adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active learning.

Result: XGBoost replacement improves fairness while maintaining or improving overall predictive performance. Combined with active learning yields largest bias reduction across all demographic subgroups on CheXpert and MIMIC datasets.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology with competitive bias reduction at lower computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two merging strategies (ECLM and Mask-ToMe) and a diffusion-based decoder to optimize 3D Human Mesh Recovery transformers, achieving 2.3x speed-up with slightly improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent transformer-based 3D HMR models suffer from high computational cost and complexity due to deep architectures and redundant tokens.

Method: Proposes Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) to merge transformer layers with minimal MPJPE impact, Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe) to merge background tokens, and a diffusion-based decoder with temporal context and pose priors.

Result: Achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while slightly improving performance over baseline across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed merging strategies and diffusion decoder effectively optimize transformer-based HMR models, reducing computational cost while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareBoost3D is a synthetic point cloud dataset that addresses the long-tail problem in LiDAR perception by providing more instances for rare classes, complemented by a cross-domain semantic alignment method (CSC loss) to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point cloud datasets suffer from long-tail distribution problems where rare classes have limited instances, hindering the development of robust LiDAR-based perception technologies for autonomous driving.

Method: Created RareBoost3D synthetic dataset with more instances for rare classes, and proposed CSC loss method for cross-domain semantic alignment to align feature representations of same classes across synthetic and real-world domains.

Result: Experimental results show that the cross-domain semantic alignment significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.

Conclusion: The combination of synthetic data augmentation for rare classes and cross-domain alignment effectively addresses the long-tail problem in LiDAR point cloud segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EarthWhere is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' image geolocation capabilities, testing visual recognition, reasoning, and evidence use across 810 globally distributed images at country and street levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have advanced rapidly but their capacity for image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions hasn't been comprehensively evaluated, despite being a challenging and practical real-world task.

Method: Created EarthWhere benchmark with 810 globally distributed images across two scales: WhereCountry (500 multiple-choice questions with country-level answers) and WhereStreet (310 fine-grained street-level tasks requiring multi-step reasoning). Proposed intermediate reasoning chain scoring using human-verified visual clues and Shapley-reweighted thinking scores.

Result: Benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art VLMs: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieved best average accuracy at 56.32%, while strongest open-weight model GLM-4.5V reached 34.71%. Web search and reasoning don't guarantee improved performance with limited visual clues, and models show regional biases (up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas).

Conclusion: The findings highlight both the promise and persistent challenges of models in mitigating bias and achieving robust, fine-grained localization. The benchmark is open-sourced to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

*Junwon You,Dasol Kang,Jae-Hun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToMCLIP introduces topological alignment to improve multilingual CLIP models by preserving global geometry in embedding spaces, enhancing zero-shot accuracy and multilingual retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual VLMs have biased cross-modal alignment toward English and neglect global geometry of shared embedding spaces, limiting their effectiveness across languages.

Method: Proposes topological alignment framework using persistent homology to define alignment loss, with graph sparsification for efficient persistence diagram approximation with theoretical error bounds.

Result: Shows enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on xFlickr&CO.

Conclusion: ToMCLIP provides an effective method for topological alignment in representation learning that improves multilingual VLMs and has broader applications beyond vision-language models.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

TL;DR: SceneTextStylizer is a training-free diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text in scene images, enabling prompt-guided style transformation while preserving text readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text editing methods are limited to content replacement and simple styles, lacking free-style transfer capability for localized text regions.

Method: Uses diffusion model inversion with feature injection module, region control mechanism with distance-based changing mask, and style enhancement module based on Fourier transform.

Result: Superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and text preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables flexible and localized style editing for scene text while maintaining readability and stylistic consistency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model
based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial
structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various

Motivation: Current vision-language models like CLIP have limited fine-grained alignment capabilities, particularly for non-English languages, struggling with object attributes, spatial relations, and bilingual comprehension.

Method: Leverages fine-grained supervision including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, with multiple discriminative objectives and Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on large-scale English and Chinese data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 29 datasets across 8 tasks, with powerful bilingual performance. Also introduces a new Chinese multimodal understanding benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2 successfully addresses fine-grained bilingual alignment challenges and advances vision-language understanding for both English and Chinese.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level

*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a calibration-free uncertainty indicator for generative model-based inverse problems that detects distribution shift by measuring reconstruction stability under random measurement variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods for generative priors in inverse problems require calibration datasets, provide heuristic estimates, or don't specifically address distribution shift issues.

Method: Uses reconstruction stability under random measurement variations as a proxy for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) images - in-distribution images remain stable while OOD images show greater variability.

Result: Validated on MNIST digit reconstruction, showing OOD digits have higher reconstruction variability and error compared to in-distribution digits.

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight deployment strategy that enables aggressive measurement reduction for in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out of distribution.

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

TL;DR: IUT-Plug is a module that enhances vision language models by using Image Understanding Trees to reduce context drift in logic, object identity, and style during multimodal generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with preserving logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text generation, limiting their generalization in complex scenarios.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) dynamic IUT-Plug extraction module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures, (2) coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal consistency.

Result: IUT-Plug improves accuracy on established benchmarks and effectively alleviates three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal QA scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed IUT-Plug framework successfully mitigates context drift in VLMs through explicit structured reasoning, enhancing their performance in complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR is a framework that fine-tunes Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to improve robustness and explainability in chart reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization with verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs perform well on visual reasoning tasks but struggle with out-of-distribution data and produce unreliable chain-of-thought rationales, limiting explainability and trustworthiness.

Method: Fine-tunes LVLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with three automatically verifiable rewards: chart-type classification accuracy, faithful chart table reconstruction, and process conformity.

Result: Chart-RVR-3B models achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data while improving rationale fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that verifiable rewards with GRPO can train reliable and interpretable chart-reasoning models, closing the OOD performance gap and enhancing trust through better rationales.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

### [293] [Mixup Helps Understanding Multimodal Video Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10986)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Ding Ding,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multimodal Mixup (MM) and Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM) to address overfitting of strong modalities in multimodal video understanding, improving generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models often overfit to strong modalities, suppressing weaker ones, which limits their effectiveness in tasks like action recognition and emotion classification.

Method: MM applies Mixup at aggregated multimodal feature level to generate virtual feature-label pairs. B-MM extends this by dynamically adjusting mixing ratios for each modality based on their contributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show both methods effectively improve generalization and multimodal robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed MM and B-MM methods successfully mitigate modality overfitting and enhance multimodal learning performance.

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs), establishing a conceptual framework with three dimensions: internal intelligence, external tool invocation, and environment interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, with a shift from traditional static, passive AI agents to dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic AI systems.

Method: The authors establish a conceptual framework organizing agentic MLLMs along three dimensions: agentic internal intelligence (reasoning, reflection, memory), agentic external tool invocation (proactive tool use), and agentic environment interaction (action-taking in dynamic scenarios).

Result: The survey compiles open-source training frameworks, datasets for developing agentic MLLMs, reviews downstream applications, and outlines future research directions. A public repository is maintained for continuous tracking of developments.

Conclusion: Agentic MLLMs represent an emerging paradigm with significant potential for advancing AI capabilities toward AGI, requiring continued research in the three established dimensions and their applications.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

TL;DR: PAInpainter improves 3D Gaussian inpainting by using perspective-aware content propagation and multi-view consistency verification to enhance global consistency and texture fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring multi-view consistency remains a key challenge in 3D Gaussian inpainting despite progress with pretrained diffusion models.

Method: Iteratively refines inpainting and optimizes 3D Gaussian representation using perspective-aware content propagation and consistency verification across adaptively sampled multi-views from a perspective graph.

Result: Achieves superior 3D inpainting quality with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB on SPIn-NeRF and 29.51 dB on NeRFiller datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PAInpainter effectively enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in 3D scene restoration, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capability.

*Ruihang Xu,Dewei Zhou,Fan Ma,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ContextGen is a Diffusion Transformer framework for multi-instance image generation that uses layout and reference images to achieve precise object positioning and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with multi-instance generation due to limitations in precise layout control and maintaining identity consistency across multiple distinct subjects.

Method: Introduces Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) to incorporate layout images for object positioning, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA) to maintain identity fidelity using reference images. Also created IMIG-100K dataset with layout and identity annotations.

Result: ContextGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in multi-instance generation through layout anchoring and identity consistency mechanisms, setting new benchmarks for the task.

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

*Kai Han,Siqi Ma,Chengxuan Qian,Jun Chen,Chongwen Lyu,Yuqing Song,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FASS framework improves medical image segmentation by enhancing foreground focus, using frequency analysis for boundary details, and preserving geometric continuity, achieving superior performance on complex low-contrast images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models struggle with foreground focus in complex medical images where tumors resemble normal tissues, making contextual differentiation difficult in low-contrast backgrounds.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Foreground-aware module amplifies background-volume distinction, 2) Wavelet-based frequency enhancement extracts high-frequency features for boundaries, 3) Edge constraint module preserves geometric continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance across all metrics, with strong robustness under complex conditions and improved fine structure recognition in low-contrast medical images.

Conclusion: FASS framework significantly enhances segmentation of challenging medical images and enables applications in diverse, complex medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

*Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Tree improves VLMs' compositional reasoning using neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs, boosting performance by 5-10% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning involving multiple objects, attributes, and relations. Existing approaches are either resource-intensive or lack interpretable reasoning processes.

Method: Augments VLM outputs with neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs using beam search-inspired reasoning to provide interpretable rationales.

Result: Significantly improves compositional generalization by 5-10% across four benchmarks (Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, SugarCrepe) in seven different VLMs.

Conclusion: COCO-Tree effectively enhances VLM compositional reasoning while providing interpretable rationales, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

*Runyang Feng,Hyung Jin Chang,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Boeun Kim,Yi Chang,Yixing Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework that extends Mamba (state space models) to separately learn global and local spatiotemporal representations for video-based human pose estimation, addressing limitations of existing methods in balancing global and local modeling while maintaining linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VHPE methods struggle to balance global dynamic contexts and local motion details within single modeling structures, often biasing toward one aspect. They also suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting applicability for high-resolution sequences.

Method: Proposes Global Spatiotemporal Mamba with 6D selective space-time scan and spatial-temporal modulated scan merging for global representations, and Local Refinement Mamba with windowed space-time scan for enhancing local keypoint motion details.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends Mamba for VHPE by separately modeling global and local spatiotemporal representations, demonstrating superior performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeoVLMath, an LVLM that uses reinforcement learning with cross-modal rewards to generate textual descriptions of auxiliary lines for solving geometry problems, achieving competitive performance on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auxiliary lines are crucial for complex geometry problems but challenging for LVLMs. Current image editing models struggle with geometric precision when drawing auxiliary lines, so the paper focuses on generating textual descriptions that better align with LVLMs' strengths.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework with cross-modal reward that evaluates how well generated auxiliary-line descriptions match ground-truth diagrams. Uses GRPO-based RL for precise diagram-text alignment. Created AuxSolidMath dataset of 3,018 geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned text fields.

Result: GeoVLMath at 3B and 7B scales achieves competitive and often superior performance compared to strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach of generating textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions with reinforcement learning and cross-modal rewards effectively enhances LVLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, providing a viable alternative to direct diagram editing.

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: GIR-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified multimodal models across three perspectives: understanding-generation consistency, reasoning-centric text-to-image generation, and multi-step reasoning in editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation in unified multimodal models, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks.

Method: The benchmark evaluates models across three complementary perspectives: (1) understanding-generation consistency, (2) reasoning-centric text-to-image generation requiring logical constraints and implicit knowledge, and (3) multi-step reasoning in editing. Task-specific evaluation pipelines are designed for each subset.

Result: Extensive ablations show that while unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation capabilities.

Conclusion: GIR-Bench provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating unified multimodal models, revealing that despite their advanced capabilities, there remains a significant gap between understanding and generation that needs to be addressed.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Motivation: To address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning in embodied AI systems.

Method: Developed Vlaser - a foundational VLA model integrating high-level reasoning with low-level control, built upon the Vlaser-6M dataset. Systematically examined how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on embodied reasoning benchmarks (spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, QA, task planning) and SOTA results on WidowX benchmark with competitive performance on Google Robot benchmark.

Conclusion: Successfully bridged embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning, providing insights into mitigating domain shift between pre-training data and embodied policy learning data.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the

TL;DR: A two-stage framework combining CLIP and SAM for zero-shot anomaly segmentation in industrial settings, achieving SOTA results with 10.3% improvement on Visa dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models show strong generalization but need proper guidance for downstream tasks like anomaly segmentation. Current methods struggle with SAM's object segmentation bias and rough boundaries.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module uses CLIP and SAM to generate point prompts for anomaly focus, (2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module with hybrid prompts and lightweight decoder for precise segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation across multiple datasets. On Visa dataset: 10.3% improvement in F1-max and 7.7% in AP metrics over previous SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages CLIP's anomaly localization and SAM's boundary perception, overcoming SAM's object segmentation bias and achieving precise anomaly segmentation in industrial settings.

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

Motivation: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardized datasets for reproducible deep learning model development, creating a need for curated benchmarks to support AI-driven clinical decision making.

Method: Created LaryngealCT benchmark with 1,029 CT scans from TCIA, extracted uniform 1mm isotropic volumes using weakly supervised parameter search, and benchmarked 3D DL architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) on early vs. advanced and T4 vs. non-T4 classification tasks.

Conclusion: LaryngealCT provides a reproducible foundation for AI-driven research in laryngeal oncology through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated explainability tools to support clinical decisions.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for
AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

*Yang Hou,Minggu Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot face editing method using ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion that maintains identity and structural consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation through text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-guided diffusion models struggle with maintaining ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks, limiting their practical application for facial attribute manipulation.

Method: Decompose face representation into ID and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both inversion and reverse diffusion processes for independent control over ID and attributes.

Result: The method achieves strong ID preservation and structural consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation, supporting complex multi-attribute editing tasks using only text prompts without region-specific input.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot face editing method demonstrates practicality and effectiveness for maintaining identity consistency while enabling flexible attribute manipulation through text guidance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

TL;DR: Overview of the 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025, featuring traditional VOS and RVOS tracks plus a new Complex VOS (MOSEv2) track with increased difficulty through realistic scenarios like dense small objects, disappear/reappear events, and adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push video object segmentation beyond curated benchmarks by introducing more challenging and realistic scenarios that test long-term consistency and generalization capabilities in real-world conditions.

Method: The challenge uses three tracks: Classic VOS, Referring VOS, and new Complex VOS (MOSEv2) with enhanced difficulty. Standard J, F, and J&F metrics for traditional tracks, while MOSEv2 adopts J&F-dot as primary metric to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases.

Result: The challenge successfully evaluated state-of-the-art solutions and identified emerging trends including the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation techniques.

Conclusion: The 2025 LSVOS Challenge advances the field by introducing more realistic evaluation scenarios and highlights future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRANCK is a novel Source-Free Object Detection framework specifically designed for DETR models, featuring objectness score reweighting, contrastive learning with memory banks, uncertainty-weighted feature distillation, and dynamic teacher updating for enhanced domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFOD approaches are either limited to conventional object detection models like Faster R-CNN or lack tailored adaptations for novel Detection Transformer (DETR) architectures, creating a need for specialized DETR-compatible SFOD solutions.

Method: FRANCK consists of four key components: Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting for attention-based loss reweighting, Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank for class-wise feature enhancement, Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation for improved feature transfer, and Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval for better pseudo-label quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that FRANCK achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing enhanced robustness and generalization for DETR-based SFOD models.

Conclusion: FRANCK effectively adapts source-pre-trained DETR models to target domains and demonstrates superior compatibility and performance for DETR-based Source-Free Object Detection.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

*Xianlin Liu,Yan Gong,Bohao Li,Jiajing Huang,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A panoptic symbol spotting framework for CAD drawings that incorporates textual annotations and models spatial dependencies between geometric and textual primitives using a Transformer-based backbone with type-aware attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD drawing analysis methods overlook textual annotations and lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, leading to incomprehensive understanding of holistic drawings.

Method: Constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Uses pretrained CNN for initial visual features, then employs Transformer-based backbone with type-aware attention to model different types of spatial dependencies between primitives.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations and exhibits superior robustness on complex CAD drawings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating textual annotations and explicit relationship modeling, achieving better performance and robustness in CAD drawing analysis.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Jingyu Li,Xiatian Zhu,Jiankang Deng,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeerDrive is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods operate under a one-shot paradigm that underestimates scene dynamics and temporal evolution, limiting adaptive decision-making in complex scenarios. The bidirectional relationship between vehicle trajectory and evolving environment dynamics motivates joint modeling.

Method: Proposes SeerDrive with two key components: (1) future-aware planning that injects predicted BEV features into trajectory planning, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning that refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner enables more informed and adaptive autonomous driving decisions.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Fengling Zhu,Boshi Liu,Jingyu Hua,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes supervised diffusion-based denoising with prompt optimization to defend MLLMs against adversarial attacks on visual modality, achieving improved robustness and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual modality manipulation, and existing defenses like adversarial training and input purification have limitations in computational cost, image quality degradation, and generalization.

Method: Supervised diffusion-based denoising framework using paired adversarial-clean image datasets with directional task-specific guidance, combined with prompt optimization as complementary defense.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial robustness improvement in image captioning and VQA tasks, with strong transferability to unknown attacks and higher quality reconstructions compared to unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: Supervised diffusion-based denoising effectively enhances MLLM security and reliability against multimodal adversarial threats, enabling safer real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive survey on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), categorizing methods into four families based on disentanglement approaches and analyzing their strengths/limitations across different problem settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CZSL addresses the combinatorial challenge of recognizing unseen attribute-object combinations by leveraging known primitives, which is crucial since visual appearances of primitives are highly contextual (e.g., 'small' cats vs 'older' cats, 'wet' cars vs 'wet' cats).

Method: The survey systematically reviews state-of-the-art CZSL methods using a taxonomy grounded in disentanglement: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement.

Result: The paper provides detailed comparative analysis of CZSL methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different problem settings (closed-world and open-world CZSL), and identifies significant open challenges.

Conclusion: This survey serves as a foundational resource to guide and inspire further advancements in CZSL, with available code and papers on their GitHub repository.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

TL;DR: Learning 3D motion priors from real videos to predict future 3D scene motion from a single image using pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image by learning semantically and functionally meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos.

Method: Proposed pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion, created a large-scale database from 50,000+ real videos, and trained a diffusion model on these representations. Also introduced a pipeline for 2D video synthesis: generate MoMap first, then warp image accordingly.

Result: The approach generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion, demonstrating effective motion prediction capabilities.

Conclusion: The MoMap representation combined with diffusion modeling provides an effective framework for learning 3D motion priors and enabling future scene motion prediction from single images.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro is a framework that disentangles static and dynamic features in sequential chest X-rays and aligns them with EHR data to model disease progression, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal multimodal data (EHR and CXRs) is underutilized due to redundancy in CXR sequences and temporal misalignment between sparse imaging and continuous EHR data.

Method: Region-aware disentanglement of static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology) CXR features, followed by hierarchical alignment with EHR data via local (interval-level) and global (sequence-level) synchronization.

Result: Extensive experiments on MIMIC dataset show DiPro effectively extracts temporal clinical dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance on disease progression identification and ICU prediction tasks.

Conclusion: DiPro successfully addresses challenges in multimodal longitudinal data by disentangling clinically meaningful dynamics and aligning asynchronous data sources for improved disease progression modeling.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: SynTrans is a novel few-shot learning framework that transfers diverse knowledge from large multimodal models to enhance few-shot learners through synergistic knowledge mining and bi-directional visual-semantic knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods that use semantic knowledge from smaller models often introduce noise and bias due to data simplicity, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses CLIP as teacher and few-shot vision encoder as student, with unsupervised proxy task for knowledge distillation. Includes synergistic knowledge mining, visual-semantic bridging, and adaptive multimodal classifier construction.

Result: Significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on four FSL datasets, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision encoder.

Conclusion: SynTrans effectively leverages large multimodal models to enhance few-shot learning through synergistic knowledge transfer and multimodal classifier construction.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaling up diffusion models and datasets alone fails to improve counting accuracy; noise initialization biases cause numerosity failures, but injecting count-aware layout information into noise prior significantly improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether diffusion models can inherently generate correct object counts specified in text prompts through scaling, and to address the numerosity challenge in text-to-image generation models.

Method: Constructed synthetic numerosity benchmark with GrayCount250 and NaturalCount6 datasets; analyzed scaling effects; proposed injecting count-aware layout information into noise prior to control numerosity.

Result: Scaling hypothesis disproved - larger models/datasets didn't improve counting accuracy; noise priors exhibit object count biases; proposed method improved accuracy from 20.0% to 85.3% on GrayCount250 and from 74.8% to 86.3% on NaturalCount6.

Conclusion: Diffusion models' numerosity failures stem from noise initialization biases rather than scaling limitations; count-aware layout injection effectively addresses counting accuracy issues and generalizes well across settings.

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S is a streaming audio-visual LLM that processes 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under fixed memory budget, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-understanding LLMs struggle to scale for continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams. Offline methods require adapting frame rates, while streaming methods lose information by merging or discarding tokens.

Method: Introduces (i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations to capture long-range dependencies, replacing token merging, and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module uses Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation.

Result: Achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines. Sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens.

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S successfully addresses the scalability challenge for long video processing, enabling continuous streaming of 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under fixed memory constraints while maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), which is critical for male fertility assessment. Current methods require destructive testing.

Method: Morphology-assisted ensemble AI model combining image processing with transformer-based machine learning (GC-ViT) to predict DNA fragmentation from phase contrast images, using TUNEL assay as gold standard.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 60% sensitivity and 75% specificity in detecting sperm DNA fragmentation, outperforming pure transformer and morphology-only models.

Conclusion: This non-destructive AI methodology enables real-time sperm selection based on DNA integrity, representing a significant advancement for reproductive medicine in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

*Junfei Shi,Haojia Zhang,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Xiaogang Song,Yuanfan Guo,Haonan Su,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multiview fusion method called MMEFnet that combines PolSAR covariance matrices and multi-features using manifold learning and evidence theory for more reliable and interpretable classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fusion methods overlook the geometric differences between covariance matrices and multi-features, ignore view importance variations, and lack uncertainty quantification, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: Represent covariance matrices on HPD manifold and multi-features on Grassmann manifold, use kernel metric learning networks, apply trusted multiview evidence fusion with belief mass estimation, and combine using Dempster-Shafer theory.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets show superior performance in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MMEFnet effectively addresses geometric structure differences and uncertainty issues in multiview fusion, providing a more reliable and interpretable classification framework for PolSAR data.

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

### [320] [CoPRS: Learning Positional Prior from Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11173)
*Zhenyu Lu,Liupeng Li,Jinpeng Wang,Yan Feng,Bin Chen,Ke Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPRS introduces a multi-modal Chain-of-Thought approach that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable heatmap positional prior, improving interpretability and achieving state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO and ReasonSeg benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either connect language model features directly to mask decoders or use text position representations, which limits interpretability and semantic detail in reasoning segmentation tasks.

Method: Uses a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) approach with a learnable concentration token to generate a differentiable heatmap positional prior, which is then decoded to precise masks through a lightweight decoder, creating a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.

Result: Matches or surpasses best reported metrics on RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg under comparable protocols, achieving performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test partitions.

Conclusion: The heatmap quality strongly influences mask quality, supporting consistent association between reasoning output and downstream mask generation, demonstrating advantages in concentration and precise mask prediction through reasoning-driven segmentation.

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

### [321] [Reliable Cross-modal Alignment via Prototype Iterative Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11175)
*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a novel framework that suppresses style interference in cross-modal alignment by quantifying semantic probability of feature columns and using it as weights during embedding interaction, with a prototype iterative construction method to ensure reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cross-modal alignment methods assume embeddings contain only semantic information, ignoring non-semantic style information that causes information bias and loss during alignment.

Method: Proposes PICO framework that quantifies probability of each feature column representing semantic information and uses it as weights during embedding interaction. Uses prototype iterative construction with performance feedback-based weighting function.

Result: Extensive experiments show PICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.2%-14.1% across various benchmarks and model backbones.

Conclusion: PICO effectively suppresses style interference in cross-modal alignment by separating semantic and style information through semantic probability weighting and reliable prototype construction.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

### [322] [G2L:From Giga-Scale to Cancer-Specific Large-Scale Pathology Foundation Models via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11176)
*Yesung Cho,Sungmin Lee,Geongyu Lee,Minkyung Lee,Jongbae Park,Dongmyung Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The G2L framework uses knowledge distillation to boost large-scale pathology models (15% of giga-scale parameters) to match giga-scale performance using only 1K cancer-specific slides, achieving superior results with better robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Giga-scale pathology foundation models have prohibitive computational costs for practical use despite their superior performance, creating a need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: Knowledge distillation framework (G2L) that transfers capabilities from giga-scale models to large-scale models using only 1,000 pathology slides of target cancer types.

Result: Distilled models outperformed same-size state-of-the-art models, surpassed giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks, and showed higher robustness to multi-institutional image variations.

Conclusion: The distillation approach provides a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without the computational burden of giga-scale models.

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

### [323] [BLEnD-Vis: Benchmarking Multimodal Cultural Understanding in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11178)
*Bryan Chen Zhengyu Tan,Zheng Weihua,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Hwaran Lee,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis is a multimodal benchmark that evaluates cultural knowledge robustness in VLMs across linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities, revealing significant fragility in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs are deployed globally, there's a need to assess their cultural understanding beyond static recall, particularly their robustness across different modalities and linguistic variations.

Method: Built on BLEnD dataset, creates 313 culturally grounded question templates across 16 regions, generating three multiple-choice formats: text-only baseline, inverted text variant, and VQA-style with generated images, totaling 4,916 images and 21,000+ MCQ instances.

Result: Current VLMs show significant fragility in cultural knowledge with performance drops under linguistic rephrasing, low cross-modal consistency, and particular challenges for lower-resource regions despite visual cues sometimes helping.

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis provides a crucial testbed for analyzing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Saudi Sign Language translation by leveraging large-scale ASL data and addressing unique SSL challenges like face coverings.

Method: Used T5 models with novel SSL dataset containing three testing protocols, comparing models pre-trained on YouTubeASL dataset vs. direct SSL training.

Result: Pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improved performance (roughly 3x in BLEU-4), showing effective cross-linguistic transfer.

Conclusion: Leveraging large-scale ASL data benefits SSL translation, providing insights for more effective sign language translation systems.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [325] [FlexAC: Towards Flexible Control of Associative Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11190)
*Shengming Yuan,Xinyu Lyu,Shuailong Wang,Beitao Chen,Jingkuan Song,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexAC is a training-free framework that enables flexible control over associative reasoning in multimodal LLMs by modulating middle layer representations using hallucination-guided steering vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face a trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, but existing methods lack flexibility to modulate associative reasoning strength for different tasks requiring varying degrees of factual accuracy vs. creative association.

Method: FlexAC identifies middle layers as key for associative behavior, induces hallucination-guided representations to encode associative directions, constructs steering vectors from high-association instances, and incorporates task-specific vectors from target-domain samples.

Result: Achieves 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: FlexAC effectively enables flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs, balancing creative guidance with output stability across different task requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal approach for detecting educational content in online videos, focusing on literacy and math content for early childhood education using supervised contrastive learning with class prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing consumption of online media by children necessitates data-driven tools to filter appropriate educational content for young learners, particularly literacy and math content.

Method: Proposes a class prototypes-based supervised contrastastive learning approach with multimodal transformer network to capture visual-audio interactions, treating the problem as fine-grained multilabel classification.

Result: The approach outperforms strong baselines on the APPROVE dataset (193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes) and other benchmarks like Youtube-8M and COIN.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal contrastive learning method effectively detects educational content in videos and the APPROVE dataset provides a valuable resource for educational content filtering research.

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

*Masoumeh Chapariniya,Pierre Vuillecard,Jean-Marc Odobez,Volker Dellwo,Teodora Vukovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that individuals can be identified solely through their facial expression dynamics, independent of static facial appearance, achieving 61.14% accuracy on 1,429-way classification using disentangled expression parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether facial dynamics alone carry identity signatures, separate from static facial features, and understand how reliable shape-expression separation affects dynamic identification.

Method: Used FLAME 3D morphable model to disentangle facial shape and expression dynamics, extracted frame-by-frame expression parameters from conversational videos, and trained a Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning on the CANDOR dataset.

Result: Achieved 61.14% accuracy on 1,429-way classification (458 times above chance), demonstrating strong identity signatures in facial dynamics. Introduced drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that negatively correlates with recognition performance.

Conclusion: Facial dynamics contain person-specific signatures that enable identification independent of static appearance, with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest

Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked

Motivation: Current skip connection methods in medical image segmentation struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios.

Method: DTEA model with two key modules: STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into dynamic hypergraph to model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies; EPG assesses channel stability after perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically important regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show superior segmentation accuracy and better generalization across various clinical settings compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DTEA framework with STR and EPG modules effectively addresses limitations in current skip connection approaches, achieving improved performance and generalization in medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient

propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic

perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated framework for SEM scale bar detection using multi-modal approach with object detection, OCR, and LLM verification to replace manual operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scale bar detection in SEM images is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring automated solutions for accurate microscopic analysis.

Method: Four-phase framework: 1) Auto-DG dataset generation, 2) scale bar object detection, 3) hybrid OCR with DenseNet and CRNN, 4) LLM agent for verification and analysis.

Result: Object detection achieved 100% precision, 95.8% recall, 99.2% mAP@0.5; OCR achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, 75% F1 score, outperforming mainstream engines.

Conclusion: The automated LLM-powered framework significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy of SEM scale bar detection, advancing scientific imaging analysis.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for

### [332] [Exploring and Leveraging Class Vectors for Classifier Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11268)
*Jaeik Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Class Vectors, a method for flexible editing of image classifiers by capturing class-specific representation adjustments in latent space, enabling efficient model editing without extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classifier editing methods are limited - they either focus narrowly on error correction or require extensive retraining, creating a bottleneck for flexible editing in image classification applications like medical imaging and manufacturing anomaly detection.

Method: Class Vectors capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning, disentangling each class's adaptation in latent space. Editing is achieved by steering latent features along these vectors or mapping them to weight space to update decision boundaries.

Result: Class Vectors effectively capture semantic shifts for each class and demonstrate inherent linearity and orthogonality, supporting efficient concept editing through simple class arithmetic. They enable applications like unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and trigger optimization.

Conclusion: Class Vectors provide an efficient and flexible approach for post hoc model editing in image classifiers, overcoming limitations of existing methods while supporting various practical applications without extensive retraining costs.

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EEMS is a new medical image segmentation model that combines edge-aware enhancement and multi-scale prompt generation to improve boundary definition and target localization, achieving superior performance on datasets like ISIC2018.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges from ambiguous edges and background noise, which affect diagnosis and treatment planning accuracy.

Method: Combines Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) for multi-frequency edge feature extraction, Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU) for semantic-spatial feature integration, and Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) to merge edge and semantic features.

Result: Tests on ISIC2018 dataset confirm superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

Conclusion: EEMS provides enhanced segmentation accuracy and robustness for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

*Jian Lan,Zhicheng Liu,Udo Schlegel,Raoyuan Zhao,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HaDola is a human uncertainty-aware framework that improves VLM training by selectively using high-uncertainty samples and automatic labeling, achieving better performance with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning ignores human uncertainty in annotations, leading to under-calibrated models and inefficient use of training data.

Method: Four-stage framework: discriminate harmful samples, self-annotate, error trigger, and iterative training using only 5% seed data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on VQAv2 and VizWiz with less training data, improving both accuracy and calibration.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling human uncertainty is more effective than scaling dataset size, enabling better VLM performance with reduced annotation costs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

### [335] [$Δ\mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11296)
*Lin Zhu,Yifeng Yang,Xinbing Wang,Qinying Gu,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ΔEnergy, a novel OOD score for vision-language models that improves both OOD detection and generalization by leveraging energy changes during modality realignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs encounter both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data in real-world applications, including covariate shifts (style changes) and semantic shifts (unseen classes). Current methods need better generalization to covariate-shifted OOD data while effectively detecting semantic-shifted OOD classes.

Method: Proposed ΔEnergy OOD score based on energy changes during vision-language modality realignment, and EBM (lower-bound maximization for ΔEnergy) framework that theoretically improves OOD generalization by creating domain-consistent Hessian.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority over recent approaches, outperforming them by 10% to 25% in AUROC on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: ΔEnergy provides a unified framework that simultaneously enhances VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection, addressing both covariate and semantic shifts effectively.

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

### [336] [When Does Supervised Training Pay Off? The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11302)
*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised object detection (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5), establishing quantitative break-even thresholds for architecture selection based on deployment volume, category stability, and budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive comparison between traditional supervised object detection (requiring expensive manual annotations) and emerging zero-shot VLM approaches (eliminating annotations but with lower accuracy), helping practitioners make informed decisions about architecture selection.

Method: Systematic evaluation on 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling to establish quantitative break-even thresholds for architecture selection.

Result: Supervised YOLO achieves 91.2% accuracy vs 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, but requires $10,800 in annotations for 100-category systems. The advantage justifies investment only beyond 55 million inferences. Gemini shows 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories where YOLO achieves 0% due to architectural constraints. Cost per Correct Detection is substantially lower for Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences.

Conclusion: Optimal architecture selection depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics, with zero-shot VLM approaches being more cost-effective for lower-volume deployments and dynamic category requirements.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

TL;DR: Sketch2Symm is a two-stage method that generates geometrically consistent 3D shapes from sparse sketches using semantic bridging and symmetry constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction is challenging due to the abstract and sparse nature of sketch inputs that lack sufficient semantic and geometric information.

Method: Two-stage generation with semantic bridging via sketch-to-image translation to enrich sparse representations, and symmetry constraints as geometric priors to leverage structural regularity.

Result: Superior performance compared to existing methods on mainstream sketch datasets in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score.

Conclusion: The semantic bridging and symmetry-aware design effectively address the challenges of sketch-based 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

### [338] [Evaluating the effects of preprocessing, method selection, and hyperparameter tuning on SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11305)
*Jean-Paul Travert,Cédric Goeury,Sébastien Boyaval,Vito Bacchi,Fabrice Zaoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation methods, showing that method choices and hyperparameters significantly impact results. Ensemble approaches are recommended over single configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods affect flood mapping accuracy and water depth estimation from SAR imagery.

Method: Used SAR imagery to evaluate ensemble of preprocessing methods (speckle noise reduction), flood mapping methods, and water depth estimation methods. Compared supervised vs unsupervised approaches on two Garonne River flood events using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ observations as reference.

Result: Speckle filter choice altered flood extent by several km². Supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, but tuned unsupervised approaches achieved comparable results. Methodological uncertainty from preprocessing and flood mapping introduced high variability in water depth estimates.

Conclusion: The entire processing pipeline matters - preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods with their hyperparameters. Ensemble approaches should be preferred over single configurations to account for methodological uncertainty.

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in general SVG modeling including fragmented datasets, limited transferability across tasks, and difficulty handling structural complexity by leveraging MLLMs' transfer and generalization capabilities.

Method: Propose InternSVG with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and two-stage training from short static SVGs to complex animations. Introduce SAgoge dataset (largest SVG dataset) and SArena benchmark.

Result: InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts on SArena and prior benchmarks, demonstrating positive transfer and improved overall performance.

Conclusion: The unified MLLM approach with comprehensive dataset and benchmark enables effective SVG understanding, editing, and generation, overcoming previous limitations in SVG modeling.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAP is a novel framework that uses multi-magnification patch representations and prototype embeddings to predict spatial gene expression from H&E-stained whole-slide images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatial gene expression from histological images is challenging due to the modality gap between visual features and molecular signals, and existing methods suffer from insufficient local feature granularity and inadequate global spatial context coverage.

Method: MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations to capture fine-grained histological details for local feature extraction, and learns latent prototype embeddings as compact representations of slide-level information for global contextual understanding.

Result: MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).

Conclusion: The proposed MMAP framework effectively addresses both local feature granularity and global spatial context challenges in predicting spatial gene expression from histological images.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocReward is a document reward model that evaluates documents based on structure and style rather than just textual quality, trained on a large multi-domain dataset to guide agentic workflows toward producing more professional-looking documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic workflows for document generation focus primarily on textual quality but neglect visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. There's a gap in suitable reward models to guide workflows toward better structural and stylistic quality.

Method: Constructed DocPair dataset with 117K paired documents across 32 domains and 267 document types, each containing high- and low-professionalism versions with identical content but different structure/style. Trained DocReward using Bradley-Terry loss to score documents and penalize predictions that contradict human rankings.

Result: DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points respectively. In document generation evaluation, DocReward achieves 60.8% win rate vs GPT-5's 37.7%, demonstrating superior ability to guide generation toward human-preferred documents.

Conclusion: DocReward effectively addresses the gap in evaluating document structure and style, providing a powerful reward model that significantly improves the quality of documents generated by agentic workflows compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

*Joshua Niemeijer,Jan Ehrhardt,Heinz Handels,Hristina Uzunova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-guided ControlNet that uses unlabeled domain data to create synthetic annotated datasets, improving segmentation performance on domain-shifted data without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets reproduce original training distributions, limiting their effectiveness for domain adaptation. The need to handle domain shifts in medical imaging (retinal OCTs) and other applications where labeled target domain data is unavailable.

Method: Introduces uncertainty into ControlNet's control mechanism, combining uncertainty control from unlabeled datasets with semantic control from labeled datasets to generate annotated synthetic data from target domains.

Result: The approach significantly improves segmentation results on Home-OCT retinal images with large domain shifts, outperforming style transfer methods and enabling arbitrary domain shifts without strict style learning.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guided ControlNets effectively bridge domain gaps by generating high-quality synthetic annotated data from unlabeled target domains, improving downstream task performance without additional supervision.

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

*Shijie Zhao,Xuanyu Zhang,Weiqi Li,Junlin Li,Li Zhang,Tianfan Xue,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALI uses contrastive learning to align images with generalizable text representations from RL-trained IQA models, achieving comparable generalization with 95% fewer parameters and inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-trained IQA models show great generalization but suffer from high inference energy and latency, limiting deployment. The mechanisms behind their generalization are not well understood.

Method: Proposed RALI algorithm that uses contrastive learning to directly align images with the compact, cross-domain aligned text representations learned by RL-trained models, eliminating the need for reasoning processes and LLM loading.

Result: RALI achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based IQA models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.

Conclusion: The generalization of reasoning-based IQA models comes from converting visual representations to compact text representations, and this can be directly achieved through contrastive learning without expensive reasoning processes.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters

*Wenyuan Zhang,Jimin Tang,Weiqi Zhang,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for modeling reflections in 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting with multi-view consistent material inference and physically-based environment modeling to achieve accurate reflections and photorealistic rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using Gaussian primitives for reflection modeling often lack sufficient constraints, leading to illumination aliasing and reduced generalization, especially under limited environment modeling.

Method: Enforces 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading, tracks photometric variations across views to identify reflective regions, and introduces ray tracing with 2DGS for environment modeling to handle indirect illumination.

Result: Experiments show faithful recovery of both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel view synthesis on widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-view consistent material inference with physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting, enabling photorealistic rendering.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

*Yijun Hu,Bing Fan,Xin Gu,Haiqing Ren,Dongfang Liu,Heng Fan,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LM-EEC is a novel ego-exo correspondence framework that enhances SAM 2 with long-term memory architecture and adaptive feature routing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EgoExo4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for ego-exo correspondence face challenges like extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and small objects. SAM 2 shows promise but struggles with ineffective feature fusion and limited long-term memory capacity for long videos.

Method: Proposes a dual-memory architecture with compression strategy and a Memory-View MoE module that uses dual-branch routing to adaptively assign weights to expert features along channel and spatial dimensions.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on EgoExo4D benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods and SAM 2 baseline, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed LM-EEC framework effectively addresses SAM 2's limitations in ego-exo correspondence through long-term memory and adaptive feature routing, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

*Geoffery Agorku,Sarah Hernandez,Hayley Hames,Cade Wagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework fusing satellite imagery with AIS data for inland waterway surveillance, using YOLO v11 to detect vessels and identify dark vessels, with high accuracy across multiple classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced Maritime Domain Awareness for inland waterways.

Method: Fusion of high-resolution satellite imagery with AIS trajectory data using YOLO v11 object detection model to detect vessels and classify by type, barge cover, operational status, direction, and count. Developed annotated dataset from 5,973 mi² of Lower Mississippi River imagery.

Result: High performance across tasks: vessel classification F1=95.8%, barge cover detection F1=91.6%, operational status F1=99.4%, directionality accuracy=93.8%, barge count MAE=2.4. Spatial transferability maintained 98% accuracy across disjoint river segments.

Conclusion: Integration of non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion is viable and enables near-real-time fleet inventories, anomaly detection, and high-quality inland waterway surveillance. Future work includes expanding datasets, temporal tracking, and multi-modal deep learning.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGDCFusion is a novel infrared and visible image fusion method that couples degradation modeling with fusion, using vision-language models for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression to handle degraded images effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods assume high-quality inputs and require manual pre-processing for degraded images, leading to performance issues due to decoupled degradation handling and fusion processes.

Method: Proposes VGDCFusion with two key components: Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) for modality-specific degradation awareness and joint modeling, and Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) for cross-modal degradation perception and residual degradation filtering.

Result: Extensive experiments show VGDCFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully couples degradation modeling with fusion process and leverages VLMs for effective degradation-aware image fusion, providing superior performance on degraded images.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our

*Qing Li,Huifang Feng,Xun Gong,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes view alignment method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting for better surface reconstruction by incorporating edge-aware rendering, visibility-aware photometric alignment, normal constraints, and deep feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting excels at novel view synthesis but struggles with accurate surface reconstruction due to discrete Gaussians and image-only supervision leading to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.

Method: Incorporates edge-aware image cues, visibility-aware photometric alignment loss to handle occlusions, normal-based constraints for spatial orientation, and deep image feature embeddings for cross-view consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed view alignment method significantly improves geometric representation of 3D Gaussians while maintaining high-quality rendering capabilities.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel normal integration method that treats the problem as estimating relative scales of continuous components, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant speed improvements over pixel-level approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal integration methods require iterative global optimization at the pixel level, which scales poorly to larger normal maps and becomes computationally expensive.

Method: Recasts normal integration as estimating relative scales of continuous components, uses heuristics to identify components, rebalances optimization terms, and iteratively merges components to reduce problem size.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks in seconds, with one-order-of-magnitude speedup over pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Conclusion: The component-based approach provides an efficient and scalable solution to normal integration, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

TL;DR: Situat3DChange is a comprehensive 3D dataset for situation-aware change understanding, featuring 121K QA pairs, 36K change descriptions, and 17K rearrangement instructions. It addresses limitations in current 3D datasets by combining dynamic scenarios and situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D datasets focus on either dynamic scenarios or situations in isolation, leading to incomplete understanding of environmental changes. There's a need for comprehensive datasets that support human-AI collaboration through shared mental models.

Method: Leveraged 11K human observations with egocentric/allocentric perspectives and spatial relations, integrated using LLM. Proposed SCReasoner - an efficient 3D MLLM for point cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene understanding. Data scaling and cross-domain experiments demonstrate Situat3DChange's task-agnostic effectiveness as training data for MLLMs.

Conclusion: Situat3DChange successfully bridges the gap in 3D change understanding datasets and enables effective human-AI collaboration through shared situational awareness, while SCReasoner provides an efficient solution for 3D change detection.

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

TL;DR: LikePhys is a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using denoising objective as a likelihood surrogate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to accurately evaluate physics understanding in video diffusion models due to difficulty disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in generated videos.

Method: Uses denoising objective as ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on curated dataset of valid-invalid video pairs, with Plausibility Preference Error (PPE) metric tested on 12 scenarios across 4 physics domains.

Result: PPE demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. Models show clear improvement in physics understanding as capacity and inference settings scale, though struggle with complex chaotic dynamics.

Conclusion: LikePhys provides effective evaluation of intuitive physics in video diffusion models, revealing domain-specific capacity variations and scaling trends in physics understanding.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Motivation: Address the challenge of walking assistance in complex environments for BLV users by providing holistic scene understanding through multi-modal data integration.

Method: Created mmWalk dataset with 120 manually controlled walking trajectories (62k frames) containing panoramic RGB, depth, and semantic images, plus mmWalkVQA benchmark with 69k question-answer triplets across 9 safety categories.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs struggled with risk assessment and navigational tasks in zero- and few-shot settings, but mmWalk-finetuned models showed effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The mmWalk dataset advances multi-modal walking assistance research by providing comprehensive accessibility-oriented data and benchmarks for developing better navigation aids for BLV users.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing

TL;DR: The paper investigates Massive Activations (MAs) in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and proposes Detail Guidance (DG), a training-free method to enhance local detail synthesis in visual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive Activations in DiTs' internal feature maps are poorly understood, and the authors aim to systematically investigate their role in visual generation.

Method: The authors propose Detail Guidance (DG), which constructs a degraded 'detail-deficient' model by disrupting MAs and uses it to guide the original network toward better detail synthesis. DG can integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG).

Result: DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs (SD3, SD3.5, Flux) without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: Massive Activations play a key role in local detail synthesis, and the proposed DG method effectively enhances detail fidelity in DiT-based visual generation systems.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

TL;DR: ODI-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for omnidirectional image understanding, containing 2,000 images and 4,000 QA pairs across 10 tasks. Current MLLMs struggle with ODI comprehension, so Omni-CoT is introduced as a training-free method using chain-of-thought reasoning to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance on 2D images and videos, but their ability to understand immersive omnidirectional images (ODIs) used in VR, AR and embodied intelligence remains unexplored.

Method: Created ODI-Bench with 2,000 ODIs and 4,000 QA pairs across 10 tasks. Benchmarked 20 MLLMs and introduced Omni-CoT, a training-free chain-of-thought method that leverages both textual and visual cues for enhanced ODI understanding.

Result: Experimental results show current MLLMs struggle to capture immersive context in ODIs. Omni-CoT significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in omnidirectional environments.

Conclusion: The work addresses a critical gap in MLLM capabilities for ODI understanding, provides a comprehensive benchmark, and offers an effective training-free solution to improve performance on immersive visual content.

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Method: Systematically evaluate power-law fits to predict training size for specific ROC-AUC thresholds, testing multiple pathologies and foundation models including XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP.

Result: XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than ResNet-50 baseline. Learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus.

Conclusion: Results enable practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only essential samples for targeted performance, making chest X-ray classification more efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNAP is a unified model for interactive 3D point cloud segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains (indoor, outdoor, aerial), achieving state-of-the-art performance through cross-domain training and domain-adaptive normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation approaches are limited to single domains and single interaction types, often suffering from negative transfer when trained on multiple datasets, leading to domain-specific tools that lack generalizability.

Method: Train on 7 datasets spanning multiple domains using domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text-prompted segmentation, automatically generate mask proposals and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries.

Result: Achieves SOTA on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks. Demonstrates that unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific approaches.

Conclusion: SNAP provides a practical unified tool for scalable 3D annotation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains with strong cross-domain generalizability.

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that adapts diffusion models to generate high-fidelity, domain-aligned images from synthetic semantic maps using imperfect pseudo-labels, transforming low-effort synthetic data into effective training sets for urban scene recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic datasets for urban scene recognition show noticeable gaps from real imagery, especially when adapting to specific target domains like Cityscapes. Traditional approaches require expensive 3D modeling and manual design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labeled data.

Method: Adapts off-the-shelf diffusion models to target domains using only imperfect pseudo-labels. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardizes semantics across datasets to transform weak synthetic data into competitive training sets.

Result: Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive alternatives.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping combined with generative models enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding, bridging the gap between synthetic and real imagery effectively.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

### [361] [MS-Mix: Unveiling the Power of Mixup for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11579)
*Hongyu Zhu,Lin Chen,Mounim A. El-Yacoubi,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-Mix is an emotion-sensitive multimodal data augmentation framework that addresses label ambiguity in sentiment analysis by using sentiment-aware sample selection, dynamic mixing ratios based on emotional intensity, and sentiment alignment loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mixup-based augmentation methods for multimodal sentiment analysis suffer from label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency when randomly mixing samples with contradictory emotions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes MS-Mix with three key components: Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection to prevent semantic confusion, Sentiment Intensity Guided module for dynamic mixing ratios, and Sentiment Alignment Loss for modality prediction consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six state-of-the-art backbones show MS-Mix consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing new standards for robust multimodal sentiment augmentation.

Conclusion: MS-Mix effectively addresses the challenges of multimodal data augmentation by incorporating emotion-aware mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets and backbone networks.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

*Leonard Bruns,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Áron Monszpart,Sowmya Munukutla,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACE-G separates coordinate regression from map representation using a generic transformer and scene-specific map code, enabling pre-training on thousands of scenes for better generalization to unseen query images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods overfit to training views and fail to generalize to query images with different lighting or viewpoints, unlike feature-matching approaches.

Method: Proposes ACE-G framework that separates coordinate regressor and map representation into a generic transformer (pre-trained on thousands of scenes) and scene-specific map code, training the transformer to generalize from mapping to query images.

Result: Demonstrates significantly increased robustness on multiple challenging relocalization datasets while maintaining attractive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The separation of coordinate regression and map representation enables pre-training and better generalization, overcoming inherent limitations of previous SCR frameworks that overfit to training views by design.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpVid is a new benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on scientific experiment videos, revealing their limitations in fine-grained perception, procedural understanding, and scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't capture the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings, leaving MLLMs' true capabilities poorly understood.

Method: Created ExpVid benchmark from peer-reviewed video publications with a three-level task hierarchy: Fine-grained Perception, Procedural Understanding, and Scientific Reasoning. Used vision-centric annotation pipeline with automated generation and multi-disciplinary expert validation.

Result: Evaluation of 19 leading MLLMs shows they excel at coarse-grained recognition but struggle with fine details, state tracking over time, and linking procedures to outcomes. Notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, especially in high-order reasoning.

Conclusion: ExpVid provides a diagnostic tool and roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation by addressing current limitations in fine-grained understanding and scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

TL;DR: LLF-LUT++ is a pyramid network that combines global and local operators for efficient photo enhancement, achieving both high performance and fast processing of high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing photo enhancement methods either focus on performance but are too heavy for edge devices, or prioritize efficiency but lack adequate performance for real-world applications.

Method: Uses closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction with image-adaptive 3D LUT for global tonal enhancement, spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor for weight extraction, and local Laplacian filters for edge detail refinement.

Result: Achieves 2.64 dB PSNR improvement on HDR+ dataset, processes 4K images in 13 ms on a single GPU, and performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++ successfully balances performance and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world photo enhancement applications while maintaining high quality results.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

TL;DR: EvoCAD combines vision language models with evolutionary optimization to generate CAD objects through symbolic representations, outperforming previous methods on topological correctness using novel Euler characteristic-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the generative capabilities of large language models with evolutionary algorithms for creating computer-aided design objects, addressing the need for topologically correct CAD generation.

Method: Samples multiple CAD objects and optimizes them using evolutionary approach with vision language and reasoning language models (GPT-4V and GPT-4o), evaluated on CADPrompt benchmark with novel topological metrics.

Result: EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in generating topologically correct objects, with novel Euler characteristic-based metrics effectively complementing existing spatial metrics.

Conclusion: The combination of LLMs with evolutionary computation shows promise for CAD generation, with EvoCAD demonstrating superior performance in topological correctness using the introduced Euler characteristic metrics.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

*Krittin Chaowakarn,Paramin Sangwongngam,Nang Htet Htet Aung,Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NV3D is a 3D object detection method that uses normal vectors from voxel neighbors to improve feature representation, with sampling strategies that reduce data by 55% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal methods face feature alignment challenges and local feature extraction can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks.

Method: Extracts local features using normal vectors computed per voxel basis with KNN and PCA, offers two sampling strategies (density-based and FOV-aware bin-based), and uses element-wise attention fusion with voxel features as query/value and normal vectors as key.

Result: Achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mAP for car and cyclist detection on KITTI validation set, outperforming baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% respectively. With sampling, achieves 85.54% mAP for cars while filtering 55% of voxels.

Conclusion: NV3D demonstrates superior performance in 3D object detection, particularly for objects with distinct spatial shapes like cars and cyclists, while enabling significant data reduction through sampling strategies.

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate IVEBench's effectiveness in benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Conclusion: IVEBench successfully addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks and provides a modern, comprehensive evaluation suite for instruction-guided video editing methods.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhySIC reconstructs metrically accurate 3D humans and scenes from single images by addressing depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physical inconsistencies through occlusion-aware inpainting, confidence-weighted optimization, and explicit contact modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts in single-image 3D reconstruction, limiting applications in virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: PhySIC starts with coarse monocular depth and body estimates, performs occlusion-aware inpainting, fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry, synthesizes missing support surfaces, and uses confidence-weighted optimization to refine body pose, camera parameters, and global scale while enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D reprojection consistency.

Result: PhySIC significantly outperforms baselines, reducing mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm, and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. It handles multiple humans efficiently (9s for optimization, <27s end-to-end).

Conclusion: PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding by converting single images into physically plausible 3D human-scene pairs with realistic interactions and occlusion handling.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Motivation: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is challenging due to the high cost and limited diversity of manually captured datasets. The paper aims to leverage existing foundation models to create theoretically unbounded human data.

Method: Proposes InfiniHumanData pipeline using vision-language and image generation models to create large-scale multi-modal dataset, and InfiniHumanGen diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body shape, and clothing assets.

Result: Generated 111K identities with unprecedented diversity, indistinguishable from scan renderings in user studies. Achieved significant improvements in visual quality, generation speed, and controllability over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a practical and affordable solution, with plans to publicly release the pipeline, dataset, and models.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACE is a novel framework that improves concept-based explanations of deep neural networks by ensuring alignment between original and concept-based predictions through KL divergence regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to align extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process, compromising explanation faithfulness.

Method: Augments Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with KL divergence regularization and incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning to enforce predictive consistency.

Result: FACE outperforms existing methods across faithfulness and sparsity metrics on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed FACE framework provides more faithful concept-based explanations by ensuring predictive consistency through theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the

*Jinyu Zhang,Haitao Lin,Jiashu Hou,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from single RGB-D images without requiring CAD models or category labels, achieving real-time performance and strong zero-shot generalization across 300+ categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on object-specific priors like CAD models or suffer from limited generalization due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. There's a need for category-agnostic approaches that work across diverse objects.

Method: Fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using Transformer encoder enhanced by Mixture-of-Experts, with parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction. Trained on synthetic data from 149 categories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories and remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects across four benchmarks (SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, HANDAL) spanning 300+ categories. Runs at 28 FPS real-time inference.

Conclusion: Establishes a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI, demonstrating that category-agnostic approaches can achieve robust performance without object-specific priors.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

### [372] [Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11690)
*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Replacing traditional VAEs with Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) using pretrained representation encoders improves diffusion transformer training by providing higher-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DiTs rely on outdated VAE encoders with limitations including compromised architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces restricting information capacity, and weak representations from purely reconstruction-based training that limit generative quality.

Method: Proposed Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) using pretrained representation encoders (DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, with theoretical solutions to handle high-dimensional latent spaces and a DiT variant with lightweight DDT head.

Result: Achieved strong image generation on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 FID at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance), with faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses.

Conclusion: RAE offers clear advantages over traditional VAEs and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training due to improved latent space quality and generation performance.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

*Sarah Harkins Dayton,Hayden Everett,Ioannis Schizas,David L. Boothe Jr.,Vasileios Maroulas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Bayesian topological CNN that combines topology-aware learning with Bayesian sampling to improve training efficiency, reduce calibration error, and enhance uncertainty quantification in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CNNs require large training data, produce overconfident predictions, and lack uncertainty quantification. The paper aims to address these limitations by integrating topological learning with Bayesian methods.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian topological CNN that uses manifold information to accelerate training, places prior distributions on network parameters, learns appropriate posteriors, and includes a consistency condition in the learning cost to modify prior distributions.

Result: Superior performance over conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks, and topological CNNs on benchmark datasets, especially with limited or corrupted training data. Better uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution detection than standard BNNs.

Conclusion: The hybrid Bayesian topological approach shows potential for more efficient and robust image classification by effectively combining topology-aware learning with Bayesian uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

*Haoran Feng,Dizhe Zhang,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT360 is a DiT-based framework for panoramic image generation that uses hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data to address geometric fidelity and photorealism issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to overcome the lack of large-scale, high-quality real-world panoramic data, which previous methods haven't adequately addressed through data-centric approaches.

Method: Uses hybrid training with inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation at both image level (cross-domain knowledge through perspective guidance and panoramic refinement) and token level (circular padding, yaw loss, cube loss for boundary continuity, rotational robustness, and distortion awareness).

Result: Extensive experiments show better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics in text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks.

Conclusion: DiT360 effectively addresses panoramic image generation challenges through a data-centric hybrid training approach that combines perspective and panoramic data with specialized modules for geometric fidelity and photorealism.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained video diffusion models can perform zero-shot point tracking by prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time, outperforming prior zero-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trackers and video generators solve related problems - motion analysis vs synthesis. This connection enables using video diffusion models for tracking without additional training.

Method: Place a distinctively colored marker at query point, regenerate video from intermediate noise level to propagate marker across frames. Use unedited initial frame as negative prompt to keep marker visible.

Result: Emergent tracks outperform prior zero-shot methods, persist through occlusions, and achieve performance competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models can effectively perform zero-shot point tracking by leveraging their motion synthesis capabilities, demonstrating strong tracking performance without specialized training.

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

*Takuya Nakabayashi,Navami Kairanda,Hideo Saito,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ev4DGS is the first method for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects from monocular event streams alone, without requiring RGB inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based techniques for non-rigid objects require sparse RGB inputs, which limits practical applications. This paper explores whether similar models can be learned from event streams only.

Method: Regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation using: 1) a loss relating model outputs with 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events.

Result: Experimental comparisons on synthetic and real datasets show Ev4DGS is valid and outperforms multiple naive baselines applicable in this setting.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS successfully demonstrates novel view rendering of non-rigid objects from event streams alone, addressing a challenging open question in the field.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodePlot-CoT is a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm that enables visual reasoning in mathematics by generating executable plotting code that renders into images as "visual thought" to solve problems requiring visual assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and VLMs face limitations in solving mathematical problems that require visual assistance like drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions, as they are constrained to text-only reasoning chains and lack precision in multimodal generation.

Method: 1) Construct Math-VR, a large-scale bilingual dataset for mathematics with visual reasoning (178K samples); 2) Develop an image-to-code converter for parsing mathematical figures into code; 3) Train CodePlot-CoT model using generated training data to generate both text reasoning and executable plotting code.

Result: The model achieves up to 21% improvement over base models on the new benchmark, validating the efficacy of the code-driven reasoning paradigm for multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning by providing the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and strong approach, with all resources made publicly available to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: An end-to-end imaging solution combining ultra-thin metalens cameras with a multi-image restoration framework to overcome chromatic aberration, scattering, and efficiency limitations for practical in-the-wild deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metalens cameras offer dramatic size and weight reductions compared to conventional optics but suffer from severe chromatic aberration, light scattering, narrow bandwidth, and low efficiency, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Pairs a metalens with a bespoke multi-image restoration framework using a lightweight convolutional network and memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm that corrects noise, saturation, and lens distortions across rapid sequences of degraded captures.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world handheld captures show the approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image restoration techniques.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin
nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of
nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared
to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration,
pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light
efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present
an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several
times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration
framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a
lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion
algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced
distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures.
Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image
restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for
deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Multi-agent LLM systems show increased bias vulnerability compared to single agents, with early emergence through in-group favoritism, but cooperative communication and robust base models can mitigate bias amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how bias emerges and propagates in multi-agent LLM systems, which introduce new dynamics beyond individual model bias that are largely unexplored.

Method: Simulated social contexts with agents representing different social groups, evaluated on three bias benchmarks under various interaction and adversarial scenarios, analyzing internal specialization, underlying LLMs, and communication protocols.

Result: MAS are generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early through in-group favoritism, but cooperative/debate-based communication and more robust underlying LLMs can mitigate bias amplification and improve system stability.

Conclusion: Critical factors like communication protocols and base model robustness significantly shape fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems, highlighting the need for careful design to manage bias in collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge,
manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While
prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of
multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate,
introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and
propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical
bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and
inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and
amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different
social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and
adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are
generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early
through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based
communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying
LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors
shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods for cross-sensor tactile image generation to enable sensor-agnostic tactile representations, addressing the challenge of different visuo-tactile sensor designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visuo-tactile sensors have diverse designs, making it difficult to develop general-purpose tactile representations since most models are tied to specific sensor hardware.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Touch2Touch - end-to-end method using paired data, 2) T2D2 (Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch) - uses intermediate depth representation without requiring paired data.

Result: Both methods successfully enable sensor-specific models to work across multiple sensors through cross-sensor touch generation, demonstrated on downstream tasks like in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning.

Conclusion: The proposed models provide flexible solutions for sensor translation depending on data availability and application needs, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

TL;DR: Dejavu enables embodied agents to learn from experience post-deployment using an Experience Feedback Network that retrieves successful past actions to guide current decisions, improving adaptability without updating model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents cannot acquire new knowledge after deployment, limiting their ability to improve task performance in real-world environments.

Method: Uses an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) with reinforcement learning and semantic similarity rewards to retrieve successful past action experiences and condition current action predictions on this guidance.

Result: Significantly improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates across diverse embodied tasks compared to frozen baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a promising approach for creating embodied agents that can continually refine their behavior after deployment through experience-based learning.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

Conclusion: The soft prompt approach with minimal parameters effectively enables VLA models to leverage heterogeneous cross-embodiment data, providing scalable and simple architecture for generalist robotic learning.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B

TL;DR: SuperEx integrates non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing into robotic exploration using single-photon LiDARs to detect hidden objects around corners, improving mapping accuracy and exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot perception is limited to line-of-sight, making occluded regions unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration when layouts deviate from assumptions.

Method: Uses single-photon LiDARs to capture time-of-flight histograms, carves empty NLOS regions from timing data, and reconstructs occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach leveraging structural regularities.

Result: 12% gain in mapping accuracy under <30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight baselines on simulated maps and KTH Floorplan dataset.

Conclusion: Enables reliable mapping beyond direct visibility by integrating NLOS sensing into the mapping-exploration loop.

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

*Zhuoheng Gao,Jiyao Zhang,Zhiyong Xie,Hao Dong,Zhaofei Yu,Rongmei Chen,Guozhang Chen,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SpikeGrasp is a neuro-inspired 6-DoF grasp detection framework that processes raw stereo spike camera events directly without 3D point cloud reconstruction, using recurrent spiking neural networks to refine grasp poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic grasping relies on explicit 3D point clouds, which is computationally inefficient and biologically unnatural. The paper aims to develop a more biologically plausible approach inspired by the visuomotor pathway.

Method: The framework processes asynchronous events from stereo spike cameras (similar to retinas) and uses a recurrent spiking neural network to iteratively refine grasp hypotheses directly from spike streams, avoiding point cloud reconstruction.

Result: SpikeGrasp outperforms traditional point-cloud-based methods, especially in cluttered and textureless scenes, and shows remarkable data efficiency on a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The approach establishes the viability of end-to-end neuro-inspired grasping systems, paving the way for more fluid and efficient robotic manipulation similar to biological systems, particularly for dynamic objects.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

*Subhransu S. Bhattacharjee,Hao Lu,Dylan Campbell,Rahul Shome*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sampling-based pipeline using pretrained generative models to create probabilistic priors for robotic planning under partial observability, recovering complete RGB-D point clouds with occupancy and target semantics from partial observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Priors are essential for planning under partial observability but difficult to obtain in practice, requiring methods to capture environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships.

Method: Zero-shot pipeline leveraging large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors, conditioned on partial observations to recover complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics for configuration-space planning.

Result: The approach recovers commonsense spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D point clouds usable in motion planning, as demonstrated on a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways.

Conclusion: Generative models show promise as a rich source of priors for robotic planning, effectively representing both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in unobserved regions.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

TL;DR: SCOOP'D is a method that uses simulation to collect scooping demonstrations and generative policies via diffusion to imitate them, enabling zero-shot deployment in diverse real-world scooping scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic scooping is challenging due to complex tool-object interactions and deformable object manipulation, with applications in assistive feeding and disaster site retrieval.

Method: Uses OmniGibson simulation to collect demonstrations with privileged state information, then trains generative diffusion policies to imitate from observational input.

Result: Achieved promising results in 465 real-world trials across diverse scenarios, outperforming all baselines and ablations in zero-shot deployment.

Conclusion: SCOOP'D is a promising approach for acquiring robotic scooping skills that generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GLVC is a generative latent video compression framework that uses a pretrained tokenizer to project frames into a perceptually aligned latent space, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality with stable temporal coherence at nearly half the rate of existing neural codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing rate-distortion-perception tradeoff is challenging in video compression, with perceptually optimized neural video codecs often suffering from flickering artifacts due to frame-wise quality fluctuations.

Method: Uses a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into perceptually aligned latent space, redesigns codec architecture for latent domain with unified intra/inter coding and recurrent memory mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in DISTS and LPIPS metrics across multiple benchmarks, rivals latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while maintaining stable temporal coherence.

Conclusion: GLVC marks a step toward practical perceptual video compression by effectively addressing temporal coherence issues while achieving superior perceptual quality at lower bitrates.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural
compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains
challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression,
where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural
video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by
the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video
Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression.
GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a
perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints
from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture
explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior
neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified
intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results
across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance
in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC
rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while
maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical
perceptual video compression.

*Shanzhi Yin,Bolin Chen,Xinju Wu,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Shiqi Wang,Yan Ye*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Efficient 3D avatar coding framework using canonical Gaussian avatars and compact human priors for ultra-low bit rate compression, outperforming existing codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates for meta-verse applications by minimizing redundancy through decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution.

Method: Trains canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting, captures temporal movements via human-prior template with 94 parameters per frame, and generates target avatars through Linear Blend Skinning transformation.

Result: Significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression methods in rate-distortion performance on multi-view human video datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient compression with temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis, paving the way for immersive meta-verse experiences.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages
compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable
high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The
framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated
splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar
appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to
capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations.
This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy,
enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the
sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters,
consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal
bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming
canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating
temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting
compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream
multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive
multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.

Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique
for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However,
existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks
standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source
FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters.
Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for
a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression
efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and
encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally
lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is
merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a

comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types.
In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic

*Zhigang Cheng,Mingchao Sun,Yu Liu,Zengye Ge,Luyang Tang,Mu Xu,Yangyan Li,Peng Pan*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CLoD-GS introduces continuous level of detail for 3D Gaussian Splatting, eliminating storage overhead and popping artifacts of discrete methods through learnable distance-dependent opacity decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discrete LoD requires multiple model copies causing storage issues and visual popping artifacts during transitions, degrading user experience.

Method: Integrates continuous LoD into 3DGS using learnable distance-dependent decay parameters for each Gaussian primitive, with virtual distance scaling and coarse-to-fine training strategy with point count regularization.

Result: Achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from single model, reduces primitive count and memory footprint while maintaining high fidelity across performance targets.

Conclusion: CLoD-GS provides superior alternative to discrete LoD by enabling continuous detail scaling within unified model, eliminating storage and visual artifact problems.

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

*Shelly Golan,Yotam Nitzan,Zongze Wu,Or Patashnik*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A training-free method using vision-language models to adaptively steer diffusion models away from conventional concepts during generation, enabling creative image synthesis without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with genuine creativity and novel content generation, while existing creative generation methods are limited by predefined categories or require computationally intensive procedures.

Method: VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting uses a vision-language model to analyze intermediate generation outputs and adaptively steer the process away from conventional visual concepts, promoting novel outputs without training.

Result: The method achieves consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead, extends to complex scenarios like coherent object sets, and preserves creativity in compositional prompts.

Conclusion: This training-free approach integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines, offering a practical solution for generating creative outputs that go beyond textual description constraints.

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

TL;DR: A geometric framework models LLM reasoning as smooth flows in representation space, with logical statements controlling flow velocities, enabling formal analysis of reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs "think" through their representation space and disentangle logical structure from surface semantics.

Method: Proposes a geometric framework modeling reasoning as embedding trajectories, using natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers to test logic internalization beyond surface form.

Result: Establishes that LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space and logical statements act as local controllers of flow velocities.

Conclusion: Provides both conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomena, offering new interpretability and formal analysis methods for LLM behavior.

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic biases in emotional intelligence where identical scenarios with different user profiles produce divergent emotional interpretations, with advantaged profiles receiving more accurate interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how user memory in personalized AI systems affects emotional reasoning and whether it reinforces social inequalities.

Method: Evaluated 15 LLMs on human-validated emotional intelligence tests using identical scenarios paired with different user profiles across diverse demographics.

Result: Systematic biases emerged where advantaged profiles received more accurate emotional interpretations, with significant disparities in emotion understanding and supportive recommendations across demographic factors.

Conclusion: Personalization mechanisms in memory-enhanced AI can inadvertently embed social hierarchies into emotional reasoning, potentially reinforcing social inequalities.

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM performance on indirect/unseen issues by systematically integrating and extending existing approaches of method-based reasoning and scope extension into a more robust framework.

Method: Developed an Intuition-Method Layered Model where intuition provides rapid answers and method-based thinking creates transferable reasoning units, combined with scope extension across vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel/generalized), temporal, and spatial dimensions organized into knowledge trees/networks.

Result: Created a unified framework that logically connects existing approaches with new extensions and introduces an entropy-based evaluation metric to measure the system's capacity for solving unseen questions.

Conclusion: This work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs in real-world problem-solving by systematically organizing reasoning approaches and providing quantitative evaluation methods.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

*Meiru Zhang,Philipp Borchert,Milan Gritta,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRIFT is a framework that improves mathematical autoformalization by decomposing informal statements into sub-components for better premise retrieval from libraries like Mathlib.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with formalizing math statements due to limited context in informal statements and difficulty identifying prerequisite mathematical knowledge for theorem proving.

Method: DRIFT decomposes informal mathematical statements into smaller sub-components to enable targeted retrieval of premises from math libraries, and retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises effectively.

Result: DRIFT nearly doubles F1 score compared to DPR baseline on ProofNet, shows strong out-of-distribution performance on ConNF with 37.14% and 42.25% BEq+@10 improvements using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1 respectively.

Conclusion: Retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends on model-specific knowledge boundaries, requiring adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

TL;DR: Model interpolation (simple weight averaging) surprisingly outperforms complex model merging methods in reasoning tasks, following a three-stage evolutionary pattern that guides performance-cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study the simplest model merging method (weight interpolation) and understand its dynamics for efficient reasoning, as current approaches often overlook this basic technique despite its potential.

Method: Systematic investigation of direct weight interpolation between models, analyzing its three-stage evolutionary behavior on reasoning trajectories, with ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.

Result: Strategically interpolated models surpass sophisticated model merging baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness, with empirical validation showing the method's superiority.

Conclusion: Model interpolation is demystified as an effective approach for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities, offering a practical framework for performance-cost optimization.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

### [399] [$How^{2}$: How to learn from procedural How-to questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11144)
*Gautier Dagan,Frank Keller,Alex Lascarides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: How2 is a memory agent framework that enables AI agents to ask how-to questions, store answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments like Minecraft.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: How-to questions help agents reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps for planning, but their open-ended nature makes them challenging for AI agents to ask and for AI experts to answer efficiently.

Method: Introduces How2 framework with memory agents that ask how-to questions, store answers, and reuse them. Evaluated in Plancraft (Minecraft crafting environment) using teacher models that provide answers at varying abstraction levels.

Result: Lifelong learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled from the current state. Abstract subgoal descriptions outperform executable action sequences.

Conclusion: How2 enables LLM-based agents to improve planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive environments, with abstracted answers being most effective for lifelong learning.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

*Jiale Guo,Suizhi Huang,Mei Li,Dong Huang,Xingsheng Chen,Regina Zhang,Zhijiang Guo,Han Yu,Siu-Ming Yiu,Christian Jensen,Pietro Lio,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This survey provides the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering, bridging evaluation and solution approaches through a comprehensive taxonomy of 150+ papers spanning solution paradigms and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect in LLM-empowered software engineering, hindering systematic progress and evaluation despite the paradigm shift from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems.

Method: Analyzed 150+ recent papers and organized them into a taxonomy spanning two dimensions: (1) Solutions (prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, agent-based paradigms) and (2) Benchmarks (code generation, translation, repair, etc.). Created a unified pipeline showing workflow from task specification to deliverables.

Result: Revealed evolution from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems with planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. Provided full-spectrum coverage connecting 50+ benchmarks with solution strategies, enabling optimal approach identification for specific evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: Identified critical research gaps and proposed future directions including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving code generation, and formal verification integration. Serves as foundational resource for understanding and advancing LLM-empowered software engineering systems.

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems
capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field
lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions
interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey
presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,
bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We
analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy
spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,
fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code
generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the
field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems
incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory
mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that
illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final
deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying
complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys
that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting
50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling
researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future
directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code
generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based
methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and
practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered
software engineering systems.

### [401] [Operationalizing AI: Empirical Evidence on MLOps Practices, User Satisfaction, and Organizational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09968)
*Stefan Pasch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Analysis of 8,000+ user reviews shows that 7 out of 9 MLOps practices significantly improve user satisfaction in AI development platforms, with benefits being universal across organizations regardless of size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited empirical evidence exists on whether MLOps practices actually support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications, despite the emergence of MLOps as a solution to challenges in AI implementation.

Method: Analyzed over 8,000 user reviews from G2.com using zero-shot classification to measure sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices including CI/CD, workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, and monitoring.

Result: Seven of the nine MLOps practices show significant positive relationship with user satisfaction. Small firms discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, but firm size does not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction relationship.

Conclusion: Effective MLOps implementation provides tangible value to AI development, and once applied, MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across different organizational settings.

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence
(AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability,
maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that
integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing
the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices
support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains
limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI
development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure
review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous
integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility,
versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a
significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that
effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development.
However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms
discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational
context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does
not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied,
MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational
settings.

### [402] [Comparative Evaluation of Neural Network Architectures for Generalizable Human Spatial Preference Prediction in Unseen Built Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10954)
*Maral Doctorarastoo,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés,Christopher McComb*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: Comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and feedforward Neural Networks for predicting human spatial preferences in unseen built environments using synthetic pocket park data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalizing preference models to environmental configurations not seen during training, which is crucial for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS).

Method: Used synthetic data from simplified pocket park environments to compare three neural network architectures (GNNs, CNNs, feedforward NNs) on their ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios.

Result: Models were evaluated based on prediction accuracy for preferences influenced by physical, environmental, and social features, using generalizability scores calculated via area under precision-recall curve for seen vs unseen layouts.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into which neural network architectures are most suitable for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments, with generalizability scores appropriate for imbalanced data.

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments
is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems
(CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of
preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within
environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep
learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual
dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most
effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a
comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and
standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a
simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this
illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability
to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models
are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by
heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability
score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the
seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for
imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network
architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built
environments.

### [403] [Group-Adaptive Adversarial Learning for Robust Fake News Detection Against Malicious Comments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09712)
*Zhao Tong,Chunlin Gong,Yimeng Gu,Haichao Shi,Qiang Liu,Shu Wu,Xiao-Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of fake news detection models to adversarial comments and proposes a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve robustness while maintaining detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news detection models are vulnerable to adversarial comments from real users or LLMs that can subtly shift model decisions, undermining trust in social media platforms.

Method: The approach involves: (1) categorizing adversarial comments into perceptual, cognitive, and societal types; (2) generating diverse category-specific attacks using LLMs; (3) using a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism to dynamically adjust learning focus across comment categories during training.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing robustness to various adversarial comment perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed group-adaptive adversarial training strategy effectively enhances the robustness of fake news detection models against adversarial comment attacks.

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

*Gregory D. Baker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Narrative Learning is a method where models are defined in natural language and refine classification criteria using explanatory prompts instead of numerical optimization, showing improved accuracy over baseline explainable models on most datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative approach to machine learning where models are entirely defined in natural language and iteratively refined through explanatory prompts, moving away from traditional numerical optimization methods.

Method: Models are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their classification criteria using explanatory prompts. The approach was evaluated on 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compared against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models.

Result: On 5 out of 6 datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate than baseline explainable models by 2025 or earlier due to improvements in language models. Lexicostatistical analysis was used to assess explanation comprehensibility.

Conclusion: Narrative Learning demonstrates the potential of natural language-based model definition and refinement, showing competitive accuracy with traditional explainable models while offering a different approach to machine learning through language-based optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

*Ayoub Bouguettaya,Elizabeth M. Stuart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning was used to create a bottom-up personality model from adjectives, but it failed to match the descriptive power and interpretability of the established Big Five model when analyzing Reddit comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether machine learning can create a better personality model than the established Big Five framework by building a bottom-up model from adjective lists.

Method: Created a machine learning-based personality model from classic adjective lists and compared it against the Big Five model by analyzing one million Reddit comments.

Result: The Big Five model (especially Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism) provided much more powerful and interpretable descriptions of online communities. The machine learning clusters failed to create meaningful distinctions, missed the Extraversion trait, and lacked psychometric coherence.

Conclusion: The Big Five model remains robust and superior. Machine learning can help validate established psychological theories but cannot replace them, as personality's semantic structure appears context-dependent.

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pre-execution safety framework for LLM agents that addresses data, model, and evaluation gaps through AuraGen for data synthesis, Safiron as a guardian model, and Pre-Exec Bench for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale and provides limited control over plan-level supervision, creating safety risks before action execution.

Method: Proposes AuraGen for controllable data synthesis with risk injection, Safiron as a cross-planner guardian model with two-stage training, and Pre-Exec Bench for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent gains over baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, with robust transfer across settings and actionable practices distilled from ablations.

Conclusion: Provides a practical template for safer agentic systems by addressing pre-execution safety through a comprehensive framework covering data synthesis, guardian models, and realistic evaluation.

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

### [407] [Translution: Unifying Self-attention and Convolution for Adaptive and Relative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10060)
*Hehe Fan,Yi Yang,Mohan Kankanhalli,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Translution is a new operation that combines self-attention's adaptive element identification with convolution's relative encoding, with a lightweight variant called α-Translution to address computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of self-attention (dependency on absolute positional embedding) and convolution (fixed kernel size limiting adaptive element selection) by creating a unified operation that leverages both approaches.

Method: Proposed Translution operation that integrates adaptive identification capability from self-attention and relative encoding advantage from convolution, with α-Translution as a lightweight variant to handle parameter explosion.

Result: Experiments on computer vision and NLP tasks show Translution (including α-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention.

Conclusion: Translution successfully unifies the strengths of self-attention and convolution, providing a more effective approach for modeling data with both adaptive element identification and relative encoding capabilities.

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

*Jinghao Zhang,Naishan Zheng,Ruilin Li,Dongzhou Cheng,Zheming Liang,Feng Zhao,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLFR proposes using flow rewards from latent space for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, addressing limitations of binary verification and expensive process reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary verification in RLVR overlooks valuable reasoning exploration, and golden Process Reward Models are annotation-heavy. Existing auxiliary signals from logit space (entropy/likelihood) have limitations.

Method: Construct flow fields from off-policy high-quality data or on-policy rejection sampling data, then quantify velocity deviations of policy latents within these flow fields as reward signals.

Result: Experiments on language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, showing that well-established flow fields can serve as effective environments for reward collection.

Conclusion: RLFR presents a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals, leveraging the underexplored expressive latent space and efficiently compressing context dependence from expert data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

*Michael Y. Hu,Benjamin Van Durme,Jacob Andreas,Harsh Jhamtani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECHO is a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay for language model agents, generating optimized trajectories from failed attempts to improve sample efficiency in novel environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model agents deployed in novel environments exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions, which hinders their usefulness in costly interaction scenarios like human interaction or physical system resets.

Method: ECHO consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. It generates synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions.

Result: ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80% across XMiniGrid and PeopleJoinQA domains. In XMiniGrid, it also outperforms sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments.

Conclusion: ECHO enables more effective utilization of past experiences through hindsight optimization, significantly improving language model agents' sample efficiency and adaptation capabilities in novel environments.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

TL;DR: PerSyn is a personalized data synthesis method that routes prompts to optimal teachers for each student model, improving knowledge distillation by matching teacher outputs with student learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stronger teacher models are not always optimal for student learning due to mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability, creating a need for personalized synthesis strategies.

Method: Uses a "Route then Generate" paradigm with a query-level router that assigns prompts to optimal teachers based on student learnability and teacher response quality, then teachers synthesize data only for assigned prompts.

Result: PerSyn consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in instruct tuning and math reasoning settings across different model families and scales.

Conclusion: The proposed personalized synthesis approach effectively addresses the teacher-student mismatch problem and offers insights for future research in knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

*Xiaoyun Zhang,Xiaojian Yuan,Di Huang,Wang You,Chen Hu,Jingqing Ruan,Kejiang Chen,Xing Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER) to address policy entropy collapse in RLVR training for LLMs, dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation to improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training suffers from policy entropy collapse where policies become overly deterministic, limiting reasoning performance. Standard entropy regularization is unstable due to fixed coefficients that don't adapt to task difficulty.

Method: AER framework with three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment to maintain policy entropy within a moderate range.

Result: Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Conclusion: Adaptive entropy regularization effectively addresses entropy collapse in RLVR, demonstrating that properly balanced exploration-exploitation significantly enhances LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELMO is a pure low-precision training framework for Extreme Multilabel Classification (XMC) that uses BFloat16 and Float8 data types, enabling significant GPU memory reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XMC methods rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training which is unstable, inefficient in memory usage and computational overhead. Existing low-precision methods still retain higher precision for classification layers.

Method: Proposes ELMO framework using BFloat16 and Float8 data types with Kahan summation and stochastic rounding. Implements memory optimizations including gradient fusion and chunking to enable pure Float8 training without single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.

Result: Achieved significant memory reduction - trained a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB GPU memory compared to 39.7 GiB required by state-of-the-art method Renee, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8 using the proposed ELMO framework, enabling substantial memory savings while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of

*Daniel Scalena,Leonidas Zotos,Elisabetta Fersini,Malvina Nissim,Ahmet Üstün*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGer is a training-free generation method that uses token-wise entropy to dynamically allocate compute budget, reducing redundant computation while improving performance on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models use the same compute budget for all prompts, but different prompts have different complexity levels and computation needs. This leads to inefficient resource allocation.

Method: EAGer leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution to branch to multiple reasoning paths only when high-entropy tokens are present, and reallocates saved compute budget to instances where alternative path exploration is most needed.

Result: Across multiple models on AIME 2025 benchmark, EAGer achieves best efficiency-performance trade-off. When labels are accessible, it generates 65% fewer tokens (saving compute) and achieves 37% improvement in Pass@k compared to Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: EAGer effectively reduces redundant computation while improving reasoning performance by dynamically allocating compute budget based on prompt complexity through entropy analysis.

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

TL;DR: RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains, enabling great performance and token efficiency through a proposed Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generalization of tool-augmented reinforcement learning across diverse domains remains underexplored, despite advances in LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposed Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning (TGRL) framework with: standardized tool interface, dual-component reward system, and XML-based prompt template to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill migration.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective cross-domain transfer of RL-based tool usage from mathematical tasks to other domains.

Conclusion: The work highlights the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning, showing that tool usage skills can generalize effectively across different reasoning domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENIGMA is a novel LLM training approach that improves reasoning, alignment, and robustness by treating organizational policies as directions on the model's information manifold, combining GRPO, SAMI-style InfoNCE, and entropic regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To jointly improve reasoning, alignment, and robustness in LLMs by treating policies as geometric directions on the information manifold, creating a unified approach without needing reward models.

Method: Single-loop trainer combining Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with CoT-format rewards, Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI) symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary, and entropic Sinkhorn optimal-transport regularization on hidden states.

Result: Experiments with 1B LLMs show high-SI principles predict steadier training and improved benchmark performance over GRPO ablations, with information-geometry analysis validating desirable structural changes in the manifold.

Conclusion: Reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a single information-geometric objective, and ENIGMA enables principled reasoning without reward models, offering a path to trusted capability.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLook is an agentic reinforcement learning framework that uses multimodal LLMs to improve front-end code generation by creating a generate-diagnose-refine loop with visual feedback from screenshots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with front-end development where correctness depends on rendered pixels and interaction, not just algorithmic correctness.

Method: Uses MLLM as visual critic to score code with screenshots and provide vision-grounded feedback. Implements Forced Optimization to ensure only improving revisions are accepted, preventing behavioral collapse.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across three benchmarks in vision-grounded front-end code generation while maintaining comparable latency to base decoding.

Conclusion: Demonstrates benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling for front-end code generation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

### [417] [Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683)
*Nianyi Lin,Jiajie Zhang,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BGPO is a memory-efficient RL algorithm for diffusion LLMs that uses a specially constructed lower bound to enable large Monte Carlo sample sizes without memory constraints, improving performance on math, code, and planning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for diffusion LLMs suffer from high memory overhead due to needing to retain forward computational graphs for all Monte Carlo samples during gradient computation, limiting sample sizes and causing imprecise likelihood approximations.

Method: Proposes Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BGPO) which maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective that has linearity (enables gradient accumulation) and equivalence (matches value and gradient of original objective) properties.

Result: BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for diffusion LLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks by enabling larger MC sample sizes and more accurate likelihood approximations.

Conclusion: BGPO provides an effective memory-efficient solution for RL training of diffusion LLMs by addressing the memory bottleneck through a carefully designed lower bound that maintains training effectiveness while enabling larger sample sizes.

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

TL;DR: QeRL is a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework that combines NVFP4 quantization with LoRA to accelerate RL training for large language models while reducing memory usage, achieving 1.5x speedup and enabling RL training of 32B models on single GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities but is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these efficiency issues while also leveraging quantization noise to enhance exploration.

Method: Combines NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts noise during training to optimize exploration.

Result: Achieves over 1.5x speedup in rollout phase, enables RL training of 32B LLM on single H100 80GB GPU, faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, matches full-parameter fine-tuning performance on GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) benchmarks.

Conclusion: QeRL establishes itself as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs, addressing both computational efficiency and training effectiveness through quantization-enhanced methods.

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradFix enables efficient transfer of task vectors across different foundation model versions by leveraging gradient sign structure, requiring only a few labeled samples without additional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid repeating full fine-tuning when new foundation model versions are released, by enabling transfer of task vectors across different pre-trained models despite parameter space misalignment.

Method: Uses gradient sign structure of the new model to mask the source task vector, creating a locally aligned update through computing a few gradients at the target model without additional fine-tuning.

Result: Significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GradFix provides an efficient method for transferring task knowledge across model versions using gradient sign alignment, with theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD), which replaces isotropic noise with structured frequency-diagonal covariance to shape inductive biases in diffusion models, improving performance and enabling selective omission of corruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build explicit inductive biases into diffusion models to better accommodate target data distributions, as current DPMs have largely implicit biases.

Method: Introduces anisotropic noise operator with structured frequency-diagonal covariance that unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, keeping the forward process Gaussian while emphasizing/suppressing specific frequency bands.

Result: SAGD outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets and enables selective omission of known corruptions confined to specific frequency bands.

Conclusion: Anisotropic forward noise provides a principled way to tailor inductive bias in DPMs, demonstrating improved performance and selective corruption handling capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

TL;DR: SODA is a semantic cohesive knowledge distillation method for cross-modal hashing that uses multi-label information as a new textual modality and learns a well-mapped Hamming space to bridge the modality gap between images and text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods fail to explicitly interact multi-label semantic extraction with raw multimodal data, making learned semantic information incompatible with heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering modality gap bridging.

Method: Introduces multi-label information as a new textual modality formulated as ground-truth label prompts, uses a cross-modal teacher network to distill semantic characteristics between image and label modalities, and learns a Hamming space that guides a student network to preserve semantic similarities.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SODA method effectively bridges the modality gap by using semantic cohesive knowledge distillation and achieves superior performance in cross-modal hashing tasks.

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

*Atharv Goel,Sharat Agarwal,Saket Anand,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCAL-R is a reliable active learning framework that uses neural collapse geometry to select informative samples while mitigating the effects of noisy labels and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional active learning methods are unreliable when labels are noisy or data distribution shifts occur, as they often amplify errors by selecting mislabeled or redundant samples.

Method: Uses two geometric signals: Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score (measures structural impact on inter-class geometry) and Feature Fluctuation score (captures temporal representation instability across training checkpoints).

Result: Outperforms standard AL baselines on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labels, improved robustness under label noise, and better generalization to out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric reliability criteria makes active learning more robust to annotation errors and distribution shifts, enabling more trustworthy deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the relationship between decodability and causality in vision transformers, finding systematic mismatches where some tokens are causally influential but weakly decodable, while others are highly decodable but functionally inert.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle the often conflated notions of decodability (information recoverability) and causality (functional influence on outputs) in neural networks, specifically in vision transformers fine-tuned for object counting.

Method: Used activation patching to test causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs, and trained linear probes to assess decodability of count information at different depths.

Result: Found systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens have strong causal influence despite weak decodability, while final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding but are functionally inert. CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in final layers.

Conclusion: Decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation - what information is present versus what is used - and their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

TL;DR: Decomposer Networks (DecompNet) is a semantic autoencoder that factorizes inputs into multiple interpretable components using parallel branches with residual updates, enforcing competition among components for parsimonious representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create interpretable component decomposition beyond classical autoencoders' single latent representation, addressing limitations of existing linear methods and object-centric architectures.

Method: Uses N parallel branches with residual inputs (original signal minus other branches' reconstructions), unrolling Gauss-Seidel block-coordinate descent into differentiable network with all-but-one residual update rule.

Result: Produces parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations through explicit competition among components.

Conclusion: DecompNet introduces the first semantic autoencoder implementing all-but-one residual updates, offering novel interpretable decomposition capabilities.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INR-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark for multimodal Implicit Neural Representations, evaluating 78 model variants across 9 tasks to understand how architectures, positional encoding, and activation functions affect performance on signals of varying frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the factors influencing Implicit Neural Representations' effectiveness and limitations, particularly how model architectures, positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect response to signals of varying frequencies.

Method: Leveraged Neural Tangent Kernel theory for analysis, then created INR-Bench with 56 Coordinate-MLP variants (4 positional encodings × 14 activation functions) and 22 Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9 implicit multimodal tasks covering forward and inverse problems.

Result: Established a comprehensive benchmark platform that highlights the strengths and limitations of different neural models for Implicit Neural Representations.

Conclusion: INR-Bench provides a solid foundation for future research in Implicit Neural Representations by offering the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for multimodal INR tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal
processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution.
However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain
underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic
MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the
response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we
introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed
for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models
(featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22
Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9
implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems,
offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of
different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future
research. The code and dataset are available at

### [428] [ImpMIA: Leveraging Implicit Bias for Membership Inference Attack under Realistic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10625)
*Yuval Golbari,Navve Wasserman,Gal Vardi,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpMIA is a white-box membership inference attack that exploits neural network implicit bias using KKT conditions to identify training samples without needing reference models or unrealistic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box MIA methods rely on unrealistic assumptions about attacker knowledge and data distribution. Removing these assumptions significantly degrades their performance, creating need for more practical attacks.

Method: Uses implicit bias theory and KKT optimality conditions to find training samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model's parameters, eliminating need for reference models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black-box and white-box attacks in realistic settings where only model weights and a superset of training data are available.

Conclusion: ImpMIA demonstrates that exploiting implicit bias through KKT conditions provides an effective white-box MIA approach that works under practical constraints without relying on unrealistic assumptions.

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

### [429] [Optimally Deep Networks -- Adapting Model Depth to Datasets for Superior Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10764)
*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ODNs optimize neural network depth to match dataset complexity, reducing computational costs and memory usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often have excessive capacity for simple datasets, leading to wasted computation, energy consumption, and memory usage that hinders deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Progressive depth expansion training strategy that starts with shallow networks and incrementally increases depth as earlier blocks converge, removing redundant layers to find optimal depth.

Result: ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 achieved 98.64% and 96.44% memory footprint reduction on MNIST and SVHN datasets while maintaining 99.31% and 96.08% accuracy respectively.

Conclusion: ODNs provide an effective approach to balance model depth with task complexity, significantly reducing computational and memory costs while preserving competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

### [430] [On the Optimal Representation Efficiency of Barlow Twins: An Information-Geometric Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10980)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency in self-supervised learning, proving that Barlow Twins achieves optimal efficiency by making the cross-correlation matrix identity and inducing isotropic Fisher Information Matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no unified theoretical framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different self-supervised learning paradigms, despite SSL's remarkable success in learning meaningful representations without labeled data.

Method: The authors define representation efficiency as the ratio between effective intrinsic dimension (derived from Fisher Information Matrix spectral properties) and ambient dimension. They analyze Barlow Twins method theoretically under natural assumptions.

Result: The paper proves that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency (η = 1) by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards identity matrix, which induces an isotropic Fisher Information Matrix.

Conclusion: This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding Barlow Twins' effectiveness and offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

### [431] [The Easy Path to Robustness: Coreset Selection using Sample Hardness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11018)
*Pranav Ramesh,Arjun Roy,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy,Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EasyCore is a coreset selection method that identifies easy samples with low adversarial vulnerability using Average Input Gradient Norm (AIGN) to improve adversarial robustness in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coreset selection methods focus on clean accuracy but fail to preserve adversarial robustness, creating a need for data-centric approaches that understand which samples are crucial for learning resilient features.

Method: Proposed EasyCore framework links sample adversarial vulnerability to hardness quantified by AIGN, then selects only samples with low AIGN (easy samples) that are less vulnerable and further from decision boundaries.

Result: Models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher adversarial accuracy than competing coreset methods, with up to 7% improvement under standard training and 5% under TRADES adversarial training.

Conclusion: AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset property, making EasyCore an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method for improving adversarial robustness across different training paradigms.

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

### [432] [Lightweight Facial Landmark Detection in Thermal Images via Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11128)
*Qiyi Tong,Olivia Nocentini,Marta Lagomarsino,Kuanqi Cai,Marta Lorenzini,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MLCM-KD framework with DIKD for efficient thermal facial landmark detection by bidirectional knowledge distillation between RGB and thermal modalities to overcome modality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal FLD is crucial for low-light applications but lacks visual cues. Existing cross-modal methods are computationally expensive or create artifacts, limiting practical use.

Method: Multi-level cross-modal knowledge distillation with dual-injected KD (DIKD) - bidirectional mechanism that guides thermal student with RGB features and validates learned representations through closed-loop supervision.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on thermal FLD benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: MLCM-KD with DIKD enables robust and efficient thermal FLD by overcoming modality gap through bidirectional knowledge transfer, achieving superior performance with reduced computation.

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

### [433] [Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference Between Features in Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11709)
*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial vulnerability in neural networks stems from superposition (representing more features than dimensions), where adversarial perturbations exploit interference between superposed features, making attacks predictable from feature arrangements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental causes of adversarial examples in neural networks, moving beyond views of them as artifacts of decision landscape irregularities or sensitivity to non-robust features.

Method: Analyzed how superposition creates arrangements of latent representations that adversaries exploit, using synthetic settings with controlled superposition and testing on a ViT trained on CIFAR-10.

Result: Showed that superposition suffices to create adversarial vulnerability, with adversarial perturbations leveraging interference between superposed features, explaining attack transferability and class-specific vulnerability patterns.

Conclusion: Adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct of networks' representational compression through superposition, rather than flaws in learning processes or non-robust inputs.

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: VCB Bench is a Chinese benchmark for evaluating large audio language models using real human speech across instruction following, knowledge understanding, and robustness dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited by being English-centric, relying on synthetic speech, and lacking comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation.

Method: Built a high-quality Chinese benchmark entirely on real human speech, evaluating LALMs from three perspectives: instruction following, knowledge understanding, and robustness to various perturbations.

Result: Experiments on representative LALMs revealed notable performance gaps and identified areas for future improvement.

Conclusion: VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained evaluation framework with standardized methodology for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have greatly enhanced
multimodal conversational systems. However, existing benchmarks remain limited
-- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack
comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address
these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality
Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates
LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including
speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general
knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under
perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on
representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future
directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained
evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights
for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Diffusion-Link bridges audio-text modality gap using diffusion models, improving audio captioning performance by mapping audio embeddings to text distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent audio-text modality gap that limits the benefits of coupling multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs).

Method: A diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution, implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks.

Result: Reduces modality gap the most among prior methods, achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot (52.5% relative gain) and fully supervised captioning (7.5% relative gain) without external knowledge.

Conclusion: Closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations,
yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling
multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present
Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively
maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is
trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and
implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess
the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on
Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first
application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results.
(1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link
reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows
a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2)
Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline
achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised
captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and
7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is
pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and
diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond
knowledge-retrieval-centric designs. Code will be released upon acceptance

*Jianghao Lin,Rong Shan,Jiachen Zhu,Yunjia Xi,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI-generated survey papers are flooding research communities, creating a "survey paper DDoS attack" that threatens scientific integrity through redundant, low-quality content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of AI-generated surveys using LLMs has transformed traditionally labor-intensive survey writing into low-effort, high-volume output, threatening to overwhelm researchers and erode trust in scientific literature.

Method: The authors propose instituting strong norms for AI-assisted review writing, restoring expert oversight and transparency, and developing new infrastructures like Dynamic Live Surveys - community-maintained, version-controlled repositories that blend automated updates with human curation.

Result: Through quantitative trend analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, the paper demonstrates that unchecked AI-generated surveys are flooding preprint platforms and overwhelming the research community.

Conclusion: Safeguarding the integrity of survey papers is imperative, requiring immediate action to stop the "survey paper DDoS attack" through expert oversight, transparency in AI usage, and new infrastructure development.

Abstract: Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research
communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts
across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys,
especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this
traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output.
While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical
threat: the phenomenon we term the "survey paper DDoS attack" to the research
community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially
comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey
manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and
erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we
must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey
paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for
AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and
transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as
Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories
that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend
analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that
safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to
the research community.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: CrowdNotes+ is an LLM-augmented framework that improves Community Notes' speed and reliability for health misinformation governance, reducing the 17.6-hour median delay through evidence-grounded note augmentation and utility-guided automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Community Notes system has significant latency (17.6 hours median delay) in flagging health misinformation, which is inadequate during real-time misinformation surges.

Method: Proposes CrowdNotes+ with two modes: evidence-grounded note augmentation and utility-guided note automation, plus hierarchical three-step evaluation (relevance, correctness, helpfulness). Uses HealthNotes benchmark with 1.2K annotated health notes and fine-tuned helpfulness judge.

Result: Experiments on 15 LLMs reveal current helpfulness evaluation mistakes stylistic fluency for factual accuracy. Hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented generation jointly improve factual precision and evidence utility.

Conclusion: Hybrid human-AI governance model can improve both rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking for health misinformation.

Abstract: Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X
(formerly Twitter), enables users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual
notes, and vote on their helpfulness. However, our analysis of 30.8K
health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6
hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve
responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+,
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance.
CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note
augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical
three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and
helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of
1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness
judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current
helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual
accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented
generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These
results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the
rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.

*Guan-Yan Yang,Tzu-Yu Cheng,Ya-Wen Teng,Farn Wanga,Kuo-Hui Yeh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ArtPerception is a black-box jailbreak framework that uses ASCII art to bypass LLM security measures through a systematic two-phase approach, achieving high success rates across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety alignments focus on semantic interpretation but are vulnerable to attacks using non-standard data representations like ASCII art.

Method: Two-phase methodology: Phase 1 conducts model-specific pre-testing to determine optimal ASCII art recognition parameters; Phase 2 uses these insights for efficient one-shot jailbreak attacks. Uses Modified Levenshtein Distance for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrated superior jailbreak performance on four SOTA open-source LLMs and successful transferability to commercial models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-V3). Effectively bypassed defenses like LLaMA Guard and Azure content filters.

Conclusion: LLM security must defend against multi-modal interpretation spaces even in text-only inputs, and reconnaissance-based attacks are highly effective against current safety measures.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

*Tianze Wang,Zhaoyu Chen,Jian Du,Yingtai Xiao,Linjun Zhang,Qiang Yan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecPE is a novel differentially private synthetic text generation framework that provides secret-aware protection, achieving better utility-privacy trade-offs and reduced computational complexity compared to uniform DP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP synthetic text generation methods impose uniform privacy guarantees that overprotect non-sensitive content, causing substantial utility loss and computational overhead.

Method: Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE) extends private evolution with secret-aware protection, providing (p,r)-secret protection as a relaxation of Gaussian DP.

Result: Across OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE achieves lower FID and higher downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines while requiring less noise for the same protection level.

Conclusion: Secret-aware guarantees enable more practical and effective privacy-preserving synthetic text generation with tighter utility-privacy trade-offs.

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

TL;DR: Reasoning-based safety guardrails in Large Reasoning Models are vulnerable to simple prompt manipulations, allowing jailbreak attacks with high success rates despite appearing strong initially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the fragility of reasoning-based safety guardrails in LRMs that show strong defense against jailbreaks but can be easily bypassed through subtle prompt manipulations.

Method: Introduced various jailbreak methods including template token additions and automated optimization attacks across white-, gray-, and black-box settings to subvert reasoning-based guardrails.

Result: Achieved alarmingly high attack success rates (exceeding 90% across 5 benchmarks on gpt-oss series) and confirmed systemic vulnerabilities across various open-source LRMs.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse, as current reasoning-based guardrails are systematically vulnerable.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is

### [442] [SecureWebArena: A Holistic Security Evaluation Benchmark for LVLM-based Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10073)
*Zonghao Ying,Yangguang Shao,Jianle Gan,Gan Xu,Junjie Shen,Wenxin Zhang,Quanchen Zou,Junzheng Shi,Zhenfei Yin,Mingchuan Zhang,Aishan Liu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: \tool{} is the first holistic benchmark for evaluating security of LVLM-based web agents, featuring 6 simulated web environments, 2,970 trajectories, and a taxonomy of 6 attack vectors with multi-layered evaluation across reasoning, behavior, and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing security benchmarks for LVLM-based web agents provide only partial coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios like user-level prompt manipulation, failing to capture the broad range of agent vulnerabilities in real-world deployment.

Method: \tool{} introduces a unified evaluation suite with 6 simulated web environments and 2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. It defines a structured taxonomy of 6 attack vectors (user-level and environment-level) and uses multi-layered evaluation across internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task outcome.

Result: Large-scale experiments on 9 representative LVLMs (general-purpose, agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded) show all tested agents are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations, revealing critical trade-offs between model specialization and security.

Conclusion: \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing trustworthy web agent deployment by providing a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and multi-layered evaluation pipeline, plus empirical insights into security challenges of modern LVLM-based web agents.

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

*Felix Duelmer,Mohammad Farid Azampour,Nassir Navab*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: UltraScatter is a probabilistic ray tracing framework that efficiently models ultrasound scattering using volumetric scattering fields and delta tracking, producing B-mode images in seconds instead of minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods are computationally expensive, while faster convolution-based approaches remain slow for full B-mode image generation.

Method: Probabilistic ray tracing with volumetric scattering probability fields, free-flight delta tracking for ray interactions, and linear time-of-flight model for phase information, integrated with plane-wave imaging and beamforming.

Result: Generates B-mode images within seconds with realistic speckle and inclusion patterns, validated with phantom data.

Conclusion: UltraScatter provides a scalable alternative to wave-based ultrasound simulation methods with significantly faster computation times.

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods solve wave equations numerically,
achieving high accuracy but at substantial computational cost. Faster
alternatives based on convolution with precomputed impulse responses remain
relatively slow, often requiring several minutes to generate a full B-mode
image. We introduce UltraScatter, a probabilistic ray tracing framework that
models ultrasound scattering efficiently and realistically. Tissue is
represented as a volumetric field of scattering probability and scattering
amplitude, and ray interactions are simulated via free-flight delta tracking.
Scattered rays are traced to the transducer, with phase information
incorporated through a linear time-of-flight model. Integrated with plane-wave
imaging and beamforming, our parallelized ray tracing architecture produces
B-mode images within seconds. Validation with phantom data shows realistic
speckle and inclusion patterns, positioning UltraScatter as a scalable
alternative to wave-based methods.

### [444] [CardRewriter: Leveraging Knowledge Cards for Long-Tail Query Rewriting on Short-Video Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10095)
*Peiyuan Gong,Feiran Zhu,Yaqi Yin,Chenglei Dai,Chao Zhang,Kai Zheng,Wentian Bao,Jiaxin Mao,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CardRewriter is an LLM-based framework that enhances long-tail query rewriting on short-video platforms by incorporating domain-specific knowledge through query-relevant knowledge cards, improving retrieval effectiveness for proprietary content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User queries on short-video platforms often contain spelling errors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, leading to mismatches between user expectations and retrieved results. LLMs struggle with proprietary content like short videos, live streams, and social networks that fall outside their training distribution.

Method: The framework aggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to each query and summarizes it into informative knowledge cards. These cards guide the LLM to better capture user intent. Training uses a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization with a tailored reward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness.

Result: Offline experiments show substantial improvement in rewriting quality for queries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing confirms significant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), with notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR).

Conclusion: CardRewriter has been successfully deployed on Kuaishou since September 2025, serving hundreds of millions of users daily, demonstrating effective enhancement of long-tail query rewriting on short-video platforms.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have rapidly become a new generation of information
retrieval systems, where users formulate queries to access desired videos.
However, user queries, especially long-tail ones, often suffer from spelling
errors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, resulting in mismatches
between user expectations and retrieved results. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown success in long-tail query rewriting within e-commerce, they
struggle on short-video platforms, where proprietary content such as short
videos, live streams, micro dramas, and user social networks falls outside
their training distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce
\textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific
knowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method
aggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into
an informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM
to better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We
optimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored
reward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline
experiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for
queries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing further confirms
significant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), along
with a notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR). Since
September 2025, CardRewriter has been deployed on Kuaishou, one of China's
largest short-video platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

*Shubham Chatterjee,Jeff Dalton*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: QDER is a neural re-ranking model that unifies entity-oriented and multi-vector approaches by integrating knowledge graph semantics with fine-grained token representations using late aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between entity-oriented approaches using knowledge graphs and multi-vector models capturing fine-grained semantics in neural information retrieval.

Method: Maintains individual token and entity representations throughout ranking, performs aggregation only at final scoring (late aggregation), transforms representations through learned attention patterns, and applies precise mathematical operations for matching.

Result: Achieves 36% improvement in nDCG@20 over strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004, with similar gains on other datasets. Particularly excels on difficult queries, achieving nDCG@20 of 0.70 where traditional approaches fail completely.

Conclusion: QDER successfully unifies entity-aware and multi-vector approaches, setting a foundation for future work in entity-aware retrieval with significant performance improvements, especially on challenging queries.

Abstract: Neural IR has advanced through two distinct paths: entity-oriented approaches
leveraging knowledge graphs and multi-vector models capturing fine-grained
semantics. We introduce QDER, a neural re-ranking model that unifies these
approaches by integrating knowledge graph semantics into a multi-vector model.
QDER's key innovation lies in its modeling of query-document relationships:
rather than computing similarity scores on aggregated embeddings, we maintain
individual token and entity representations throughout the ranking process,
performing aggregation only at the final scoring stage - an approach we call
"late aggregation." We first transform these fine-grained representations
through learned attention patterns, then apply carefully chosen mathematical
operations for precise matches. Experiments across five standard benchmarks
show that QDER achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of 36%
in nDCG@20 over the strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004 and similar
improvements on other datasets. QDER particularly excels on difficult queries,
achieving an nDCG@20 of 0.70 where traditional approaches fail completely
(nDCG@20 = 0.0), setting a foundation for future work in entity-aware
retrieval.

### [446] [REGENT: Relevance-Guided Attention for Entity-Aware Multi-Vector Neural Re-Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11592)
*Shubham Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: REGENT introduces a neural re-ranking model that uses entities as semantic anchors to guide attention, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic reasoning for improved document ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural re-rankers struggle with complex information needs and long documents due to rigid token windows that miss critical semantic signals and treat all interactions as equally important.

Method: REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into attention mechanism, using entities as a 'semantic skeleton' to focus on conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term matches.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna.

Conclusion: First work to successfully integrate entity semantics directly into neural attention, establishing a new paradigm for entity-aware information retrieval.

Abstract: Current neural re-rankers often struggle with complex information needs and
long, content-rich documents. The fundamental issue is not computational--it is
intelligent content selection: identifying what matters in lengthy,
multi-faceted texts. While humans naturally anchor their understanding around
key entities and concepts, neural models process text within rigid token
windows, treating all interactions as equally important and missing critical
semantic signals. We introduce REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that mimics
human-like understanding by using entities as a "semantic skeleton" to guide
attention. REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into the attention
mechanism, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic
reasoning. This relevance-guided attention enables the model to focus on
conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term
matches. REGENT achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging
datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently
outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to successfully integrate entity semantics
directly into neural attention, establishing a new paradigm for entity-aware
information retrieval.

*Daniel Berhane Araya,Duoduo Liao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinVet is a multi-agent framework that combines two RAG pipelines with external fact-checking using confidence-weighted voting to detect financial misinformation, providing transparent evidence-backed verdicts with source attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation causing billions in losses, and existing approaches lack transparency and proper source attribution.

Method: Multi-agent framework integrating two RAG pipelines with external fact-checking using confidence-weighted voting mechanism and adaptive three-tier processing that adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence.

Result: Achieves F1 score of 0.85 on FinFact dataset - 10.4% improvement over best individual pipeline and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

Conclusion: FinVet provides effective financial misinformation detection with transparent evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and uncertainty flags.

Abstract: Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger
billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in
their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We
introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking
through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive
three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on
retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to
full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides
evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit
uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the
FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a
10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and
37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

### [448] [MTMD: A Multi-Task Multi-Domain Framework for Unified Ad Lightweight Ranking at Pinterest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09857)
*Xiao Yang,Peifeng Yin,Abe Engle,Jinfeng Zhuang,Ling Leng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture for lightweight ad ranking that handles multiple optimization tasks, ad products, and serving surfaces in a unified framework using mixture-of-experts and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of joint holistic optimization in ad recommendation systems with multiple optimization tasks (CTR, CVR), diverse ad products, and different serving surfaces, while maximizing platform, advertiser, and user value.

Method: Proposes MTMD architecture under Two-Tower paradigm with: 1) unified framework for different tasks/products/surfaces, 2) mixture-of-experts for specialized and common knowledge, 3) domain adaptation module for knowledge transfer, 4) constrained modeling of different prediction tasks.

Result: MTMD improves offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction in cost per click. Deployed in production replacing 9 production models for Pinterest ad recommendation.

Conclusion: The MTMD framework effectively handles multi-task multi-domain optimization in ad ranking, demonstrating significant performance improvements and successful deployment in production.

Abstract: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before
the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad
recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization
tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads
and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces
where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with
diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging
problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight
ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's
value are maximized.
  Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple
goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization
goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different
surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn
domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains
to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture
under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1)
handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a
unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn
both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between
domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer
between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD
improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction
in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production
for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.
