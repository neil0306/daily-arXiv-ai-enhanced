*Hyunji Lee,Wenhao Yu,Hongming Zhang,Kaixin Ma,Jiyeon Kim,Dong Yu,Minjoon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of hybrid SSM-attention models reveals sequential hybrids excel at short contexts while parallel hybrids work better for long contexts. A data-centric approach using paraphrase-augmented training enhances recall capabilities across different base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand architectural design choices in hybrid models combining state space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, and to improve their effectiveness through systematic analysis and complementary methods.

Method: Analyzed sequential vs parallel integration of SSM and attention layers, and introduced a data-centric approach using continual training on datasets augmented with paraphrases.

Result: Sequential hybrids perform better on shorter contexts, parallel hybrids are more effective for longer contexts. Paraphrase-augmented training enhances recall while preserving other capabilities and outperforms architectural modifications.

Conclusion: Provides deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to different use cases, with data-centric approaches being effective for enhancing recall.

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine state space models (SSMs) with attention
mechanisms have shown strong performance by leveraging the efficiency of SSMs
and the high recall ability of attention. However, the architectural design
choices behind these hybrid models remain insufficiently understood. In this
work, we analyze hybrid architectures through the lens of memory utilization
and overall performance, and propose a complementary method to further enhance
their effectiveness. We first examine the distinction between sequential and
parallel integration of SSM and attention layers. Our analysis reveals several
interesting findings, including that sequential hybrids perform better on
shorter contexts, whereas parallel hybrids are more effective for longer
contexts. We also introduce a data-centric approach of continually training on
datasets augmented with paraphrases, which further enhances recall while
preserving other capabilities. It generalizes well across different base models
and outperforms architectural modifications aimed at enhancing recall. Our
findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and
offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to various use
cases. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention
models and offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to
various use cases.

*Lívia Dutra,Arthur Lorenzi,Laís Berno,Franciany Campos,Karoline Biscardi,Kenneth Brown,Marcelo Viridiano,Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Olívia Guaranha,Erik Santos,Sofia Reinach,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A methodology using semantic frames to identify gender-based violence reports in e-medical records, achieving 0.726 precision on Brazilian Portuguese data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underreporting of gender-based violence in healthcare records and improve health surveillance through automated detection.

Method: Uses semantic frames to define fine-grained patterns, searches unstructured text in e-medical records, with manual evaluation by linguists to measure precision.

Result: Achieved 0.726 precision in identifying violence reports from 21 million sentences in Brazilian Portuguese e-SUS APS records.

Conclusion: The methodology is effective, robust, and can be adapted to other health surveillance contexts as a transparent, efficient, low-carbon, language-agnostic NLP pipeline.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.

### [4] [Semantically-Aware LLM Agent to Enhance Privacy in Conversational AI Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27016)
*Jayden Serenari,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOPSIDED is a privacy framework that protects sensitive personal data in LLM conversations by dynamically replacing PII with pseudonyms while maintaining semantic integrity, then restoring original information in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy concerns with conversational AI systems where users share sensitive personal data with LLMs, risking PII exposure and potential security breaches or identity theft.

Method: A semantically-aware privacy agent that dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving contextual integrity, then depseudonymizes responses automatically.

Result: Evaluation using real-world ShareGPT conversations shows LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques while enhancing privacy.

Conclusion: The LOPSIDED framework effectively protects PII in LLM interactions without degrading response quality, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining conversation integrity.

Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

### [5] [Kad: A Framework for Proxy-based Test-time Alignment with Knapsack Approximation Deferral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27017)
*Ayoub Hammal,Pierre Zweigenbaum,Caio Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A proxy-based test-time alignment method using guidance from small aligned models to reduce computational costs of aligning large language models, formulated as a token-specific cascading approach with 0-1 knapsack problem deferral rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs acquire most capabilities during pre-training but require expensive alignment procedures that become prohibitively costly as model sizes scale up.

Method: Token-specific cascading method where deferral decisions are formulated as 0-1 knapsack problems, with primal and dual approximations of optimal deferral decisions.

Result: Experimental results show benefits in both task performance and speculative decoding speed.

Conclusion: Proxy-based test-time alignment using small aligned models provides an effective way to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance for large language model alignment.

Abstract: Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation
capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during
pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to
downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired
properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost
of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment,
i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described
as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is
reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual
approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the
benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.

### [6] [Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27037)
*Shang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELM is a neural architecture search method that creates compact language models through flexible search spaces and knowledge distillation, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory concerns of large pre-trained language models by developing more efficient compact models.

Method: Extends NAS with flexible search space, efficient transformer blocks, dynamic modules for dimension/head adjustment, and novel knowledge distillation losses.

Result: Models discovered by ELM significantly outperform existing methods on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks.

Conclusion: ELM provides an effective approach for discovering efficient compact language models through improved NAS techniques.

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory
requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact
language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible
search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for
dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and
effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

### [7] [Dataset Creation and Baseline Models for Sexism Detection in Hausa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27038)
*Fatima Adam Muhammad,Shamsuddeen Muhammad Hassan,Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first Hausa sexism detection dataset and explores computational approaches for detecting sexism in this low-resource language, highlighting challenges with cultural nuances and linguistic expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sexism detection is well-established in high-resource languages but remains limited in low-resource languages like Hausa due to limited linguistic resources and cultural differences in how sexism is expressed and perceived.

Method: Developed the first Hausa sexism detection dataset through community engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. Conducted a two-stage user study with native speakers (n=66) to explore sexism definitions and expressions. Tested traditional machine learning classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models with few-shot learning.

Result: Findings highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions. The study revealed a tendency for many false positives in such cases.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the importance of cultural context in sexism detection and the need for specialized approaches for low-resource languages, while establishing foundational work for Hausa sexism detection.

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

### [9] [Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049)
*Ponrawee Prasertsom,Andrea Silvi,Jennifer Culbertson,Moa Johansson,Devdatt Dubhashi,Kenny Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recursive numeral systems optimize regularity and processing complexity rather than just lexicon size vs morphosyntactic complexity trade-off, with MDL measures better distinguishing natural vs unnatural systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches failed to explain why only natural-language-like numeral systems optimize the trade-off between lexicon size and morphosyntactic complexity, requiring ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems.

Method: Used Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach to measure regularity and processing complexity, analyzing how these factors distinguish between natural and unnatural recursive numeral systems.

Result: MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity successfully capture differences between attested natural systems and unattested but possible ones, showing that ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from regularity.

Conclusion: Regularity across sets of forms is crucial for understanding optimality in language, and recursive numeral systems are efficient regarding their regularity and processing complexity rather than just lexicon size trade-offs.

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

### [10] [VISTA Score: Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27052)
*Ashley Lewis,Andrew Perrault,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VISTA is a new framework for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and sequential consistency tracking, improving hallucination detection over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination remains a major obstacle for deploying conversational AI in settings requiring factual reliability, and existing metrics are limited for multi-turn dialogue evaluation.

Method: VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue history, and categorizes unverifiable statements into four types: subjective, contradicted, lacking evidence, or abstaining.

Result: Across eight large language models and four dialogue factuality benchmarks, VISTA substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge baselines. Human evaluation confirms improved annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: By modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

*Xiaofan Guo,Yaxuan Luan,Yue Kang,Xiangchen Song,Jinxu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a confidence control method for retrieval-augmented generation that combines multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation to improve coverage, stability, and reliability in complex knowledge environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results, and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex knowledge environments.

Method: Builds hierarchical memory structure with multi-granularity knowledge representations, integrates uncertainty estimation to filter low-confidence paths, and uses optimization objective with generation loss, entropy constraints, and variance regularization.

Result: Achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency across different scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented generation and practical evidence for improving reliability and controllability of large models in complex contexts.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

*Michał Zawalski,Meriem Boubdir,Klaudia Bałazy,Besmira Nushi,Pablo Ribalta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDeC is a practical method to detect training data contamination in LLMs by measuring how in-context learning affects model performance, distinguishing memorized vs unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect and quantify training data contamination in large language models, especially for models with undisclosed training corpora where memorization patterns need to be identified.

Method: Uses in-context learning effects - measures how in-context examples affect model confidence (boost for unseen data, may reduce for memorized data due to disrupted patterns).

Result: Produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and unseen datasets, reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight models.

Conclusion: CoDeC is simple, automated, model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark evaluations for contamination detection.

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

*Jiasen Zheng,Huajun Zhang,Xu Yan,Ran Hao,Chong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a fine-tuning method combining contrastive distillation and noise-robust training to improve safety alignment and robustness in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of large-scale language models in safety alignment and robustness by developing a more effective fine-tuning approach.

Method: Freezes backbone model and transfers teacher model knowledge through distillation, while introducing noise perturbations and robust optimization constraints during training.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness, and overall safety across multiple key metrics.

Conclusion: Enriches theoretical system of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and provides new solution for building safer and more trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

### [14] [Characterizing Selective Refusal Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27087)
*Adel Khorramrouz,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM safety guardrails can create selective refusal bias, where models refuse harmful content for some demographic groups but not others, leading to inequitable protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how safety measures in LLMs may inadvertently introduce biases by selectively refusing to generate harmful content for certain demographic groups while allowing it for others.

Method: Analyzed refusal rates across targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups, examined types of LLM responses, and measured length of generated refusals. Also conducted indirect attacks targeting previously refused groups.

Result: Found evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and religion attributes. Models showed inconsistent protection across different demographic groups.

Conclusion: Safety guardrails need more equitable and robust performance across all demographic groups to prevent selective refusal bias and ensure fair protection.

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

*Rajarshi Haldar,Julia Hockenmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based evaluation of NLG systems shows low intra-rater reliability across runs, making scores inconsistent and arbitrary, but proper guidelines may enable useful application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As NLG becomes widely adopted, proper assessment is difficult. LLM-based evaluation has gained traction for better alignment with human preferences than traditional metrics.

Method: Experiments quantifying LLM judges' intra-rater reliability across different NLG tasks and benchmarks, investigating if proper guidelines can enable useful application.

Result: LLM judges have low intra-rater reliability in assigned scores across different runs, making ratings inconsistent and sometimes arbitrary.

Conclusion: While LLM judges show problematic inconsistency, judicious use following proper guidelines may still make them useful for NLG evaluation.

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

*Andy Yang,Anej Svete,Jiaoda Li,Anthony Widjaja Lin,Jonathan Rawski,Ryan Cotterell,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes transformer expressivity as language models (generating strings probabilistically) rather than language recognizers, showing autoregressive and probabilistic aspects can increase expressivity and break equivalences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most expressivity studies treat transformers as language recognizers, but they are primarily used as language models in practice, creating a gap between theory and application.

Method: Characterizes probability distributions that transformer language models can express, comparing expressivity between language recognizers and autoregressive/probabilistic language models.

Result: Autoregressive transformers can be more expressive than non-autoregressive ones, and probabilistic transformers can break equivalences that hold in non-probabilistic cases.

Conclusion: The study provides a more accurate characterization of transformer capabilities in their common use-case as language models, highlighting differences from theoretical language recognizer models.

Abstract: Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers
(which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as
language models (which generate strings autoregressively and
probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that
transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper extends the URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base by adding script vectors for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710 languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages, reducing sparsity and improving coverage for multilingual research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URIEL+ suffers from data sparsity in the form of missing feature types, incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage, which limits its usefulness for cross-lingual transfer, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) introducing script vectors for writing system properties, 2) integrating Glottolog to add more languages, 3) expanding lineage imputation by propagating typological and script features across genealogies.

Result: Reduced feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increased language coverage by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), improved imputation quality metrics by up to 33%, and showed up to 6% performance gains in cross-lingual transfer tasks.

Conclusion: The extensions make URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research, particularly benefiting low-resource language support.

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

*Zixin Chen,Hongzhan Lin,Kaixin Li,Ziyang Luo,Yayue Deng,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemeArena is an agent-based arena-style evaluation framework that provides context-aware and unbiased assessment for multimodal LLMs' understanding of multimodal harmfulness in memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation approaches focus only on binary classification accuracy, failing to capture interpretive nuance across diverse contexts for multimodal harmfulness understanding.

Method: Simulates diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks, integrates varied viewpoints, and reaches consensus among evaluators for fair comparisons.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework effectively reduces evaluation biases, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences.

Conclusion: MemeArena offers valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations for multimodal harmfulness understanding.

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

*Yulin Ou,Yu Wang,Yang Xu,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS) to detect periodicity patterns in natural language information encoding, finding significant periodic patterns beyond typical structural units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the degree of periodicity in natural language's encoded information, building on recent theoretical advancements in information density.

Method: APS method using canonical periodicity detection algorithm applied to surprisal sequences of single documents, with harmonic regression modeling for confirmation.

Result: Considerable proportion of human language shows strong periodicity patterns; new periods outside typical structural units (sentence boundaries, discourse units) were discovered and confirmed.

Conclusion: Periodicity in language information is a joint outcome from structured factors and longer-distance driving factors; APS method shows promise for LLM-generation detection.

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BEAM benchmark addresses limitations in evaluating LLMs' long-term memory with coherent, diverse conversations and probing questions. LIGHT framework enhances LLM performance using three complementary memory systems inspired by human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' long-term memory abilities lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple recall tasks, making them inadequate for assessing conversational memory capabilities.

Method: 1) Created BEAM benchmark with 100 automatically generated conversations (up to 10M tokens) and 2,000 validated questions; 2) Proposed LIGHT framework with three memory systems: long-term episodic memory, short-term working memory, and scratchpad for accumulating salient facts.

Result: LLMs with 1M token context windows (with/without retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. LIGHT consistently improves performance across models with 3.5%-12.69% average improvement over strongest baselines. Ablation study confirms each memory component's contribution.

Conclusion: LIGHT framework effectively enhances LLM performance on long-context reasoning tasks by incorporating human-inspired memory systems, demonstrating significant improvements over standard approaches on the comprehensive BEAM benchmark.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

*Rajan Agarwal,Aarush Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLINK is a compute-efficient method that improves LLM performance on low-resource non-Latin scripts by injecting multilingual knowledge through latent language conditioning without changing tokenizers or retraining decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuned LLMs underperform on low-resource, non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual coupling, creating a need for efficient multilingual adaptation methods.

Method: Aligns sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder to decoder's latent space via contrastive projector, expands into K soft slots, and trains minimal adapters for frozen decoder consumption.

Result: Substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3% preference over base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged Q&A evaluations, with reduced tokenization inflation and stronger cross-lingual alignment.

Conclusion: Treating low-resource languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual alignment in lightweight LLMs, though residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity remain.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

TL;DR: MedCalc-Eval is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' medical calculation abilities, addressing gaps in existing datasets. It includes 700+ tasks across equation-based and rule-based scoring systems, with MedCalc-Env RL environment improving performance through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLM benchmarks focus on question answering and descriptive reasoning, overlooking quantitative reasoning crucial for clinical decision-making. Existing datasets like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and don't reflect real-world computational scenarios.

Method: Created MedCalc-Eval benchmark with 700+ tasks across equation-based (Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (Apgar, Glasgow Coma Scale). Developed MedCalc-Env reinforcement learning environment on InternBootcamp framework for multi-step clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-32B model within this environment.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-32B model within MedCalc-Env achieved state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with significant improvements in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.

Conclusion: MedCalc-Eval provides a comprehensive benchmark for medical calculation abilities in LLMs, with MedCalc-Env RL environment enabling improved performance. Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and contextual understanding.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and

### [23] [Why Do Multilingual Reasoning Gaps Emerge in Reasoning Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27269)
*Deokhyung Kang,Seonjeong Hwang,Daehui Kim,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The multilingual reasoning gap in language models stems from failures in understanding multilingual inputs, which can be detected and selectively mitigated through translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the multilingual reasoning gap where models perform better in high-resource languages than low-resource ones, by identifying its underlying causes.

Method: Evaluated detection methods for understanding failures and proposed Selective Translation - translating multilingual inputs to English only when understanding failures are detected.

Result: Understanding failures can be identified (supervised approaches work best), and Selective Translation bridges the reasoning gap achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only ~20% of inputs.

Conclusion: Understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing a path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

### [24] [A Unified Representation Underlying the Judgment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27328)
*Yi-Long Lu,Jiajun Song,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discovers a unified Valence-Assent Axis (VAA) in LLMs that jointly encodes evaluative judgments and factual assent, creating a mechanism where reasoning becomes subordinate to justification rather than impartial inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether judgment in AI systems relies on specialized modules or a unified, domain-general resource, particularly examining if decodable neural representations in LLMs are truly independent systems.

Method: Analyzed diverse evaluative judgments across multiple LLMs, identified the dominant VAA dimension, and conducted direct interventions to test its role as a control signal in the generative process.

Result: Found that the VAA creates critical dependencies where reasoning is subordinated to justification, steering generative processes to construct rationales consistent with evaluative states even when sacrificing factual accuracy.

Conclusion: The unified VAA architecture explains systemic bias and hallucination in LLMs, showing how coherent judgment mechanisms can systematically undermine faithful reasoning through goal-directed justification rather than impartial inference.

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

### [25] [TransAlign: Machine Translation Encoders are Strong Word Aligners, Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27337)
*Benedikt Ebing,Christian Goldschmied,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransAlign is a novel word aligner that uses the encoder of multilingual MT models, achieving strong alignment performance and significantly improving cross-lingual transfer for token classification tasks compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current translation-based cross-lingual transfer approaches for token classification require label projection using word aligners, but existing methods leveraging multilingual encoders or MT cross-attention perform poorly. There's an opportunity to better exploit MT models for word alignment.

Method: Proposed TransAlign, a word aligner that utilizes the encoder component of massively multilingual machine translation models to extract alignments, rather than relying on cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: TransAlign achieves strong word alignment performance and substantially outperforms both popular word aligners and state-of-the-art non-alignment-based label projection methods in machine translation-based cross-lingual transfer for token classification.

Conclusion: The encoder of multilingual MT models can be effectively leveraged for word alignment, providing superior performance for cross-lingual transfer in token classification tasks compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label
projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.

*Zijian Wang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThoughtProbe is an inference-time framework that uses LLMs' hidden reasoning features to guide tree-structured exploration and improve reasoning performance through discriminative scoring and branch aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs' hidden reasoning features as discriminative signals for better reasoning performance, rather than just manipulating representations to steer generation.

Method: Uses a classifier to score and rank candidates during tree expansion, prioritizes high-score candidates, then aggregates answers from all branches by marginalizing over CoT scores to find the optimal answer.

Result: Achieves significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks by effectively covering and identifying valid reasoning chains.

Conclusion: The framework's comprehensive exploration approach successfully improves LLM reasoning performance through discriminative use of hidden features and branch aggregation.

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively review NLP applications throughout the complete battery life cycle rather than focusing on single stages or methods, and address challenges in the battery domain.

Method: Used PRISMA systematic review methodology with three databases (Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Scopus), assessing 274 papers and critically reviewing 66 relevant papers.

Result: Found emerging NLP tasks in battery domain facilitating materials discovery and life cycle stages, but identified challenges like lack of standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Proposed TLP framework incorporating agentic AI and optimized prompts can help address existing challenges in battery NLP applications.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive systematic survey of the application of natural
language processing (NLP) along the entire battery life cycle, instead of one
stage or method, and introduce a novel technical language processing (TLP)
framework for the EU's proposed digital battery passport (DBP) and other
general battery predictions. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method and employ three reputable
databases or search engines, including Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers Xplore (IEEE Xplore), and Scopus. Consequently, we
assessed 274 scientific papers before the critical review of the final 66
relevant papers. We publicly provide artifacts of the review for validation and
reproducibility. The findings show that new NLP tasks are emerging in the
battery domain, which facilitate materials discovery and other stages of the
life cycle. Notwithstanding, challenges remain, such as the lack of standard
benchmarks. Our proposed TLP framework, which incorporates agentic AI and
optimized prompts, will be apt for tackling some of the challenges.

*Jiahao Liu,Zijian Wang,Kuo Zhao,Dong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntAttn-Edit is a knowledge editing method that jointly updates both MLP and attention modules in LLMs using a knowledge balancing strategy, achieving better performance than methods that only edit MLP weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing knowledge editing methods focus only on MLP modules while ignoring attention modules, which can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing effectiveness. Attention modules play a substantial role in factual knowledge storage, especially in earlier layers.

Method: Extends associative memory paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules using a knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage.

Result: Achieves higher edit success, better generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods on standard benchmarks. The balancing strategy keeps editing performance within optimal range across diverse settings.

Conclusion: Jointly editing both MLP and attention modules with balanced updates significantly improves knowledge editing effectiveness in LLMs compared to methods that focus only on MLP modules.

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces and persistent data scarcity through community-driven approaches for language technology development.

Method: Launched awaldigital.org platform enabling Tamazight speakers to contribute translation and voice data through collaborative crowdsourcing, analyzed 18 months of community engagement data.

Result: Limited actual participation with contributions concentrated among linguists and activists, modest data collection (6,421 translation pairs, 3 hours of speech), revealing barriers like limited confidence in written Tamazight and standardization challenges.

Conclusion: Standard crowdsourcing approaches have limitations for languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts like Tamazight, highlighting need for alternative strategies despite ongoing work on improved MT models.

Abstract: This paper presents Awal, a community-powered initiative for developing
language technology resources for Tamazight. We provide a comprehensive review
of the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational
resources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address
persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses
the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative
platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze
18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to
participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing
standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data
contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest
scale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of
speech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing
approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working
on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent systems relying on personalized external memory databases face challenges like memory redundancy, staleness, and poor memory-context integration due to ineffective memory updates during interaction.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm with memory entropy concept, enabling agents to autonomously maintain dynamically updated memory vector database by minimizing global entropy.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies validate effectiveness in alleviating memory bloat.

Conclusion: The work offers new insights into designing long-term memory systems for personalized AI agents, particularly in affective scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new
research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized
external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face
challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context
integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during
interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system
designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired
memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent
to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by
minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better
evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a
benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects.
Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance
in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in
alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of
long-term memory systems.

*Xuan Gong,Senmiao Wang,Hanbo Huang,Ruoyu Sun,Shiyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VCORE introduces variance-controlled optimization-based reweighting to improve supervised fine-tuning on long chain-of-thought trajectories by adaptively allocating supervision across tokens based on their contributions to reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally in chain-of-thought training, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions and leading to misallocated supervision and weak generalization in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: VCORE reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization problem from an optimization-theoretic perspective, enabling principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens.

Result: VCORE consistently outperforms existing token reweighting methods, achieving substantial performance gains on mathematical and coding benchmarks across in-domain and out-of-domain settings using Qwen3 series and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct models.

Conclusion: VCORE provides more effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning and establishes a stronger foundation for advancing LLM reasoning capabilities through adaptive token supervision.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

*Chenyang Shao,Sijian Ren,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A collaborative reasoning framework using diffusion language models (DLMs) to generate candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate them, addressing computational inefficiency in autoregressive generation while maintaining reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong reasoning capabilities but suffer from sub-optimal scaling with test-time computation due to autoregressive generation, requiring excessive computational overhead for marginal gains. DLMs can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising.

Method: Propose a collaborative framework where DLMs generate diverse candidate thoughts in a single forward pass, and LLMs evaluate the quality of these thoughts to enhance reasoning efficiency.

Result: Experiments across diverse benchmarks show strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, achieving efficient reasoning with reduced computational burden while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising direction for efficient reasoning by leveraging the complementary strengths of DLMs and LLMs, with open-source code available for future research.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: This study compares computational embeddings (GloVe vs BERT) with human semantic judgments for English compound words, finding BERT better captures compositional semantics and predictability is a key factor in semantic transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well computational embeddings align with human semantic judgments in processing English compound words, advancing computational psycholinguistics.

Method: Compared static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human ratings of lexeme meaning dominance and semantic transparency using association strength, frequency, and predictability measures with correlation and regression analyses.

Result: BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than GloVe, and predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic transparency in both human and model data.

Conclusion: The findings clarify factors driving compound word processing and offer insights into embedding-based semantic modeling, advancing computational psycholinguistics.

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

*Mahi Aminu,Chisom Chibuike,Fatimo Adebanjo,Omokolade Awosanya,Samuel Oyeneye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines two causal domain generalization methods for low-resource NLP tasks: causal data augmentation using counterfactual examples and invariant causal representation learning with DINER framework, showing improved robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often fail in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, especially in low-resource settings with data scarcity and limited domain diversity. Domain generalization aims to address this by learning invariant features across domains.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Causal data augmentation (CDA) that generates counterfactual examples for sentiment classification on NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, creating semantically equivalent paraphrases to simulate distribution shifts. 2) Invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) using DINER framework adapted to multilingual setting for debiasing aspect-based sentiment analysis.

Result: Both approaches enhanced robustness to unseen domains: CDA yielded consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment classification, while DINER improved out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, though with varying gains across different languages.

Conclusion: Causal domain generalization techniques, particularly counterfactual data augmentation and invariant causal representation learning, are effective for improving model robustness in low-resource NLP settings facing distribution shifts.

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

TL;DR: BiSparse-AAS is a novel transformer framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear attention to improve efficiency and performance in text summarization, achieving significant ROUGE score improvements on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer architectures have quadratic complexity that limits scalability on long documents, creating a need for more efficient approaches to text summarization.

Method: Combines sparse attention (reduces computational costs), adaptive spans (dynamically adjusts attention ranges), and bilinear attention (models complex token interactions) in a unified framework.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with average ROUGE improvements of 68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets.

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution for real-world text summarization by addressing efficiency, scalability, and long-sequence modeling challenges.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLSpace is a human-interpretable representation for text-to-SQL examples that enables detailed analysis of benchmarks, model performance, and query rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a compact, interpretable representation for text-to-SQL examples that facilitates deeper analysis beyond simple accuracy metrics and enables targeted improvements.

Method: Developed SQLSpace representations derived with minimal human intervention, then applied them to compare benchmark compositions, analyze model performance granularly, and improve performance through query rewriting based on correctness estimation.

Result: SQLSpace revealed compositional differences between benchmarks, exposed performance patterns obscured by accuracy alone, and successfully supported modeling of query success for targeted improvements.

Conclusion: SQLSpace enables sophisticated analysis of text-to-SQL systems that would be difficult with raw examples alone, providing valuable insights for benchmark design and model improvement.

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS) as a new AI standard for clinical summarization that captures patient values, preferences and psychosocial context, and evaluates open-source LLMs against human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-generated clinical summaries focus too much on biology and miss patients' preferences, values, wishes, and concerns, which are essential for patient-centered care.

Method: Mixed-methods approach involving patient and clinician interviews to define PCS guidelines, creation of gold-standard summaries, and evaluation of 5 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot prompting with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics.

Result: Best zero-shot performance: Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L 0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); best few-shot: Llama-3.1-8B (ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Models matched human performance in completeness and fluency but lagged in correctness and patient-centeredness.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs can generate clinically useful patient-centered summaries but still fall short of human experts in capturing patient values and ensuring accuracy, highlighting the need for continued development in patient-centered AI summarization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

TL;DR: DialectalArabicMMLU is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs across Arabic dialects, extending MMLU-Redux with 15K QA pairs across 5 major dialects to address the underrepresentation of dialectal varieties in Arabic LLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recent Arabic benchmarks have advanced LLM evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic, dialectal varieties remain underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.

Method: Manual translation and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs from MMLU-Redux into five major Arabic dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, Moroccan), creating 15K QA pairs across 32 domains.

Result: Evaluation of 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs (1B-13B parameters) revealed substantial performance variation across dialects, showing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, promoting more inclusive evaluation and future model development.

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain adaptation through further pre-training on medical corpora significantly improves multilingual BERT performance on healthcare NLP tasks for low-resource languages (Dutch, Romanian, Spanish), with clinical domain adaptation outperforming general biomedical adaptation and showing cross-lingual transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of domain-specific NLP tools for low-resource languages in healthcare applications, and underexplored medical NLP tasks in these languages despite multilingual BERT's potential.

Method: Four experiments of further pre-training multilingual BERT on domain-specific corpora, followed by fine-tuning on three downstream tasks: Dutch patient screening, Romanian and Spanish clinical named entity recognition.

Result: Domain adaptation significantly enhanced task performance, with clinical domain-adapted models outperforming general biomedical domain-adapted models. Evidence of cross-lingual transferability was observed.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and cross-lingual transfer are feasible and effective strategies for developing multilingual medical NLP systems in low-resource language settings, providing guidance to mitigate training data scarcity.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

*Inacio Vieira,Antonio Castaldo,James O'Doherty,Sheila Castilho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CPO enables data-efficient domain adaptation by using the base model's raw output as rejected translations and human-approved TM entries as chosen ones, achieving similar performance to SFT with 10x less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need domain adaptation but SFT is expensive; CPO offers a more data-efficient alternative by leveraging the model's own outputs as contrastive signals.

Method: Synthesize preference pairs using base model's raw output as 'rejected' and human-approved TM entries as 'chosen', applying CPO to simulate post-editing workflow.

Result: With only 14.7k preference pairs, CPO achieves performance close to SFT trained on 160k+ samples in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean MT tasks.

Conclusion: CPO provides significant data efficiency for domain adaptation and generalizes to other generative tasks where initial drafts can contrast with golden references.

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

TL;DR: MARAG-R1 is a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval mechanisms for broader and more precise information access in corpus-level reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems rely on single retrievers with fixed top-k selection, limiting access to narrow subsets of corpus and becoming the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition, especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning.

Method: Proposes MARAG-R1 framework with four retrieval tools (semantic search, keyword search, filtering, aggregation) and uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning to learn how and when to use tools, enabling interleaving of reasoning and retrieval.

Result: Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA show MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The multi-tool RAG framework with reinforcement learning enables dynamic coordination of retrieval mechanisms, overcoming limitations of single-retriever approaches and achieving superior performance in comprehensive information acquisition tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are
inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual
inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecAttn is a training-free method that integrates with speculative decoding to enable efficient sparse attention in LLMs by reusing draft model attention weights to identify important tokens, reducing KV cache accesses by over 75% with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face computational bottlenecks during inference due to quadratic complexity of self-attention, especially with long contexts. Existing methods struggle with efficiency while maintaining output quality.

Method: Uses three techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft attention patterns, and dynamic KV cache pruning guided by these predictions.

Result: Achieves over 75% reduction in KV cache accesses with only 15.29% increase in perplexity on PG-19 dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

Conclusion: Speculative execution can be enhanced to provide approximate verification without significant performance degradation, demonstrating efficient reuse of computational work in standard speculative decoding pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

TL;DR: CultureCartography is a mixed-initiative methodology where LLMs identify knowledge gaps through low-confidence questions, and humans fill these gaps while steering towards culturally salient topics, implemented in CultureExplorer tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need culture-specific knowledge that may not be learned during pre-training, requiring identification of knowledge that is salient to in-group users but unknown to LLMs.

Method: Mixed-initiative collaboration: LLM initializes annotation with low-confidence questions, human respondents fill gaps and steer towards salient topics through direct edits, implemented in CultureExplorer tool.

Result: CultureExplorer more effectively produces knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts Llama-3.1-8B accuracy by up to 19.2% on culture benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mixed-initiative collaboration between LLMs and humans effectively identifies and fills culture-specific knowledge gaps, improving model performance on cultural benchmarks.

Abstract: To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific
knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such
knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The
most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define
challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or
users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge
extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,
where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs
steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's
goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.
Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has
low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps
therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model
towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a
tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer
LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces
knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even
with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B
by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

TL;DR: CALM introduces continuous next-vector prediction to replace discrete next-token generation, compressing K tokens into single vectors to reduce generative steps by factor K, achieving better performance-compute trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the fundamental efficiency limitation of sequential token-by-token generation in LLMs by increasing semantic bandwidth per generative step.

Method: Use high-fidelity autoencoder to compress K tokens into continuous vectors, model language as sequence of continuous vectors, and develop likelihood-free framework for training, evaluation, and sampling.

Result: Achieves performance of strong discrete baselines at significantly lower computational cost, with over 99.9% token reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: Next-vector prediction establishes a powerful and scalable pathway towards ultra-efficient language models.

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models find reading measurement instruments surprisingly challenging despite being effortless for humans, highlighting a gap in fine-grained spatial perception.

Method: Created MeasureBench with real-world and synthesized measurement images using an extensible pipeline for procedural gauge generation with controllable visual attributes.

Result: Even the strongest VLMs struggle with measurement reading, particularly in indicator localization - models can read digits but misidentify pointer positions, leading to large numeric errors.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have fundamental limitations in fine-grained spatial grounding, and the benchmark can help advance visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework for multi-institutional QCT that addresses domain shift using adversarial and statistical alignment to enable scanner-agnostic proximal femur segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks trained on one dataset often fail when applied to another due to domain shift from varying scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics, which hinders multi-center osteoporosis research and reproducibility.

Method: Developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework using 3D TransUNet backbone with two complementary strategies: adversarial alignment via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).

Result: Trained and validated on one of the largest hip fracture cohorts (1,024 QCT images from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota) for proximal femur segmentation.

Conclusion: The dual alignment mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail for reliable multi-institutional QCT analysis.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS introduces Directional Consistency-driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing primitive count by up to 30% while improving reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Adaptive Density Control uses only positional gradient magnitudes for primitive splitting, which can lead to redundant splitting and suboptimal primitive placement.

Method: Incorporates Directional Consistency of gradients through angular coherence to better capture local structural complexities, and uses DC to define optimal split positions that align with local structures.

Result: Reduces number of primitives by up to 30% compared to existing ADC methods while greatly enhancing reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: DC4GS provides more efficient and accurate primitive management for 3D Gaussian Splatting by leveraging directional gradient information for both splitting decisions and placement optimization.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SACL is a dynamic curriculum learning method for lung nodule detection that adapts to data scale, outperforming static methods in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle in clinical settings with limited annotated data, and traditional static curriculum learning fails in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) with adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization, evaluated on LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11.

Result: SACL achieves comparable performance to static curriculum learning on full dataset, but shows 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data respectively.

Conclusion: SACL enables robust training across varying data scales without architectural modifications, providing a practical solution for healthcare institutions with limited annotation resources.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

TL;DR: Proposed Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net for automated brain lesion segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple pathologies with improved generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for brain lesion segmentation are specialized point solutions lacking generalization and showing high performance variance, limiting clinical reliability.

Method: Hybrid architecture with multi-stream CNN encoders, Swin Transformer bottleneck, dynamic cross-modal attention fusion, hierarchical gated decoder, trained with variance reduction strategy combining pathology-specific augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling.

Result: Achieved SOTA DSC of 0.831 (HD95: 3.03) on WMH dataset, best boundary accuracy on ISLES 2022 (HD95: 9.69), and highest DSC of 0.8651 for tumor core on BraTS 2020.

Conclusion: The unified adaptive framework provides robust and clinically feasible solution for automated brain lesion segmentation across multiple pathologies.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source

*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFAT model for live video comment generation using semantic frame aggregation and weighted frame prioritization based on viewer interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook prioritizing relevant video frames for contextually appropriate comments in live streaming platforms.

Method: Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) using CLIP's multimodal knowledge, weighted frame aggregation, and cross-attention comment decoder.

Result: Created large English video comments dataset from Twitch (438 hours, 3.2M comments across 11 categories) and demonstrated SFAT's effectiveness over existing methods.

Conclusion: SFAT successfully addresses frame prioritization for contextual comment generation in live video streams.

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed IRD framework effectively addresses key challenges in incremental HOI detection, showing strong performance in dynamic open-world environments.

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM is a fine-tuned version of SAM specifically for autonomous driving semantic segmentation, featuring dual-encoder architecture and deformable decoder that achieves superior performance on road scene datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt the general-purpose Segment Anything Model (SAM) for the specific challenges of autonomous driving scenes, which have complex spatial and geometric characteristics that require specialized handling.

Method: Uses dual-encoder combining SAM's ViT-H for global context with ResNet-50 for local details, deformable fusion module for feature alignment, and multi-stage decoder with deformable attention. Trained with hybrid loss combining Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses.

Result: Achieves 68.1 mIoU on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU. Shows strong cross-domain generalization (0.87 retention score), faster convergence (30-40 epochs), and data efficiency (0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples).

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models enable reliable and scalable autonomous driving perception, demonstrating the value of domain-specific fine-tuning for complex road scenes.

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

TL;DR: HiT is a hierarchical neural field representation for 3D shapes that learns general hierarchies in an unsupervised manner across different shape categories using a hierarchical transformer with compressed codebook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn general hierarchical structures in 3D shapes across different categories without supervision, overcoming limitations of previous methods that use fixed hierarchical structures.

Method: Uses hierarchical transformer (HiT) with compressed codebook to learn parent-child relationships in tree hierarchy, automatically identifying common substructures across shape categories without fixed structure constraints.

Result: Successfully captures meaningful containment relationships between parent and child nodes and demonstrates effectiveness through unsupervised shape segmentation across all 55 ShapeNet categories.

Conclusion: HiT provides a flexible approach for learning complex hierarchical structures from 3D shape data in an unsupervised manner, enabling multi-level granularity segmentation across diverse shape categories.

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

TL;DR: ZEBRA is a zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that disentangles fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components, enabling generalization to unseen subjects without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI-to-image reconstruction methods rely on subject-specific models or fine-tuning, limiting scalability and real-world applicability.

Method: Uses adversarial training to decompose fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components, isolating subject-invariant semantic representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics.

Conclusion: Represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding by eliminating the need for subject-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small indoor scenes, but there's great potential for forest applications like wildfire response. However, collecting real-world forest datasets is costly and infeasible.

Method: Built a pipeline using Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams Environment to collect aerial and ground views with ground-truth camera poses and multiple data modalities from UAVs, with flexible environmental controls.

Result: Created WildfireX-SLAM dataset with 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images covering 16 km² forest area, and conducted benchmark revealing unique challenges for 3DGS-based SLAM in forests.

Conclusion: The dataset enables research on 3DGS-based SLAM for forest environments and wildfire applications, highlighting areas for future improvement in this challenging domain.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

Conclusion: E-MMDiT serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes to democratizing generative AI models through its efficiency and accessibility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal

competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

### [59] [Improving Cross-view Object Geo-localization: A Dual Attention Approach with Cross-view Interaction and Multi-Scale Spatial Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27139)
*Xingtao Ling Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) and Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) to improve cross-view object geo-localization by enabling better information transfer between views and refining spatial relationship features, while also introducing a new G2D dataset for Ground-to-Drone localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view object geo-localization methods fail to effectively transfer information between views and don't refine spatial relationship feature maps, causing models to focus on irrelevant edge noise and affecting localization performance.

Method: Proposes CVCAM for multiple iterations of interaction between views to exchange contextual information and suppress edge noise, and MHSAM using convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract multi-scale spatial features. Also creates a new G2D dataset for Ground-to-Drone localization.

Result: Extensive experiments on CVOGL and G2D datasets show the proposed method achieves high localization accuracy and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CVCAM and MHSAM modules effectively address limitations in cross-view information transfer and feature refinement, leading to improved object geo-localization performance, while the new G2D dataset fills an important gap in Ground-to-Drone localization tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

*Jiacheng Hong,Kunzhen Wu,Mingrui Yu,Yichao Gu,Shengze Xue,Shuangjiu Xiao,Deli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a hierarchical generative framework for 3D scene generation that enables iterative scene expansion through multi-step associative semantic spatial composition, outperforming single-stage methods in layout plausibility and user preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-step generation methods struggle to balance scene complexity with minimal user input, while human cognitive processes in scene modeling progress from global to local with semantic association.

Method: Proposes HiGS framework with Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG) that dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic dependencies, supporting recursive layout optimization and one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and objects.

Result: HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, offering controllable and extensible 3D scene construction.

Conclusion: HiGS provides an efficient paradigm for 3D scene generation that mimics human cognitive processes, enabling fine-grained control while maintaining spatial and geometric consistency throughout the generation process.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

*Yuanhao Tang,Xuechao Zou,Zhengpei Hu,Junliang Xing,Chengkun Zhang,Jianqiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFM-Net is a novel framework for remote sensing image scene classification that combines CNN for local texture modeling and Mamba for efficient global sequence modeling through hierarchical fusion and Mixture-of-Experts classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image scene classification is challenging due to complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics. Existing methods struggle to efficiently integrate CNNs (good for local textures) and Transformers (good for global context) due to Transformers' high computational cost.

Method: Proposes AFM-Net with two pathways: CNN branch for hierarchical visual priors and Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. Uses Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism to progressively aggregate multi-scale features from both pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual reconstruction. Features are adaptively routed through Mixture-of-Experts classifier.

Result: Achieves 93.72% accuracy on AID, 95.54% on NWPU-RESISC45, and 96.92% on UC Merced datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AFM-Net effectively addresses the challenge of integrating local and global representations for remote sensing scene classification, achieving superior performance through hierarchical fusion and adaptive expert routing.

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores using deep learning models to approximate Banff Classification scores for renal transplant biopsies through a modular, rule-based framework that decomposes indicators into structural and inflammatory components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Banff Classification is the global standard for renal transplant biopsy evaluation but faces challenges due to its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and inter-observer variability, making computational replication difficult.

Method: Researchers decomposed Banff indicators (glomerulitis, peritubular capillaritis, intimal arteritis) into structural and inflammatory components, used existing segmentation and detection tools, and mapped outputs to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines.

Result: The approach showed partial successes but revealed critical failure modes including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores matched expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations undermined interpretability.

Conclusion: Current AI pipelines have limitations in replicating expert-level grading, highlighting the need for modular evaluation and computational Banff grading standards to guide future model development in transplant pathology.

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

### [63] [Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164)
*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline combining VLMs, LLMs, and object detection to improve caption quality for high-resolution images by identifying missing objects and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with high-resolution images due to low-resolution pre-training, losing visual details and omitting important objects when downscaling.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: VLM generates initial caption, LLM identifies key objects and predicts co-occurring objects, object detection verifies predictions, and region-specific captioning incorporates newly detected objects.

Result: Enhanced captions are more detailed and reliable, with reduced hallucinations, as validated by pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses VLMs' limitations with high-resolution images, producing superior captions through object verification and hallucination reduction.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M^3Detection is a unified multi-frame 3D object detection framework that fuses camera and 4D imaging radar data through multi-level feature aggregation and spatiotemporal reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of single-frame camera-radar fusion methods that capture only partial scene information and suffer from image degradation and radar sparsity, while addressing computational challenges of multi-frame fusion.

Method: Uses intermediate features from baseline detector with tracker-generated reference trajectories. Features global-level inter-object feature aggregation guided by radar, local-level inter-grid feature expansion along trajectories, and trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed M^3Detection framework successfully addresses multi-frame fusion challenges and provides robust 3D object detection by leveraging complementary camera and 4D radar modalities through efficient multi-level feature aggregation.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

*Yucheng Xing,Jinxing Yin,Xiaodong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCER is a diffusion-based framework for realistic single-person dance synthesis that enhances reference image details and extends motion guidance through specialized modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation, especially for human-involved content like dancing, is challenging due to high quality requirements and continuity needs. Human motions have high degrees of freedom, making dance synthesis particularly difficult.

Method: Built on stable video diffusion model, DANCER introduces two key modules: Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus on reference image details, and Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. Also created TikTok-3K dataset for enhanced training.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model effectively generates realistic dance videos with good continuity and detail.

Conclusion: DANCER successfully addresses the challenges of human dance video generation through specialized conditioning modules and enhanced training data, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in realistic single-person dance synthesis.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2-Cache is a hierarchical caching mechanism that accelerates diffusion model inference by separating denoising into structure-defining and detail-refining stages, achieving up to 5.08x speedup while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face practical deployment challenges due to high computational costs of iterative denoising. Existing caching methods create a trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and computational overhead.

Method: H2-Cache uses a hierarchical dual-threshold system to selectively cache structure and detail stages separately, with pooled feature summarization (PFS) for efficient similarity estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on Flux architecture show H2-cache achieves up to 5.08x acceleration while maintaining nearly identical image quality to baseline, outperforming existing caching methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: H2-cache effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma in diffusion models, significantly lowering the barrier for real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

*Guanchong Huang,Song Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SilhouetteTell is a video identification attack that uses subtitle silhouettes' spatiotemporal features to infer both online and offline videos, achieving high accuracy from distances up to 40 meters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video identification attacks threaten privacy by revealing viewing habits that can expose personal attributes like hobbies, beliefs, and health status, potentially leading to profiling, discrimination, or blackmail.

Method: The method analyzes subtitle silhouettes displayed on screen, combining spatial (silhouette shape) and temporal (time differences between subtitles) information to create spatiotemporal features that correlate with subtitle files.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on smartphones show SilhouetteTell effectively infers video titles and clips under various conditions, including from distances up to 40 meters.

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell demonstrates a practical and effective video identification attack using subtitle silhouettes, highlighting significant privacy vulnerabilities in video streaming that work for both online and offline content.

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

*Guozheng Zheng,Jian Guan,Mingjie Xie,Xuanjia Zhao,Congyi Fan,Shiheng Zhang,Pengming Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPHR is a dual-level progressive hardness-aware reweighting strategy for cross-view geo-localization that addresses viewpoint gaps and hard negatives through sample-level difficulty assessment and batch-level adaptive loss weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mining or reweighting strategies for cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery use static weighting, which is sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence.

Method: Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) with: 1) Sample-level Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module that evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives; 2) Batch-level Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism that uses training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients early and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures.

Result: Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness and robustness, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DPHR provides an effective solution for cross-view geo-localization by addressing the limitations of static weighting through progressive hardness-aware reweighting at both sample and batch levels.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

*Zixuan Hu,Yongxian Wei,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Lei Li,Chun Yuan,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse model inversion method that selectively inverts semantic foregrounds while avoiding noisy backgrounds and spurious correlations, achieving up to 3.79x speedup over dense inversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense inversion methods are inefficient for high-resolution images from large-scale ViTs due to redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and unintended inversion of spurious correlations (hallucination).

Method: A plug-and-play sparse model inversion strategy that selectively inverts semantic foregrounds while stopping inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations, without modifying original loss functions.

Result: Achieves significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79x faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse model inversion approach effectively addresses inefficiency issues in existing methods and enables faster inversion while preserving downstream task performance.

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIVA, a new multimodal deception detection task using Werewolf game data, and finds that current MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle significantly with distinguishing truth from deception in dynamic conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more integrated into human lives, robust social intelligence including deception detection is crucial. Current MLLMs have impressive multimodal capabilities but their performance in detecting deception remains unquantified.

Method: Created Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA) task using a novel dataset from Werewolf game with synchronized video, text, and verifiable ground-truth labels. Established benchmark to evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: Significant performance gap found - even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to reliably distinguish truth from falsehood. Models fail to ground language in visual social cues and may be overly conservative in alignment.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for novel approaches to build more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems that can effectively detect deception in multimodal interactions.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

*Jiaxin Zhang,Zehong Zhu,Junye Deng,Yunqin Li,and Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to analyze village spatial morphology, addressing limitations of single-disciplinary approaches and qualitative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing village studies use single-disciplinary perspectives and qualitative analysis, constrained by lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data. Urbanization is causing disappearance of spatial characteristics and landscape homogenization.

Method: Proposes HGNN model with input/communication nodes and static/dynamic edges. Combines GCN and GAT with two-stage feature update mechanism. Introduces relational pooling and joint training strategy across 17 village subtypes.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements in multimodal fusion and classification. Joint optimization lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 to 0.82/0.90, with 6% gain for parcel tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides scientific evidence for exploring village spatial patterns and generative logic, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual self-supervised learning framework for chest CT images that addresses domain shifts from different window settings while ensuring data privacy through latent replay and feature distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in medical image diagnosis including scarcity of large annotated datasets, domain shifts from different CT window settings, and privacy constraints that prevent data reuse in traditional continual learning approaches.

Method: Uses continual pretraining on unlabeled images with latent replay-based mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting, and incorporates feature distillation combining Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE) for robust representations.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on chest CT images across two different window settings compared to other approaches, showing effective learning of domain-shift-robust features.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables continual learning of diverse features from multi-window chest CT images while maintaining data privacy and addressing domain shift challenges.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecAware is a hyperspectral foundation model that uses sensor meta-attributes and hypernetworks to enable unified multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping, achieving superior performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI foundation models overlook sensor meta-attributes and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their transferability across different sensors and scenes.

Method: Two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding: 1) Meta-content aware module fuses sensor attributes and image content, 2) HyperEmbedding module uses hypernetworks to generate adaptive matrix factors for channel-wise encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show SpecAware learns superior feature representations and excels in land-cover semantic segmentation, change detection, and scene classification.

Conclusion: SpecAware establishes a unified framework for joint pre-training across diverse sensors and can adaptively process variable spectral channels, enabling better generalization in HSI applications.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up 3D models is challenging due to geometric supervision complexity and 3D data diversity. Current limitations in 3D model scaling need to be overcome to match the scaling success seen in language and vision models.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for dynamic feature routing to task-specific experts, incorporates confidence-based depth refinement module, integrates dense semantic features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations, and employs tailored loss functions for robust learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective downstream applications without extra computation.

Conclusion: MoRE successfully addresses 3D model scaling challenges through its MoE architecture and specialized modules, demonstrating superior performance in 3D geometric reconstruction tasks while maintaining computational efficiency for downstream applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves

*Tianli Liao,Ran Wang,Siqing Zhang,Lei Li,Guangen Liu,Chenyang Zhao,Heling Cao,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-IR is a self-supervised image retargeting method that uses mesh warping optimization guided by object appearance consistency and geometric constraints to eliminate distortion in important regions without requiring manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains a challenging problem in image retargeting, and existing methods struggle to preserve object appearance while maintaining geometric integrity.

Method: Reformulates image retargeting as a learning-based mesh warping optimization problem using a CNN to predict mesh grid motions, with comprehensive objective functions including object-consistent loss, geometric-preserving loss, and boundary loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RetargetMe benchmark, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality, with efficient processing (0.009s for 1024x683 resolution) and real-time performance on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: Object-IR provides an effective self-supervised solution for high-quality image retargeting that preserves semantic object appearance while minimizing geometric distortion, eliminating the need for manually annotated datasets.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuseCPath is a framework that fuses heterogeneous pathological foundation models (FMs) for whole slide image analysis, addressing performance variability caused by different training datasets and architectures through multi-view clustering, cluster-level re-embedding, and collaborative distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models show substantial heterogeneity due to diverse private training datasets and different network architectures, leading to performance variability in downstream tasks when using features from different FMs.

Method: Proposes FuseCPath framework with three key components: (1) multi-view clustering to filter discriminative patches using multiple FMs' embeddings, (2) cluster-level re-embedding strategy to fuse heterogeneous patch-level FMs, and (3) collaborative distillation to fuse heterogeneous slide-level FMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets for lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer demonstrate that FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Conclusion: FuseCPath effectively fuses heterogeneous pathological foundation models, yielding superior ensemble performance and addressing the limitations of individual FMs in computational pathology.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase training method combining spatial and frequency domain denoising using Discrete Wavelet Transform to defend against adversarial attacks on DNNs, achieving improved classification accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their use in security-critical systems. The paper aims to develop robust defense mechanisms against such attacks.

Method: Two-phase training: 1) Train a denoising network using both spatial and frequency domain approaches with Discrete Wavelet Transform and transformer layers, 2) Retrain the classifier using denoised images to enhance robustness.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST show the method significantly improves classification accuracy, outperforming existing denoising networks and adversarial training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid spatial-frequency domain denoising approach effectively defends against adversarial attacks and enhances DNN robustness in image classification tasks.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause incorrect predictions with small input perturbations, which is a critical issue for deploying robust deep-learning systems.

Method: Utilizes contrastive loss function to train classification models with both clean and adversarially perturbed images, optimizing model parameters alongside perturbations to learn robust representations.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in model robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face challenges in zero-shot action recognition due to ambiguity from multi-semantic words in action classes, which can lead to misunderstanding of intended action concepts.

Method: Uses web-crawled descriptions processed by large-language models to extract relevant keywords, and introduces a spatio-temporal interaction module to focus on objects and action units for aligning description attributes with video content.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 81.0% on UCF-101, 53.1% on HMDB-51, and 68.9% on Kinetics-600 in zero-shot experiments.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks while reducing the need for human annotation and manual attribute data creation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG shifts multi-modal RAG from document-level to region-level retrieval, using hybrid supervision to identify relevant patches and dynamic grouping for semantic regions, improving accuracy while reducing visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RAG methods use entire documents as retrieval units, introducing irrelevant visual content that dilutes focus on salient information and degrades performance.

Method: Proposes region-level retrieval with hybrid supervision from labeled/unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches, and dynamic pipeline for grouping patches into semantic regions during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on 6 benchmarks: 10.02% improvement in R@1 retrieval accuracy, 3.56% increase in QA accuracy, using only 71.42% visual tokens compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: RegionRAG improves multi-modal RAG by focusing on relevant visual regions rather than entire documents, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy through targeted retrieval.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T^3 is a test-time adaptive merging framework that dynamically combines pretrained and fine-tuned vision-language models for medical imaging using Jensen-Shannon divergence to compute per-sample interpolation coefficients, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging VLMs face a trade-off: pretrained models are robust but lack modality-specific features, while fine-tuned models excel in-distribution but fail under modality shifts. Existing merging techniques designed for natural images don't work consistently across medical modalities.

Method: T^3 uses Jensen-Shannon divergence between model output distributions to compute per-sample interpolation coefficients dynamically. T^3_B extends this to batch-wise computation to reduce inference costs. The framework is backpropagation-free and adapts merging based on model agreement.

Result: T^3 achieves state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy and error reduction across four medical modalities, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency. It preserves local precision when models agree and defaults to generalist robustness under drift.

Conclusion: T^3 provides an effective solution for adaptive medical VLM deployment, handling modality shifts through dynamic model merging without backpropagation, making it suitable for clinical settings.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

TL;DR: HyperClick is a framework that improves GUI agent reliability through uncertainty calibration, addressing overconfidence in GUI grounding tasks by combining binary rewards with spatial confidence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions, which is critical in dynamic GUI automation where single errors can cause task failure.

Method: Proposes HyperClick with dual reward mechanism: binary reward for correct actions and truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling calibrated using Brier score, jointly optimizing grounding accuracy and confidence reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven challenge benchmarks show HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing well-calibrated confidence, reducing overconfidence.

Conclusion: HyperClick enables explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, supporting more reliable GUI automation by addressing the confidence-accuracy misalignment problem.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free keyframe selection method for multimodal LLMs that treats frame selection as a combinatorial exploration problem, achieving substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keyframe selection methods for long videos either uniformly subsample or use retrieval-style scoring, which can miss informative moments and require costly pre-filtering.

Method: Formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem using multi-armed bandits, treating temporal clips as arms and using empirical means with Bernstein confidence bounds to identify informative regions in a two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure.

Result: Achieves 11.9% accuracy gain on LongVideoBench for videos longer than 20 minutes while processing less than 2% of video frames, with substantial improvements on two long-video QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an effective, simple, and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs by optimizing frame selection under strict token budgets.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### [85] [Rethinking Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27285)
*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-GRACE is a novel concept erasure method for diffusion models that uses semantic guidance to generate effective adversarial samples, achieving 26% better erasure performance while preserving non-target concepts and reducing training time by 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models use adversarial training but neglect the specificity of adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation and failure to properly fit target concept spaces due to lack of semantic guidance.

Method: S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure) leverages semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training, addressing issues of incomplete concept coverage and disruption of other concept spaces.

Result: Experiments with seven state-of-the-art methods and three adversarial prompt strategies show S-GRACE significantly improves erasure performance by 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90%.

Conclusion: S-GRACE demonstrates that incorporating semantic guidance in adversarial sample generation is crucial for effective concept erasure in diffusion models, achieving superior performance while being more efficient and preserving model integrity.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGMamba is a lightweight medical image super-resolution method that combines frequency-aware state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to achieve superior performance with under 0.75M parameters across multiple imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image super-resolution is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing acquisition costs and scanning time, but existing methods struggle to model both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details efficiently.

Method: Proposes FGMamba with two key components: Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module (GASM) that integrates state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial/channel attention, and Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that captures high-frequency details via FFT-guided fusion across multiple resolutions.

Result: Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities (Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, Endoscopic) show superior PSNR/SSIM performance while maintaining compact parameter footprint (<0.75M), outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The results validate the effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate medical image enhancement, demonstrating that FGMamba successfully unifies global dependency modeling with fine-detail enhancement in a lightweight architecture.

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASR-Net is a three-stage pipeline for coronary artery segmentation that uses multichannel preprocessing, a UNet with DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder, and contour refinement to achieve state-of-the-art performance on stenotic vessel segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of coronary artery disease is critical but poor X-ray image quality can impede diagnosis. Automated segmentation can help clinicians identify stenotic coronary arteries more effectively.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Multichannel preprocessing combining CLAHE and improved Ben Graham method, 2) Segmentation network with UNet architecture using DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder to preserve vessel continuity, 3) Contour refinement module to suppress false positives.

Result: Achieved IoU of 61.43%, DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36% on combined public datasets with both healthy and stenotic arteries, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CASR-Net provides a robust automated coronary artery segmentation tool that can support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning for coronary artery disease.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P²IOD introduces parameterized prompts for incremental object detection that adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks while constraining updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VOC2007 and COCO datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based approaches for incremental learning assume disjoint class sets across tasks, which is unsuitable for object detection due to co-occurrence phenomena where unlabeled objects from previous tasks appear in current images, causing confusion in prompts pool.

Method: P²IOD uses neural networks as parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks, leveraging global evolution properties, and employs a parameterized prompts fusion strategy to constrain structure updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate P²IOD's effectiveness in incremental object detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.

Conclusion: Parameterized prompts with adaptive consolidation properties and constrained updates effectively address the challenges of incremental object detection, particularly in co-occurring scenarios where traditional disjoint class assumptions fail.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGS is a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework that improves deformable tissue reconstruction in endoscopic surgery by addressing aliasing and artifacts from tissue movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods prioritize rendering speed but neglect aliasing and artifacts caused by tissue movement in endoscopic scenes, which degrade visualization quality.

Method: Proposed SAGS framework with attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder using 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts and capture fine tissue movement details.

Result: Superior performance on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks across all metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with better visualization quality.

Conclusion: SAGS effectively addresses aliasing and artifact issues in deformable tissue reconstruction while maintaining high rendering efficiency and improved visualization quality.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method combining image generation with deep compression for ultra-low bitrate visual communication, achieving same quality as existing methods with much less bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for ultra-low bit rate visual communication in challenging scenarios like deep space exploration and battlefield intelligence, where existing text-to-image models only provide semantic approximations insufficient for precise visual analysis.

Method: Integrates image generation with deep image compression using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models for precise visual scene generation. Both semantic text description and coding latent are encoded and transmitted at very small bit rates.

Result: Experimental results show the method achieves the same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using significantly less bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables ultra-low bitrate visual communication without sacrificing accuracy for vision analysis and human interactions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: Breast cancer detection remains challenging due to limited availability of high-quality segmentation labels, making robust classification-based approaches crucial for early detection in large-scale screening applications.

Method: The authors developed an iterative approach involving experimentation, evaluation, and refinement, focusing on classification-based methods rather than segmentation due to label limitations.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive overview of their approach but does not specify quantitative results in the abstract - they focus on the development process and design choices for their final submission.

Conclusion: Classification-based approaches are essential for advancing early breast cancer detection in MRI screening, and the authors have publicly released their implementation to support further research in this area.

Abstract: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,
breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited
availability of high-quality segmentation labels. Therefore, developing robust

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIELR is a method that converts complex image editing instructions into simple actions using LLM reasoning, avoiding joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex editing instructions and require computationally expensive joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models.

Method: Constructs structured semantic representation of input image using foundation models, then uses iterative update mechanism to refine representation for fine-grained visual representation.

Result: Surpasses previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR on SmartEdit dataset and outperforms previous methods on CIEBench benchmark.

Conclusion: CIELR enables complex image editing without joint fine-tuning, achieving superior performance in preserving consistent regions while handling complex instructions.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods primarily focus on natural images and lack support for other important visual modalities like videos and visual documents, creating a gap in multimodal representation learning.

Method: Two-stage training strategy: first stage for foundational text and multimodal retrieval, second stage with improved InfoNCE loss featuring hardness-weighted mechanism and false negative mitigation. Also uses learnable temperature parameter and model souping.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on MMEB benchmark, achieving best overall score and outperforming all prior work on challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RzenEmbed successfully bridges the modality gap in multimodal representation learning and demonstrates superior performance across diverse visual modalities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

TL;DR: FPS is a gradient-free parameter selection method that identifies optimal parameter subsets in a single forward pass, achieving comparable performance to SOTA methods while reducing memory usage by 9x and accelerating selection by 2x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods have limitations: addition-based methods cause inference latency and engineering complexity, while selection-based methods require full backward passes with high memory usage similar to full fine-tuning.

Method: FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data in a single forward pass without gradients.

Result: On 24 visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly 9x and accelerating parameter selection by about 2x.

Conclusion: FPS offers a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models by eliminating the need for backward passes while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create practical tools for synthesizing cinematic scenes for television and film production using small datasets, enabling efficient domain transfer and stylistically consistent video generation.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) Use LoRA modules in cross-attention layers of Wan2.1 I2V-14B model for visual style adaptation from small clip datasets, 2) Generate keyframes and expand them into coherent 720p sequences using the video decoder, with parallelization and sequence partitioning for faster inference.

Result: Quantitative evaluations using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, plus expert user study, show improved cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over the base model. Efficient training (hours on single GPU) and accelerated inference without quality loss.

Conclusion: The released pipeline enables practical cinematic scene synthesis with efficient domain adaptation, supporting reproducibility and adaptation across different cinematic domains.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

TL;DR: Proposes Alignment across Trees method for symmetric hierarchical feature alignment between images and text in vision-language models, using hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures and an intermediate manifold for alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods extract hierarchical features from text but represent images with single features, creating asymmetric and suboptimal modality alignment.

Method: Constructs tree-like hierarchical features for both modalities using semantic-aware visual feature extraction guided by textual cues, embeds features in hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures, and aligns them using KL distance minimization on an intermediate manifold.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed symmetric hierarchical alignment method effectively addresses modality asymmetry and improves vision-language model performance.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deepfake detection framework combining forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG traces, frequency analysis) with deep learning (CNNs and ViTs) outperforms single-method approaches and shows strong robustness to compression, adversarial attacks, and unseen manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing deepfake detection methods - deep learning lacks generalization and forensic analysis struggles with new techniques - by creating a balanced approach that combines strengths of both methods.

Method: Hybrid framework fusing forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, frequency-domain descriptors) with deep learning representations from CNNs and vision transformers.

Result: Achieved F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77 on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, and DFDC datasets respectively. Showed robustness to compression (F1=0.87), adversarial perturbations (AUC=0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1=0.79). Explainability analysis revealed 82% overlap between Grad-CAM/forensic heatmaps and actual manipulated regions.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches provide balanced solution combining deep learning adaptability with forensic interpretability, enabling resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

*Aditya Parikh,Sneha Das,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper audits fairness in breast cancer tumor segmentation, revealing age-related bias against younger patients that persists after controlling for confounders, and shows how multi-source data aggregation affects ethnic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness evaluation in deep learning for medical imaging is underexplored beyond classification, particularly in segmentation tasks. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to healthcare disparities and be amplified through iterative model development.

Method: Audited fairness of automated segmentation labels in the MAMA-MIA breast cancer tumor dataset by evaluating segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source variables.

Result: Revealed intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that persists after controlling for confounding factors like data source. Also showed how aggregating data from multiple sources influences site-specific ethnic biases.

Conclusion: Investigating data at granular levels is necessary to understand and address segmentation biases, as physiological factors may contribute to persistent age-related biases that affect both radiologists and automated systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

### [99] [Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432)
*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) by proposing methods to preserve semantic relationships in text embeddings and disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods treat all annotated text-video pairs as positives and others as negatives, ignoring semantic variation within videos and across different videos. This causes embeddings of queries and video segments for distinct events within the same video to collapse together, while similar content from different videos is driven apart.

Method: Proposes Text Correlation Preservation Learning to preserve semantic relationships in text embeddings, and Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA) with order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that the framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address semantic collapse in both text and video embedding spaces, leading to significant improvements in partially relevant video retrieval performance.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSDI is a zero-shot, self-supervised framework for blind image deconvolution that uses iterative reverse self-diffusion without requiring pre-training, achieving superior performance in recovering sharp images and accurate blur kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional blind deconvolution methods rely on handcrafted priors, while deep learning approaches need extensive pre-training on external datasets, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Formulates blind deconvolution as iterative reverse self-diffusion starting from pure noise. Uses two randomly-initialized neural networks optimized continuously to refine sharp image and blur kernel, guided by data consistency and L1-norm sparsity. Features noise scheduling for stability and kernel size robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments show DeblurSDI consistently achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: DeblurSDI provides a zero-shot, self-supervised solution that dynamically learns instance-specific priors, demonstrating remarkable robustness and outperforming traditional and deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

Result: Matches or outperforms deeper CNN and ViT variants with up to 5-20x parameter reduction. Grad-CAM analyses show consistent attention to clinically relevant regions.

Conclusion: Principled ViT redesign enables efficient and interpretable models for low-resource medical imaging settings.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPainter is a multi-agent framework that generates editable vector graphics for scientific illustrations, addressing limitations of current raster-based and code-based generation methods by providing element-level control and intuitive manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for scientific illustrations have two major limitations: raster images lack semantic structure for editing, while code-based methods are cumbersome and unintuitive. Neither approach meets the needs for efficient, intuitive, and iterative scientific creation.

Method: VisPainter uses a multi-agent framework with three specialized modules (Manager, Designer, and Toolbox) built on model context protocol to collaboratively produce vector graphics diagrams. It also introduces VisBench benchmark with seven-dimensional metrics for systematic evaluation.

Result: The framework enables true element-level control where any element can be added and modified later. Extensive ablation experiments verified the architecture's rationality and evaluation methods' reliability. Various vision-language models were evaluated with fair rankings and capability comparisons.

Conclusion: VisPainter bridges the gap between raster-based and code-based generation methods by providing an intuitive, efficient approach for creating editable scientific illustrations with element-level control, supported by a comprehensive evaluation benchmark.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

### [103] [Towards Universal Video Retrieval: Generalizing Video Embedding via Synthesized Multimodal Pyramid Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27571)
*Zhuoning Guo,Mingxin Li,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-designed framework for universal video retrieval, including a new benchmark (UVRB), synthetic data generation, and a novel training curriculum (Modality Pyramid) that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems are structurally misaligned because narrow benchmarks incentivize limited data and single-task training, suppressing universal capability due to lack of diagnostic evaluation for multi-dimensional generalization.

Method: Three-part framework: (1) Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB) with 16 datasets for capability diagnosis, (2) scalable synthesis workflow generating 1.55M high-quality pairs, (3) Modality Pyramid curriculum training General Video Embedder (GVE) using latent data interconnections.

Result: GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. Analysis reveals popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

Conclusion: The co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval by addressing structural misalignment through integrated evaluation, data, and modeling.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

*Casper Fibaek,Abi Riley,Kelsey Doerksen,Do-Hyung Kim,Rochelle Schneider*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for interactive school mapping that combines ML analysis, satellite imagery, and human validation to improve educational facility records in developing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity and infrequent updates of educational facility records in developing regions, where accurate school data is crucial for planning and resource allocation.

Method: Three-tier approach: 1) ML analysis of population density, land cover, and infrastructure to identify gaps; 2) Medium-resolution satellite imagery (later removed); 3) Very high-resolution imagery with deep learning models for detailed candidate locations, combined with interactive human validation interface.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show the framework provides scalable and cost-effective solution for educational infrastructure mapping, though medium-resolution tier was removed due to insignificant improvements.

Conclusion: The multi-tiered human-in-the-loop strategy effectively combines automated analysis with human expertise to create an accurate and complete school mapping system suitable for developing regions.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audiovisual deepfake detection methods struggle to generalize to unseen forgeries as deepfakes from advanced generative models pose serious threats.

Method: Leverages speaker-specific cues from one-shot examples to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal artifacts by matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and target content into cross-modal features, jointly reasoning about audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF datasets in cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of cross-modal identity verification for future deepfake detection.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAUTILUS, an underwater large multimodal model that addresses underwater scene understanding through a new dataset (NautData) and a vision feature enhancement module to combat underwater image degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater exploration is important for various applications but lacks large-scale multi-task datasets and suffers from image degradation issues that hinder automated scene understanding.

Method: Constructed NautData dataset (1.45M image-text pairs for 8 tasks) and proposed a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement module that uses physical priors from underwater imaging models to restore clear information.

Result: NAUTILUS consistently outperforms baselines (LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL) on most tasks across NautData and public underwater datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the VFE module.

Conclusion: The proposed NAUTILUS model with VFE module achieves superior performance in underwater scene understanding, addressing key challenges of dataset scarcity and image degradation.

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

TL;DR: ThinkMorph is a unified multimodal reasoning model that generates complementary text-image reasoning chains, achieving significant performance gains on vision tasks and demonstrating emergent multimodal intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear nature of meaningful interleaved multimodal reasoning chains and explore how text and image thoughts should function as complementary rather than isomorphic modalities.

Method: Fine-tuned ThinkMorph model on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces across tasks with varying visual engagement, learning to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps that manipulate visual content while maintaining verbal logic.

Result: Achieved 34.7% average improvement over base model on vision-centric benchmarks, matched or surpassed larger proprietary VLMs on out-of-domain tasks, and demonstrated emergent capabilities including visual manipulation skills and adaptive reasoning mode switching.

Conclusion: ThinkMorph's success suggests promising directions for characterizing emergent capabilities in unified multimodal reasoning models through complementary text-image reasoning chains.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: A robust deep neural watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection using SVD-based watermark embedding and PointNet++ for extraction, achieving superior performance against geometric and non-geometric attacks compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point clouds are vulnerable to geometric and non-geometric attacks that degrade conventional watermark signals, creating challenges for copyright enforcement in digital media.

Method: Embeds binary watermarks into singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using SVD, and leverages PointNet++ neural network architecture for robust watermark extraction under various attacks.

Result: Deep learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD methods, achieving bitwise accuracy up to 0.83 and IoU of 0.80 vs SVD's 0.58 accuracy and 0.26 IoU for severe crop attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates superior watermark recovery and maintains high fidelity under severe distortions, providing effective copyright protection for 3D point clouds.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapSAM2 is a unified framework that treats historical map images and time series as videos for automated segmentation, using few-shot fine-tuning on a visual foundation model to handle diverse tasks with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps are valuable archives but challenging to analyze automatically due to stylistic variability and scarce annotated data. Building linked spatio-temporal datasets from map time series is labor-intensive but essential for applications like dating buildings, analyzing road networks, and studying environmental changes.

Method: Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to segmentation tasks with few-shot fine-tuning. It treats historical map images as videos by processing tiles as video frames, leveraging memory attention for contextual cues. For time series, it introduces the Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and generates pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating temporal transformations.

Result: Experimental results show that MapSAM2 effectively learns temporal associations and accurately segments and links buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos.

Conclusion: MapSAM2 provides an effective solution for automated historical map analysis, enabling accurate segmentation of both images and time series with minimal annotation. The framework and dataset will be released to support future research in this domain.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Hervé Goëau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple unified principle for learning binary codes using cross-view code alignment with a single binary cross-entropy loss and coding-rate maximization regularization, achieving state-of-the-art hashing performance in just 5 training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional foundation model embeddings by developing efficient hashing methods that are simple, fast to train, and produce compact discriminative representations.

Method: Uses cross-view code alignment principle with binary cross-entropy loss for consistency across semantically aligned views, coding-rate maximization as anti-collapse regularizer, and HashCoder - a lightweight MLP with batch normalization for balanced codes. Can be used as probing head on frozen embeddings or with LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks in only 5 training epochs. Unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes, supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on single GPU. Particularly effective at 16 bits.

Conclusion: CroVCA demonstrates high efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability for large-scale retrieval through its simple unified approach to learning binary codes that balances training speed and performance.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

### [112] [ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599)
*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANCHOR is an adversarial defense framework that uses supervised contrastive learning with hard positive mining to make neural networks more robust against adversarial attacks by learning stable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit gradients to create imperceptible perturbations causing wrong predictions. Current adversarial training methods have limitations in balancing clean and robust accuracy.

Method: Proposes ANCHOR framework combining supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining. It clusters embeddings of images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions together for same-class images while separating different classes in embedding space.

Result: On CIFAR-10, achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 attacks (epsilon=0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA

TL;DR: Spatial-SSRL is a self-supervised RL method that automatically creates five spatial reasoning tasks from ordinary images to improve LVLMs' spatial understanding without costly supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving spatial understanding in LVLMs require costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scalability.

Method: Uses self-supervised RL with five automatically formulated pretext tasks: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction.

Result: Achieves average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over Qwen2.5-VL baselines on seven spatial understanding benchmarks in both image and video settings.

Conclusion: Simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

TL;DR: DUST is a dual-stream diffusion framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models by separately modeling vision and action modalities while enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing, achieving improved performance in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of jointly predicting next-state observations and action sequences due to inherent modality differences in world-model augmented VLAs.

Method: Uses multimodal diffusion transformer with separate modality streams, independent noise perturbations per modality, decoupled flow-matching loss, and joint sampling with test-time scaling.

Result: Achieves up to 6% gains over baselines on RoboCasa and GR-1, with additional 2-5% boost from test-time scaling. Real-world Franka Research 3 tasks show 13% success rate improvement. Pre-training on BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains.

Conclusion: DUST effectively handles modality conflicts in VLAs, demonstrates strong performance across simulation and real-world tasks, and shows potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sketch-to-layout approach that uses user-provided sketches as intuitive constraints for graphic layout generation, outperforming state-of-the-art constraint-based methods while offering better usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout generation methods require complex user constraint specifications that reduce usability. The authors aim to provide a more intuitive design experience by using sketches as natural constraints.

Method: Proposed a multimodal transformer-based solution that takes sketches and content assets as inputs to generate layouts. Also introduced a novel method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale to avoid costly human annotation.

Result: The model was trained and evaluated on PubLayNet, DocLayNet and SlidesVQA datasets, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art constraint-based methods. The authors also released ~200k synthetically-generated sketches for public use.

Conclusion: Sketch-to-layout is a promising research direction that offers intuitive design guidance. The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between complex constraint specifications and user-friendly layout generation.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets

*Cesar H. Comin,Wesley N. Galvão*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VessShape is a synthetic dataset generation method that uses geometric priors of vessel shapes to improve few-shot and zero-shot segmentation performance across different imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in medical image analysis and poor generalization of CNNs across different imaging modalities by leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes rather than texture-based features.

Method: Introduce VessShape methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets with procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with various foreground/background textures to encourage shape-based learning.

Result: Models pre-trained on VessShape achieve strong few-shot segmentation performance (4-10 samples for fine-tuning) and notable zero-shot capabilities on real-world datasets from different domains.

Conclusion: Pre-training with strong shape bias is an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

### [118] [NegoCollab: A Common Representation Negotiation Approach for Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27647)
*Congzhang Shao,Quan Yuan,Guiyang Luo,Yue Hu,Danni Wang,Yilin Liu,Rui Pan,Bo Chen,Jinglin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegoCollab addresses immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception by introducing a negotiator to derive a negotiated common representation from local representations, reducing domain gaps between different agents' models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception causes domain gaps in shared features when agents use different fixed perception models, degrading performance. Existing methods use one agent's representation as common, which fails for agents with large domain discrepancies.

Method: Uses a negotiator to derive common representation from local representations. Features transform between local and common spaces via sender-receiver pairs. Employs structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses for better alignment.

Result: The method effectively reduces inherent domain gaps with various local representations and enables full distillation of knowledge from common representation to senders.

Conclusion: NegoCollab provides an effective solution for heterogeneous collaboration by negotiating a common representation that better accommodates agents with different perception models.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

*Ziqian Guan,Xieyi Fu,Pengjun Huang,Hengyuan Zhang,Hubin Du,Yongtao Liu,Yinglin Wang,Qang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) as a superior alternative to IoU and Wasserstein Distance for object detection, particularly for small objects, by addressing scale invariance and joint optimization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoU-based metrics perform poorly on small objects due to sensitivity to positional deviations, and Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance and has slow convergence when used as loss function.

Method: Introduces Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) which analytically demonstrates scale invariance and facilitates joint optimization of bounding box attributes through improved gradient properties.

Result: Extensive experiments on AI-TOD-v2, MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets show GCD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various detectors, outperforming Wasserstein Distance across different dataset scales.

Conclusion: GCD effectively addresses limitations of existing similarity metrics by providing scale invariance and joint optimization capabilities, making it particularly suitable for tiny object detection tasks.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Method: Unsupervised deep learning-based denoising integrated into quantitative microscopy workflows, validated using simulated data and PDE-constrained optimization, applied across multiple modalities including STXM, optical microscopy, and neutron radiography.

Result: Denoising revealed nanoscale chemical/structural heterogeneity in STXM of LFP, enabled automated particle segmentation in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduced noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography for resolving heterogeneous lithium transport.

Conclusion: Deep denoising is established as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited

Conclusion: PETAR advances 3D medical vision-language understanding by enabling spatially grounded report generation for complex 3D medical imaging data.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D

computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid

*Xiangyu Fan,Zesong Qiu,Zhuguanyu Wu,Fanzhou Wang,Zhiqian Lin,Tianxiang Ren,Dahua Lin,Ruihao Gong,Lei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phased DMD is a multi-step distillation framework that combines phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to improve generative model performance while maintaining diversity, addressing limitations in one-step and standard multi-step distillation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step distilled models underperform on complex generative tasks due to limited model capacity, while direct multi-step extension increases memory usage, computational depth, and reduces generation diversity through stochastic gradient truncation.

Method: Divides SNR range into subintervals with progressive distribution matching and score matching within each subinterval, using phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to reduce learning difficulty while enhancing model capacity.

Result: Validated on state-of-the-art image and video generation models (Qwen-Image 20B, Wan2.2 28B), Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities.

Conclusion: Phased DMD successfully bridges phase-wise distillation with MoE to address multi-step distillation limitations, providing better performance and diversity preservation in complex generative tasks.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

Motivation: To enable unobtrusive cardiac monitoring through non-contact ECG reconstruction from radar signals, overcoming limitations of fixed wavelet approaches in prior models.

Method: Uses learnable lifting wavelets with lifting and inverse lifting units in a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis model, plus multi-resolution STFT loss for temporal and spectral consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets in ECG reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate variability).

Conclusion: LifWavNet establishes a robust framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement with interpretable multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

### [125] [Towards a Measure of Algorithm Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27063)
*Shairoz Sohail,Taher Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMOC framework embeds algorithm implementations into feature space for measuring similarity, with applications in clone detection and program synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for pragmatic similarity metrics to determine meaningful differences between algorithms for applications like clone detection and program synthesis.

Method: EMOC (Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity) framework that embeds algorithm implementations into feature space using PACD dataset of verified Python implementations.

Result: EMOC features support clustering/classification of algorithm types, near-duplicate detection, and diversity quantification in LLM-generated programs.

Conclusion: EMOC provides practical similarity metrics for algorithm comparison, with released code/data to facilitate reproducibility and future work.

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

### [126] [Higher-order Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27258)
*Yifan Zhang,Zhen Qin,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HLA (Higher-order Linear Attention) is a causal, streaming attention mechanism that enables higher-order interactions with linear-time complexity, overcoming quadratic limitations of traditional attention while maintaining expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention that limits scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts, while overcoming the expressivity limitations of existing linear-time attention and State Space Models.

Method: Uses compact prefix sufficient statistics to realize higher interactions, maintains constant-size state, computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing n×n matrices, includes closed-form streaming identities, strictly causal masked variant, and chunk-parallel training scheme based on associative scans.

Result: Developed a principled, scalable building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the efficiency of modern recurrent architectures, with extensions to third and higher orders.

Conclusion: HLA provides an efficient alternative to traditional attention that maintains expressivity while enabling linear-time computation, making it suitable for scaling language models to long contexts.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to
scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention
and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically
restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit
expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal,
streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix
sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size
state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any
$n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly
causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel
training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a
serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher
orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable
building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the
efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Project Page:

### [127] [Un-Attributability: Computing Novelty From Retrieval & Semantic Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27313)
*Philipp Davydov,Ameya Prabhu,Matthias Bethge,Elisa Nguyen,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces un-attributability as a measure of semantic novelty in language model outputs, proposing that outputs are novel if no semantically similar context exists in the pretraining corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language model outputs relate to pretraining data by inverting the traditional training data attribution question - instead of asking which examples influence outputs, asking which outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining example.

Method: A two-stage retrieval pipeline: first index the corpus with lightweight GIST embeddings to retrieve top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. Outputs are considered novel if the nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference.

Result: Three key findings: (1) models use pretraining data across longer spans than previously thought; (2) some domains systematically affect novelty; (3) instruction tuning increases novelty beyond just style changes.

Conclusion: Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale, with released ~20 TB of corpus chunks and index artifacts to support replication.

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

### [128] [Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378)
*Austin Meek,Eitan Sprejer,Iván Arcuschin,Austin J. Brockmeier,Steven Basart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'verbosity' as a key factor for monitoring AI model reasoning through chain-of-thought outputs, combining it with faithfulness to create a holistic monitorability score that evaluates how well CoT serves as external working memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating chain-of-thought faithfulness focus on cases where models change answers after cues, but this misses important information when models maintain answers and doesn't examine reasoning aspects unrelated to cues. There's a need for more comprehensive monitoring of model reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce 'verbosity' - whether CoT lists all factors needed to solve tasks - and combine it with faithfulness into a single monitorability score. They evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU datasets using their proposed framework.

Result: Models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they omit key factors in their reasoning. Monitorability differs significantly across model families, showing that CoT quality varies substantially between different types of models.

Conclusion: The proposed monitorability score combining faithfulness and verbosity provides a more holistic evaluation of how well chain-of-thought outputs serve as external working memory, which is crucial for safety schemes relying on CoT monitoring. The evaluation code is released for reproducible research.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

### [129] [Atlas-Alignment: Making Interpretability Transferable Across Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27413)
*Bruno Puri,Jim Berend,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Atlas-Alignment enables transfer of interpretability across language models by aligning unknown latent spaces to a pre-labeled Concept Atlas using lightweight representational alignment, eliminating the need for costly model-specific interpretability pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods are costly and difficult to scale, requiring expensive training of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual labeling, and validation for each new model.

Method: Align unknown latent spaces to a pre-existing Concept Atlas (labeled, human-interpretable latent space) using shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques without requiring labeled concept data.

Result: Enables semantic feature search/retrieval and steerable generation along human-interpretable concepts in previously opaque models, with robust performance shown through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Atlas-Alignment amortizes the cost of explainable AI by allowing one high-quality Concept Atlas to make many new models transparent and controllable at minimal marginal cost.

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

### [130] [Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484)
*Uzay Macar,Paul C. Bogdan,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that studying single chain-of-thought (CoT) samples is inadequate for understanding causal influence in reasoning models. Instead, they propose using resampling methods to analyze distributions over possible CoTs, enabling reliable causal analysis and principled interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing work on interpreting reasoning models only examines single chain-of-thought samples, which fails to capture the full distribution of possible reasoning paths that models can generate. This limitation makes it difficult to understand true causal influences and underlying computational processes.

Method: The authors use resampling techniques to investigate model decisions through four case studies: 1) measuring causal impact of specific sentences in agentic misalignment scenarios, 2) comparing off-policy interventions with on-policy resampling for steering reasoning, 3) introducing resilience metrics to prevent repeated reasoning steps, and 4) adapting causal mediation analysis to study unfaithful CoT scenarios.

Result: Key findings include: self-preservation sentences have small causal impact on blackmail decisions; off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling; critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated; hints exert subtle cumulative influence on CoT even when removed.

Conclusion: Studying distributions of chain-of-thought reasoning via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, provides clearer narratives of model reasoning processes, and supports principled interventions for steering model behavior.

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

### [131] [Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222)
*Jaebyeong Jeon,Hyeonseo Jang,Jy-yong Sohn,Kibok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR introduces a soft task-aware routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts to capture shared and task-specific information, reducing redundant feature learning in joint invariant and equivariant representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current joint learning approaches use separate projection heads for invariant and equivariant representations, which overlooks shared information and leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient model capacity usage.

Method: Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR) models projection heads as experts that specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, reducing redundancy between invariant and equivariant embeddings.

Result: STAR shows lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings, indicating reduced redundancy, and achieves consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: STAR effectively addresses redundant feature learning in joint invariant-equivariant representation learning by modeling projection heads as specialized experts, leading to better performance in transfer learning.

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

*Jakob Hackstein,Sidney Bender*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses class imbalance in machine learning by viewing it as a condition that amplifies Clever Hans effects, and proposes using counterfactual explanations from Explainable AI to identify and eliminate these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance leads to unreliable classification performance, and existing methods focus on data or loss reweighting without addressing how imbalance amplifies Clever Hans effects through underspecification of minority classes.

Method: A counterfactual explanations-based approach using Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate Clever Hans effects that emerge under class imbalance conditions.

Result: The method achieves competitive classification performance on three datasets and demonstrates how Clever Hans effects emerge under imbalance.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel perspective on class imbalance that addresses Clever Hans effects, which has been largely overlooked by existing approaches.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective
largely overlooked by existing approaches.

*Jiarong Du,Zhan Jin,Peijun Yang,Juan Liu,Zhuo Li,Xin Liu,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposed an effective audio-visual speech enhancement system with a 'separation before dereverberation' pipeline that performs well in complex acoustic environments, achieving first place in AVSEC-4 competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most previous AVSE methods struggle with complex real-world acoustic environments containing interfering sounds and reverberation, leading to poor perceptual quality of extracted speech.

Method: Designed a 'separation before dereverberation' pipeline that can be extended to other AVSE networks, using visual auxiliary information to extract target speaker's speech from mixed audio.

Result: Achieved excellent results in three objective metrics on AVSEC-4 competition leaderboard and secured first place in human subjective listening test.

Conclusion: The proposed AVSE system effectively handles complex acoustic environments and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) is a task that uses visual auxiliary
information to extract a target speaker's speech from mixed audio. In
real-world scenarios, there often exist complex acoustic environments,
accompanied by various interfering sounds and reverberation. Most previous
methods struggle to cope with such complex conditions, resulting in poor
perceptual quality of the extracted speech. In this paper, we propose an
effective AVSE system that performs well in complex acoustic environments.
Specifically, we design a "separation before dereverberation" pipeline that can
be extended to other AVSE networks. The 4th COGMHEAR Audio-Visual Speech
Enhancement Challenge (AVSEC) aims to explore new approaches to speech
processing in multimodal complex environments. We validated the performance of
our system in AVSEC-4: we achieved excellent results in the three objective
metrics on the competition leaderboard, and ultimately secured first place in
the human subjective listening test.

*Mingcui Zhang,Zhigang Jia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fragile zero-watermarking model using dual quaternion matrix decomposition for medical image copyright protection and tampering detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images face serious risks of copyright infringement and content tampering during transmission and sharing, requiring effective protection methods.

Method: Uses dual quaternion matrix decomposition to correlate original carrier images with watermarks, generating zero-watermarking information without modifying the original image.

Result: Achieves copyright protection and content tampering detection for medical images through the proposed fragile zero-watermarking model.

Conclusion: The dual quaternion-based zero-watermarking approach provides an effective solution for protecting medical images from copyright issues and tampering risks.

Abstract: Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote
consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and
sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content
tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an
effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology
focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by
extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting
medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model
based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational
relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to
correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates
zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion
matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content
tampering detection for medical images.

TL;DR: CATArena is a tournament-style evaluation platform using board/card games to assess LLM agent learning abilities through competitive peer-learning, addressing score saturation in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM agents focus on end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, leading to score saturation and dependency on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve.

Method: Proposes iterative competitive peer-learning framework where agents refine strategies through repeated interactions and feedback. Introduces CATArena platform with four diverse board/card games featuring open-ended scoring.

Result: Experimental results show CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding, using both minimal and commercial code agents.

Conclusion: CATArena enables continuous dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities by focusing on learning ability as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Motivation: To explore whether AI can autonomously design computer system mechanisms with creativity and reasoning comparable to human experts, moving beyond black-box optimization approaches.

Method: Uses large language models in a human-inspired multi-agent workflow where specialized agents handle reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback.

Result: Generated new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling in distributed GPU clusters for LLM inference that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while providing novel insights into workload behavior.

Conclusion: Combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation enables AI to produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems, suggesting the potential for autonomous system design at human-expert levels.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the

*Tian Liang,Wenxiang Jiao,Zhiwei He,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepCompress is a framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency of Large Reasoning Models by adaptively adjusting reasoning path lengths based on problem difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving reasoning efficiency often sacrifice accuracy, and the common approach of favoring shorter reasoning paths overlooks that longer responses can contain more correct solutions for difficult problems.

Method: Uses adaptive length reward mechanism that dynamically classifies problems as 'Simple' or 'Hard' in real-time, encouraging shorter reasoning for simple problems and longer exploratory thought chains for hard problems.

Result: Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent outperformance of baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Conclusion: DeepCompress enables models to autonomously adjust Chain-of-Thought length, compressing reasoning for mastered problems and extending it for challenging ones, achieving both accuracy and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

TL;DR: SIGMA is a multi-agent framework that enhances mathematical reasoning by orchestrating specialized agents for independent reasoning, targeted searches, and knowledge synthesis through a moderator mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented models rely on single perspectives, inflexible search strategies, and struggle to combine information from multiple sources effectively for mathematical reasoning.

Method: SIGMA uses specialized agents that generate hypothetical passages for optimized retrieval from their analytic perspectives, with a moderator mechanism for knowledge integration that is context-sensitive and computation-efficient.

Result: SIGMA outperforms both open- and closed-source systems on MATH500, AIME, and GPQA benchmarks, achieving 7.4% absolute performance improvement.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive problem-solving.

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

### [140] [Visual Backdoor Attacks on MLLM Embodied Decision Making via Contrastive Trigger Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27623)
*Qiusi Zhan,Hyeonjeong Ha,Rui Yang,Sirui Xu,Hanyang Chen,Liang-Yan Gui,Yu-Xiong Wang,Huan Zhang,Heng Ji,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEAT is the first framework for injecting visual backdoor attacks into MLLM-based embodied agents using environmental objects as triggers, achieving up to 80% attack success while maintaining normal task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs enable embodied agents to perceive and act from visual inputs, but this creates a new security vulnerability where agents can be manipulated through visual triggers to execute attacker-specified policies.

Method: BEAT uses a two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL), which treats trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs to sharpen decision boundaries.

Result: BEAT achieves up to 80% attack success rate across various benchmarks and MLLMs, maintains strong benign task performance, and generalizes to out-of-distribution triggers. CTL boosts backdoor activation by up to 39% compared to naive SFT.

Conclusion: The research exposes a critical security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

*Tao Liu,Chongyu Wang,Rongjie Li,Yingchen Yu,Xuming He,Bai Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Rise is a reasoning-enhanced framework for GUI navigation agents that combines structured reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization to improve cross-domain generalization and history utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based GUI navigation agents have limitations in cross-domain generalization and effective history utilization, which hinders their performance across diverse GUI tasks.

Method: Proposed framework integrates structured reasoning (Chain-of-Thought analyses), action prediction, and history summarization. Trained through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using specialized rewards including history-aware objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong performance in out-of-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust reasoning and generalization capabilities across diverse GUI navigation tasks, validating the effectiveness of the integrated reasoning and history summarization approach.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

### [142] [Broken-Token: Filtering Obfuscated Prompts by Counting Characters-Per-Token](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26847)
*Shaked Zychlinski,Yuval Kainan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CPT-Filtering is a novel defense technique that uses the average Characters Per Token (CPT) metric from BPE tokenizers to detect and filter jailbreak attacks disguised through ciphers and character-level encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where malicious prompts are encoded using ciphers to bypass safety guardrails, while current defense methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Leverages the principle that tokenizers represent out-of-distribution text (like ciphers) using more shorter tokens, measured by the CPT metric. Uses a simple CPT threshold to identify encoded text.

Result: Validated on over 100,000 prompts with various encoding schemes and tokenizers. Achieves near-perfect accuracy in detecting encoded text, even for short inputs, with negligible computational cost.

Conclusion: CPT-Filtering provides a practical, model-agnostic defense that can be deployed immediately for real-time text filtering and offline data curation, offering high accuracy at minimal cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where
malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to
bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the
encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful
instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with
negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to
mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that
tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,
such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our
technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the
average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is
motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules
such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a
large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with
several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT
threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very
short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be
immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.

*Yunhao Yang,Neel P. Bhatt,Pranay Samineni,Rohan Siva,Zhanyang Wang,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RepV is a neurosymbolic verifier that learns a latent space where safe and unsafe plans are linearly separable, enabling efficient verification of AI plan compliance with natural-language rules while providing probabilistic guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in safety-critical domains need reliable verification of rule compliance. Formal methods require hand-crafted specifications with limited expressiveness, while deep learning approaches are opaque and prone to misclassifications with severe consequences.

Method: RepV trains a lightweight projector to embed plans and language model-generated rationales into a low-dimensional latent space where safe/unsafe plans are linearly separable. Uses a frozen linear boundary for verification and provides probabilistic guarantees based on position in latent space.

Result: RepV improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baselines while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. The guarantee-driven refinement framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning domains.

Conclusion: Safety-separable latent spaces offer a scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification, enabling improved rule compliance without human annotations.

Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their
actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods
provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic
specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep
learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language
constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with
potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier
that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans
are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an
off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds
each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a
low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for
unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the
likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.
This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving
rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV
improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline
methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement
framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning
domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a
scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

*Simindokht Jahangard,Mehrzad Mohammadi,Abhinav Dhall,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework combining panoramic images and 3D point clouds for enhanced spatial reasoning in robotics, outperforming existing VLMs on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to implicit reasoning and reliance on images alone, especially in complex robotics environments.

Method: Neuro-symbolic framework with perception module for entity detection and attribute extraction, and reasoning module that constructs structured scene graphs for explicit spatial modeling.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and reliability on JRDB-Reasoning dataset in crowded human-built environments while maintaining lightweight design.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses spatial reasoning limitations of current VLMs and is suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive
task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions
within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing
vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with
fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven
reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic
framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,
combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial
and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for
detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that
constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.
Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior
performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while
maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI
applications.

### [145] [See the Speaker: Crafting High-Resolution Talking Faces from Speech with Prior Guidance and Region Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26819)
*Jinting Wang,Jun Wang,Hei Victor Cheng,Li Liu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel speech-to-talking face method that directly generates talking face videos from speech alone, without needing source images, using a two-stage diffusion model approach with enhanced lip synchronization and high-resolution rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require source images as appearance references and source speech for motion generation, which limits their applicability. This work aims to create talking face videos using only speech input, eliminating the need for visual references.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Speech-to-face portrait generation using speech-conditioned diffusion with facial priors and adaptive weighting, 2) Speech-driven talking face generation embedding expressive dynamics into diffusion latent space with region-enhancement for lip sync, plus Transformer-based codebook for high-resolution rendering.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on HDTF, VoxCeleb, and AVSpeech datasets. Generates high-resolution, high-quality talking face videos from single speech input.

Conclusion: This is the first method capable of generating high-resolution talking face videos exclusively from speech input, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches that require both visual and audio inputs.

Abstract: Unlike existing methods that rely on source images as appearance references
and use source speech to generate motion, this work proposes a novel approach
that directly extracts information from the speech, addressing key challenges
in speech-to-talking face. Specifically, we first employ a speech-to-face
portrait generation stage, utilizing a speech-conditioned diffusion model
combined with statistical facial prior and a sample-adaptive weighting module
to achieve high-quality portrait generation. In the subsequent speech-driven
talking face generation stage, we embed expressive dynamics such as lip
movement, facial expressions, and eye movements into the latent space of the
diffusion model and further optimize lip synchronization using a
region-enhancement module. To generate high-resolution outputs, we integrate a
pre-trained Transformer-based discrete codebook with an image rendering
network, enhancing video frame details in an end-to-end manner. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on the
HDTF, VoxCeleb, and AVSpeech datasets. Notably, this is the first method
capable of generating high-resolution, high-quality talking face videos
exclusively from a single speech input.

*Riley Grossman,Michael Smith,Cristian Borcea,Yi Chen*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Study finds 38% of GDPR-compliant cookie banners use aesthetic manipulation to steer users toward data sharing, with EU websites being 48.3% more likely to use such tactics than non-EU sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how often GDPR-compliant cookie banners contain aesthetic manipulation tactics that draw attention to data-sharing buttons, and evaluate compliance with GDPR and national authority recommendations.

Method: Visited 2,579 websites from EU and US IP addresses, identified cookie banner types, and used computer vision model for salient object detection to measure attention-drawing elements and discover new manipulation types.

Result: 45% of websites had fully compliant banners, but 38% of compliant banners contained aesthetic manipulation. EU websites were 48.3% more likely to use manipulation than non-EU sites, and 13.9% of EU websites changed banner design for US users.

Conclusion: Aesthetic manipulation in cookie banners is more common than previously reported (38% vs 27%), with EU websites showing innovative responses to privacy regulation through increased use of manipulation tactics.

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study how often cookie banners that comply
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contain aesthetic
manipulation, a design tactic to draw users' attention to the button that
permits personal data sharing. As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate
how frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national
data protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites
and identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the
relevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation
on 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic
manipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to
measure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This
enables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button
placement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common
than previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user
and/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the
European Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent,
and websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU
and from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU
websites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU
websites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than
non-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.

### [147] [Dark-Field X-Ray Imaging Significantly Improves Deep-Learning based Detection of Synthetic Early-Stage Lung Tumors in Preclinical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27679)
*Joyoni Dey,Hunter C. Meyer,Murtuza S. Taqi*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI) combined with deep learning significantly improves early-stage lung tumor detection compared to standard attenuation radiography, offering a potential low-cost alternative to LDCT screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT has limited adoption and accessibility, with high false-positive rates in early cancer detection. DFI offers better sensitivity to alveolar microstructure and less organ shadowing for improved tumor detection.

Method: Used paired ATTN and DFI radiograph images of mouse lungs with synthetic tumors. Trained U-Net segmentation network on small patches using ATTN-only, DFI-only, or combined ATTN+DFI channels.

Result: DFI-only model achieved 83.7% true-positive detection rate vs 51% for ATTN-only, with comparable specificity (90.5% vs 92.9%). Combined ATTN+DFI achieved 79.6% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity.

Conclusion: DFI substantially improves early-tumor detectability compared to standard attenuation radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose alternative for screening where LDCT is unavailable.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer
screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack
LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer
detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening
Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of
26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)
radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar
microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly
improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning
segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of
euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular
boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A
U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,
or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model
achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51
percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus
92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent
sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially
improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation
radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose
alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is
unavailable.

*Chuxuan Hu,Maxwell Yang,James Weiland,Yeji Lim,Suhas Palawala,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DRAMA is an end-to-end paradigm that automates data science workflows by answering analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain data, unifying data collection, transformation, and analysis in a single pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data analysis is labor-intensive and inefficient, and existing automated systems lack the three key capabilities needed: open-domain data collection, structured data transformation, and analytic reasoning.

Method: DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single pipeline. DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system, includes a data retriever that collects and transforms data through sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs structured reasoning over retrieved data.

Result: DRAMA-Bot achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05 on DRAMA-Bench, outperforming five state-of-the-art baseline agents with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost.

Conclusion: DRAMA successfully demonstrates an effective end-to-end approach for automating data science workflows, addressing the limitations of existing systems through its unified pipeline architecture.

Abstract: Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and
inefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none
of the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key
capabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data
collection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that
answers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain
data. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single
pipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative
of DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories
of tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100
instances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have
gained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of
open-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following
DRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by
coordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs
structured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on
DRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot
achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines
with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is

TL;DR: The paper studies two types of biases in multimodal retrieval systems: prevalence bias (favoring prevalent languages) and association bias (favoring culturally associated images). It finds explicit alignment works better for prevalence bias, while association bias remains more challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal retrieval systems should operate in a semantic space agnostic to language or culture, but in practice they exhibit systematic biases shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations.

Method: The study examines two specific biases: prevalence bias in image-to-text retrieval and association bias in text-to-image retrieval, comparing different mitigation strategies.

Result: Explicit alignment is more effective for mitigating prevalence bias, but association bias remains a distinct and more challenging problem that persists despite interventions.

Conclusion: Achieving equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies beyond simple data scaling, with cultural association bias being more challenging to address than linguistic prevalence bias.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space,
agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however,
retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations
shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such
biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from
prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text
retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images
culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in
text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more
effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias
remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that
achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies
beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may
be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic
prevalence.

*Meghraj Prajapat,Alankar Alankar*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Generative machine learning models are developed to restore noisy EBSD patterns from high-speed scans, improving indexing accuracy without requiring large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EBSD methods like Hough transform and dictionary indexing struggle with noisy patterns from high-speed scans due to low signal-to-noise ratio from short exposure times, leading to reduced indexing accuracy.

Method: Develop generative machine learning models for post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns to restore noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds.

Result: The models successfully enhance pattern quality from short exposure times, and the methodology is not data-hungry compared to typical machine learning approaches.

Conclusion: Generative ML models provide an effective solution for restoring noisy EBSD patterns from high-speed scans, enabling reliable crystal orientation determination without requiring large training datasets.

Abstract: Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon
methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret
diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these
methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high
scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the
operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases
for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced
indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine
learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi
patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high
scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of
crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the
performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns
captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation
is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.
