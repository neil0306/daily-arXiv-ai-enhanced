We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of\nthese 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180\ndegree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and\nlocal feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++\nand Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on\nrelevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal\nnavigation.

Introduces auxiliary sampling to steer generation toward coherent framing.", "result": "Extensive experiments show the method generates on-frame coherent human-camera motions while improving textual alignment for both modalities. Qualitative results yield more cinematographically meaningful framings.", "conclusion": "The approach sets new state-of-the-art for joint human motion and camera trajectory generation by leveraging on-screen framing as a natural bridge between modalities, producing more coherent and cinematographically meaningful results."}}
