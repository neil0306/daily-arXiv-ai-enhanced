Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans.

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks.
