We first pre-train an action-free\njoint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset\ncomprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong\nperformance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something\nv2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7\nrecall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.\nAdditionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering\ntasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on\nTempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to\nrobotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world\nmodel, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the\nDroid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different\nlabs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.\nNotably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these\nenvironments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work\ndemonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small\namount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in\nthe physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents V-JEPA 2, a self-supervised model trained on internet-scale video data and minimal robot interaction data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion understanding, action anticipation, and video QA tasks, and enabling robotic planning without task-specific training.", "motivation": "To develop AI models that understand and act in the physical world by leveraging self-supervised learning from large-scale video data and limited interaction data.", "method": "Pre-train V-JEPA 2 on 1M+ hours of video data, align it with a language model, and post-train V-JEPA 2-AC on 62 hours of robot videos for robotic planning.", "result": "V-JEPA 2 excels in motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy) and action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5).

Unlike conventional approaches that\npredict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by\nexplicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single\nautoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe\naction that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens\nare generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and\npreviously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a\nglobal-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained\nby the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA\nincorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token\nrepresentation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;\nreverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk\nmodeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial\ngeneralization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of\na visuo-motor policy.
