### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes sentiment inconsistency between human perception (from street view images) and opinion (from social media posts) in urban areas, revealing significant disparities and their relationship with urban elements like dense buildings and pedestrian presence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms have transformed urban environment understanding, creating nuanced sentiment variations that challenge existing multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies.

Method: Constructed dataset with 140,750 street view images and 984,024 social media posts; developed reaction index using object detection and NLP; analyzed sentiment using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word frequency based on land-use distribution.

Result: Perception affective reaction trend shows shift toward more evenly distributed positive sentiment, while opinion affective reaction shows more extreme changes. Significant disparities found between perception and opinion sentiments, with relationships to dense buildings and pedestrian presence.

Conclusion: The study provides inconsistent maps showing perception and opinion sentiments before/after pandemic, offering explanations and directions for environmental management and urban renewal strategies.

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HaystackCraft is a new benchmark that creates noisy long contexts to test LLM robustness by simulating biased retrieval and agentic workflows, revealing persistent challenges in long-context reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current needle-in-a-haystack benchmarks are synthetic and overlook real-world factors like biased retrieval and agentic workflow errors, necessitating more realistic testing of long-context LLM robustness.

Method: Built HaystackCraft benchmark using full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop questions, evaluating heterogeneous retrieval strategies and extending to dynamic agentic settings where models refine queries and reflect on reasoning.

Result: Experiments with 15 models showed: (1) stronger dense retrievers create more challenging distractors but graph-based reranking helps, (2) even advanced models suffer cascading failures from self-generated distractors and struggle with early stopping in agentic tests.

Conclusion: HaystackCraft reveals persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and serves as a valuable testbed for future progress in LLM robustness.

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results in contextual lemmatization across 12 languages without fine-tuning, outperforming traditional supervised methods in cross-domain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how effective large language models (LLMs) are in contextual lemmatization tasks, particularly in scenarios where supervised training data is unavailable for target domains or languages.

Method: Compared encoder-only supervised approaches (fine-tuned out-of-domain) and cross-lingual methods against direct in-context lemma generation with LLMs using few-shot examples.

Result: LLMs reached state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, while encoders remained competitive only when fine-tuned on gold data.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are highly effective for in-context lemmatization across diverse languages, achieving superior performance compared to traditional supervised approaches in cross-domain settings.

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LASER is an LLM-based scoring rubric that addresses the limitations of WER in ASR evaluation by focusing on semantic meaning rather than morphological/syntactic differences, achieving high correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like WER unfairly penalize minor morphological and syntactic variations that don't affect sentence meaning, creating a need for more semantically-aware evaluation methods.

Method: Uses LLMs' in-context learning with detailed example prompts; also fine-tunes smaller LLMs on word-pair examples from reference and ASR predictions to predict appropriate penalties.

Result: Hindi LASER achieved 94% correlation with human annotations using Gemini 2.5 Pro; the approach also worked well for other Indian languages; fine-tuned Llama 3 achieved 89% accuracy in penalty prediction.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation methods like LASER provide more semantically meaningful ASR assessment and can be effectively adapted across related languages with proper prompting or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

### [5] [Meaningful Pose-Based Sign Language Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07453)
*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A comprehensive study on evaluating sign language utterances using skeletal poses, covering keypoint distance, embedding, and back-translation metrics with tradeoff analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide meaningful evaluation methods for sign language translation and generation systems using skeletal pose data.

Method: Automatic meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and human correlation study of text-to-pose translation across different sign languages.

Result: Shows tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios and provides an open-source pose-evaluation toolkit.

Conclusion: The findings and toolkit offer a practical and reproducible way to develop and evaluate sign language systems.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A rubric and anchor guided chain of thought prompting approach enables LLMs to classify populism in political speeches with accuracy comparable to expert human coders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional textual analysis methods for measuring populist ideational content are costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale across languages and large corpora.

Method: Used a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought prompting approach that mirrors human coder training, leveraging the Global Populism Database and prompting LLMs with adapted documentation used for human coder training.

Result: The domain-specific prompting strategy enabled LLMs to achieve classification accuracy on par with expert human coders, effectively navigating nuanced, context-sensitive aspects of populism.

Conclusion: LLMs with specialized prompting can effectively measure populist ideational content, providing a scalable alternative to traditional manual coding methods.

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO is a framework for optimizing multi-agent system prompts using Maximum a Posteriori inference and belief propagation to address challenges like exponential search space and credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems can outperform single agents but are difficult to design due to prompt sensitivity and instability. Current automated prompt design methods don't adequately address multi-agent optimization challenges.

Method: Four-stage framework that formulates MAS prompt optimization as MAP inference problem, solved using language-guided max-product belief propagation with topology-aware refinement that integrates execution feedback and downstream blames.

Result: MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, consistently surpassing manually engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives.

Conclusion: The MAP-based formulation provides general guidelines for building more reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade is an asynchronous framework that eliminates sequential dependencies in query-aware sparse decoding for test-time scaling, achieving optimal time-per-output-token by overlapping KV-cache operations with inference computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current query-aware page-level sparse decoding methods suffer from sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection, which hampers serving efficiency and model performance in high concurrency and long chain-of-thought scenarios.

Method: Proposes AsyncSpade with two core components: (1) a light-weight temporal-regressive module that predicts next-token query state from recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity; (2) an asynchronous disaggregated framework that decouples KV cache filtering from auto-regressive decoding loop.

Result: Achieves over 20% reduction in time-per-output-token compared to state-of-the-art baseline (Quest) and at least 50% reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing accuracy on various TTS benchmarks.

Conclusion: AsyncSpade is the first method to eliminate sequential dependence without sacrificing model performance, achieving theoretical optimal time-per-output-token by fully overlapping KV-cache operations with inference pipeline.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flat team structures outperform hierarchical ones in LLM-powered multi-agent systems, with diversity showing nuanced effects on performance across commonsense and social reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine team dynamics in LLM-powered multi-agent systems by applying human team science principles of structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics.

Method: Proposed a multi-agent framework evaluating team performance across four tasks (CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, Latent Implicit Hate) using different team structures and diversity levels.

Result: Flat teams performed better than hierarchical ones; diversity had nuanced impact; agents showed overconfidence in team performance but post-task reflections revealed appreciation for collaboration with limited conversational coordination.

Conclusion: Team structure significantly impacts performance in LLM-powered multi-agent systems, with flat structures being more effective, while integration challenges like conversational coordination need addressing.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT fine-tuning improves speech LLM reasoning accuracy 2.4x, while question completeness metric and DPO optimize latency-accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks and have latency issues in spoken interactions, needing improved accuracy and response speed.

Method: CoT fine-tuning for multi-stream speech LLMs, entropy-based question completeness metric for early reasoning, and DPO on preference data.

Result: 2.4x accuracy improvement on spoken reasoning tasks, 4% accuracy gain on ARC-Easy under equivalent latency, 70% latency reduction without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Reasoning in text space significantly improves speech LLMs, and controlled early reasoning with DPO optimization achieves better accuracy-latency balance.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL) uses reusable thought templates derived from problem-solving traces to structure multi-hop reasoning with long-context language models, improving performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simply feeding more documents into long-context language models fails to capture how evidence should be connected for multi-hop reasoning, creating a gap in effectively combining information.

Method: Proposes thought templates that recast reasoning as reusable caches, structuring evidence combination and guiding multi-hop inference. Includes an update strategy that iteratively refines templates using natural-language feedback from training data.

Result: Consistent gains over strong baselines across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families in both retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models.

Conclusion: The ToTAL framework demonstrates broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse, effectively addressing the challenge of structured evidence combination in long-context multi-hop reasoning.

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi transliteration that achieves superior performance across multiple domains, addressing script differences between Persian dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome script barriers between Persian dialects (Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan/Iran and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan) that hinder written communication, as previous models were limited to specific domains like poetry or word lists.

Method: Developed a sequence-to-sequence model trained across all available datasets, including two new datasets created by the authors, to handle varied domains of text.

Result: Achieved chrF++ scores of 87.91 and Normalized CER of 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik, and 92.28 chrF++ and 0.04 CER from Tajik to Farsi, setting comprehensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The model provides a versatile transliteration system capable of handling real-world usage across different domains, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

### [13] [OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07535)
*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OWL introduces a novel speculative decoding method that achieves 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through LSTM-based drafting, special token conditioning, and hybrid decoding algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods fail to generalize to real-world settings with long contexts, where current approaches degrade severely and can even slow down generation speed.

Method: OWL uses three innovations: (1) LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on last-token state for length generalization, (2) special [SPEC] token in verifier for richer representations, and (3) hybrid algorithm combining tree and non-tree decoding methods.

Result: OWL achieves about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs and addresses the degradation issues faced by current methods in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper introduces OWL as an effective solution for speculative decoding in long-context settings and releases LongSpecBench benchmark along with code and datasets to advance future research.

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

### [14] [Deploying Tiny LVLM Judges for Real-World Evaluation of Chart Models: Lessons Learned and Best Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07545)
*Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Mohammed Saidul Islam,Ridwan Mahbub,Mizanur Rahman,Amran Bhuiyan,Israt Jahan,Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Shafiq Joty,Enamul Hoque,Jimmy Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes multi-criteria prompting and domain-adaptive transfer learning to enable tiny LVLMs (<=2B parameters) to effectively serve as automated judges for chart comprehension tasks, addressing performance limitations in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with 7B parameters work well as automated judges for chart tasks, but tiny models (<=2B) perform poorly, limiting their practical use in resource-constrained environments where computational efficiency is crucial.

Method: Two approaches: (1) multi-criteria prompting that combines separate evaluation criteria into single queries, and (2) domain-adaptive transfer learning where a 2B-parameter LVLM is fine-tuned on synthetic judgments from chart datasets to create ChartJudge.

Result: Multi-criteria prompting revealed robustness gaps causing significant performance drops in 7B models including specialized judges like LLaVA-Critic. The tiny ChartJudge model effectively transferred knowledge across datasets and became more specialized. Fine-grained analysis provided insights on trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and transferability.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning tasks by making tiny LVLMs viable as automated judges, with actionable insights for balancing model size, prompt design, and transfer learning approaches.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

*Junyi Zhu,Savas Ozkan,Andrea Maracani,Sinan Mutlu,Cho Jung Min,Mete Ozay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-task pre-finetuning framework using task-primary LoRA modules to enable a single shared encoder backbone with modular adapters for mobile NLP applications, addressing conflicting optimization signals in naive multi-task approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deploy NLP models on mobile platforms that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining efficient in memory and computation, requiring enhanced adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders.

Method: A multi-task pre-finetuning framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, enabling a single shared encoder backbone with modular adapters to avoid conflicting optimization signals.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to individual pre-finetuning with average improvements of +0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification across 21 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enables versatile mobile NLP applications by maintaining performance while meeting practical deployment constraints through modular adapter-based architecture.

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Computational analysis reveals COVID-19 misinformation uses complex language with high emotional persuasion, contrasting with factual content and other health topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify linguistic patterns that distinguish health misinformation from factual communication in online pandemic discourse.

Method: Computational linguistic analysis of three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives (7,588 posts), general COVID-19 content (10,700 posts), and Monkeypox-related posts (5,787 posts), examining readability, rhetorical markers, and persuasive language.

Result: COVID-19 misinformation had significantly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of fear-related/persuasive terms compared to other datasets. It showed minimal exclamation mark use, contrasting with more emotive Monkeypox content.

Conclusion: Misinformation employs deliberately complex rhetorical style with emotional cues that may enhance perceived credibility. Findings provide linguistic indicators for detection and inform public health messaging strategies, though limitations include reliance on traditional readability indices and static analysis.

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Richard Sproat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system using LLMs to develop constructed languages through modular steps: phonology creation, sentence translation to morphosyntactic markup, lexicon construction, orthography design, and grammar handbook generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create fun tools for constructing artificial languages and explore LLMs' understanding of linguistic concepts, including their ability to handle different language patterns and potential applications in low-resource language translation.

Method: Modular approach with agentic phonology creation using feedback, translation of sentences to morphosyntactic markup, lexicon construction from phonological model and morphemes, orthography design using existing scripts, and grammar handbook generation.

Result: System successfully creates constructed languages but shows varying capabilities across different LLMs and linguistic specifications, with better performance on common patterns than rare ones. Limited success in high-to-low resource language translation.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates LLMs' potential in language construction while revealing gaps in their linguistic knowledge, particularly with rare patterns. Future improvements could enhance performance in low-resource language translation tasks.

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

### [18] [Vocabulary embeddings organize linguistic structure early in language model training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07613)
*Isabel Papadimitriou,Jacob Prince*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how LLM vocabulary embeddings evolve during training, finding they quickly converge to semantic/syntactic structure with frequency and function words stabilizing faster than lexical words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how input vocabulary representations in LLMs are structured and evolve during training, particularly how geometric structure correlates with linguistic features.

Method: Used representational similarity analysis on Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B models, correlating embedding geometry with semantic, syntactic, and frequency metrics throughout training.

Result: 1) Vocabulary embeddings quickly converge to high correlations with semantic/syntactic features; 2) High-frequency/function words converge faster than lexical/low-frequency words which retain initialization bias.

Conclusion: Vocabulary embeddings organize around linguistic structure with distinct roles for word frequency and function, motivating deeper study of how geometry evolution facilitates capability gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

### [19] [Toward Reliable Clinical Coding with Language Models: Verification and Lightweight Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07629)
*Zhangdie Yuan,Han-Chin Shing,Mitch Strong,Chaitanya Shivade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with clinical coding accuracy, particularly with hierarchical near-miss errors. Lightweight interventions like prompt engineering and fine-tuning improve performance, and clinical code verification is introduced as a key solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate clinical coding is crucial for healthcare documentation, billing, and decision-making, but existing LLMs perform poorly on this task and current evaluations overlook hierarchical near-miss errors.

Method: Used lightweight interventions including prompt engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, introduced clinical code verification as a standalone task and pipeline component, and created an expert-annotated outpatient benchmark to address dataset limitations.

Result: Hierarchical misalignments account for substantial LLM failures, and verification proves effective for improving LLM-based medical coding accuracy without computational overhead.

Conclusion: Clinical code verification is an effective and reliable approach to enhance LLM-based medical coding, addressing hierarchical near-miss errors that traditional exact match metrics overlook.

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

*Đorđe Klisura,Joseph Khoury,Ashish Kundu,Ram Krishnan,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies LLM adherence to role-based access control in text-to-SQL tasks, comparing prompting, verification pipelines, and fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often produce unrestricted responses that blur role boundaries, creating security concerns in access-controlled environments.

Method: Created a novel dataset extending Spider and BIRD with PostgreSQL role-based policies, then compared three approaches: prompting, two-step generator-verifier pipeline, and LoRA fine-tuned models.

Result: Explicit verification improved refusal precision and reduced false permits, while fine-tuning achieved better balance between safety and utility. Complex policies reduced reliability across all systems.

Conclusion: Verification pipelines and fine-tuning can improve LLM adherence to access control policies, though policy complexity remains a challenge.

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

TL;DR: Ryt AI is the first regulator-approved conversational AI framework that serves as the primary banking interface, enabling customers to execute core financial transactions through natural language instead of traditional multi-screen workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a conversational AI system that can reliably handle core banking transactions under strict regulatory compliance, moving beyond limited advisory/support roles to become the primary banking interface.

Method: Built entirely in-house using ILMU (closed-source LLM) with four specialized LLM-powered agents (Guardrails, Intent, Payment, FAQ) using task-specific LoRA adapters, hosted within bank infrastructure with deterministic guardrails, human-in-the-loop confirmation, and stateless audit architecture.

Result: Successfully deployed as the first global regulator-approved conversational AI banking interface that reliably supports core financial operations under strict governance.

Conclusion: Natural-language interfaces can serve as reliable primary banking interfaces for core financial transactions when built with proper security, compliance, and governance frameworks.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

### [22] [OBCache: Optimal Brain KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07651)
*Yuzhe Gu,Xiyu Liang,Jiaojiao Zhao,Enmao Diao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache is a principled framework for KV cache eviction that formulates it as structured pruning, using output-aware saliency scores derived from Optimal Brain Damage theory to improve long-context accuracy in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cache eviction methods use heuristic token ranking based on accumulated attention weights without considering their actual impact on attention outputs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Formulates cache eviction as layer-wise structured pruning, derives closed-form saliency scores for tokens by measuring perturbation in attention outputs when pruning tokens, considering isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models show that replacing heuristic scores with OBCache's output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

Conclusion: OBCache provides a principled, output-aware approach to KV cache eviction that outperforms existing heuristic methods by better quantifying token saliency's true impact on attention outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

### [23] [Textual Entailment and Token Probability as Bias Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07662)
*Virginia K. Felkner,Allison Lim,Jonathan May*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLI and token probability metrics for measuring social bias in language models show very low correlation and different behaviors, with NLI detecting more "underdebiased" cases but being more brittle to wording changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token probability metrics for bias measurement are criticized for being distant from real-world language model use cases and harms, so the authors test natural language inference as a more realistic alternative bias metric.

Method: The study compares natural language inference (NLI) metrics with token probability (TP) metrics for measuring social bias in language models, examining their correlation and behavioral differences.

Result: NLI and TP bias evaluation behave substantially differently with very low correlation. NLI metrics detect more "underdebiased" cases but are more brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP approaches.

Conclusion: Neither token probability nor natural language inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases. The authors recommend a combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations for comprehensive language model evaluation.

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

*Jifan Zhang,Henry Sleight,Andi Peng,John Schulman,Esin Durmus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic methodology for stress-testing AI model specifications that identifies principle contradictions and ambiguities through value tradeoff scenarios, revealing significant behavioral divergence across frontier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI constitutions and model specifications face challenges with internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced scenarios, requiring systematic testing to identify specification problems.

Method: Generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where models must choose between competing legitimate principles, evaluate responses from 12 frontier LLMs across major providers, and measure behavioral disagreement through value classification scores.

Result: Identified over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence, which strongly predicts underlying problems in model specifications. Found direct contradictions, interpretive ambiguities, misalignment cases, and false-positive refusals across all studied models.

Conclusion: The stress-testing methodology effectively reveals specification problems, and the high behavioral divergence serves as a strong indicator of underlying issues in current model specifications, providing insights for improving AI constitutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are transforming cellular biology by enabling computational systems that represent, predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors, creating 'virtual cells'.

Method: Proposes a unified taxonomy organizing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles (direct cellular modeling) and LLMs as Agents (orchestrating complex scientific tasks). Identifies three core tasks: cellular representation, perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference.

Result: Provides comprehensive review of models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, and critical challenges in the field of LLM-based virtual cell modeling.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a framework for understanding and advancing LLM applications in cellular biology, while highlighting key challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability that need to be addressed.

*Chengshuai Zhao,Shu Wan,Paras Sheth,Karan Patwa,K. Selçuk Candan,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CADET is a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors to improve detection of implicit hate speech by isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hate speech detection models fail to generalize across diverse stylistic variations and are challenged by implicit hate speech conveyed through sarcasm, irony, stereotypes, or coded language, which creates spurious correlations between platform-specific styles and labels.

Method: Models hate speech generation as a causal graph involving contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Uses causal representation learning to disentangle hate speech into interpretable latent factors and control confounders, enabling counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style in the latent space.

Result: CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, showing improved detection of hate speech across varying forms and styles.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection by robustly identifying hate intent independent of superficial linguistic variations.

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

*Shuo Yu,Mingyue Cheng,Daoyu Wang,Qi Liu,Zirui Liu,Ze Guo,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemWeaver is a framework that creates hierarchical memory from user textual history to enable deep personalization in LLMs by capturing temporal evolution and semantic relationships of user interests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat user history as flat text lists, failing to model temporal and semantic structures that reflect dynamic user interests, missing opportunities for deeper personalization.

Method: Builds two complementary memory components: behavioral memory for specific user actions and cognitive memory for long-term preferences, both integrating temporal and semantic information at different abstraction levels.

Result: Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver framework.

Conclusion: MemWeaver successfully weaves user textual history into hierarchical memory that captures both temporal evolution and semantic relationships, enabling LLMs to reason over both concrete behaviors and abstract traits for deep personalization.

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

TL;DR: SubQRAG enhances Graph RAG by decomposing complex questions into verifiable sub-questions, dynamically expanding the knowledge graph when needed, and creating structured graph memory for traceable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Graph RAG lacks deep structured reasoning for complex multi-hop QA, leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation.

Method: Decomposes questions into ordered sub-questions, retrieves triples from graph, dynamically expands graph when insufficient, and aggregates triples into graph memory for traceable evidence.

Result: Achieves consistent and significant improvements on three multi-hop QA benchmarks, especially in Exact Match scores.

Conclusion: SubQRAG effectively enhances reasoning depth in multi-hop QA through sub-question decomposition and dynamic graph expansion.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Result: Achieved improvements of 5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics respectively compared to SOTA MKGC method on 5-language dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages multilingual shared knowledge and reveals properties of knowledge sharing in unseen and unbalanced language settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

*Fu Chen,Peng Wang,Xiyin Li,Wen Li,Shichi Lei,Dongdong Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolExpander is a novel framework that addresses training instability and performance issues in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for LLMs through dynamic hard sampling and self-exemplifying thinking mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO training for LLMs often fails to produce accurate responses, especially in small-scale models, leading to mid-training collapse and diminished performance improvements.

Method: ToolExpander introduces: (1) Dynamic Multi-Round Hard Sampling that replaces challenging samples with few-shot demonstrations, and (2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking that removes KL divergence and adds minimal reward for autonomous example generation.

Result: ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in LLMs, particularly in weaker small-scale models, improving both training stability and overall performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses GRPO's limitations and advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for resource-constrained LLMs.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

*Tianci Liu,Ran Xu,Tony Yu,Ilgee Hong,Carl Yang,Tuo Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenRubrics introduces a large-scale dataset of (prompt, rubric) pairs and Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG) method to create reliable, multi-dimensional reward models that outperform traditional scalar/pairwise approaches by 6.8% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models rely on scalar or pairwise judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences, creating a need for more comprehensive evaluation signals.

Method: Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG) derives both hard rules and implicit principles by contrasting preferred and rejected responses, with reliability improved through preference-label consistency enforcement via rejection sampling.

Result: Rubric-RM surpasses strong size-matched baselines by 6.8% across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, with gains transferring to policy models on instruction-following and biomedical tasks.

Conclusion: Rubrics provide scalable alignment signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

*Runyang You,Yongqi Li,Meng Liu,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper enables parallel test-time scaling for latent reasoning models by introducing stochastic sampling strategies (Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise) and a Latent Reward Model for trajectory aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While parallel test-time scaling works well for explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, it's unclear if latent reasoning models can benefit similarly due to lack of sampling mechanisms in continuous space and probabilistic signals for trajectory aggregation.

Method: Introduces two uncertainty-inspired stochastic sampling strategies (Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise) and designs a Latent Reward Model trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent reasoning trajectories.

Result: Both sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and show distinct exploration dynamics, while the Latent Reward Model enables effective trajectory selection through extensive experiments and visualization analyses.

Conclusion: The work opens a new direction for scalable inference in continuous spaces by enabling parallel test-time scaling for latent reasoning models.

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

*Nishant Balepur,Atrey Desai,Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can solve multiple-choice questions using only choices without questions, and reasoning traces help distinguish between problematic shallow strategies and legitimate inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' success in choices-only MCQA settings represents problematic shallow strategies or legitimate reasoning approaches.

Method: Test LLMs with reasoning on both full and choices-only MCQ inputs, analyze reasoning trace length impact, and apply faithfulness tests to reasoning traces.

Result: Reasoning boosts accuracy in both full and choices-only settings; choices-only success is unaffected by reasoning length; faithful traces show legitimate strategies like inferring missing questions.

Conclusion: Partial-input success in MCQA is not always problematic - reasoning traces can help distinguish between shallow shortcuts and legitimate reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a systematic approach to automatically refactor unstructured tool collections into structured libraries by clustering tools into semantic topics and using multi-agent framework to consolidate functionalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability bottleneck in tool-augmented reasoning caused by growing unstructured tool collections, which leads to retrieval challenges and ambiguity.

Method: Clusters generated tools into semantic topics, then uses multi-agent framework (code agent refactors code to extract shared logic, reviewing agent ensures functional completeness) to consolidate scattered functionalities into aggregated tools.

Result: Significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning performance across multiple reasoning tasks, with enhanced scalability as tool count increases.

Conclusion: Systematic tool refactoring approach effectively transforms numerous question-specific tools into smaller set of powerful aggregated tools without functionality loss, solving scalability issues in tool-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies that outcome-based rewards in math reasoning models lead to reward hacking and false positives, and introduces a process-oriented Rubric Reward Model (RRM) that evaluates reasoning trajectories to improve reliability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models for mathematical reasoning use outcome-based rewards that only credit final answers, making them susceptible to reward hacking and overestimation of reasoning ability due to false positives from unsound reasoning processes.

Method: The authors introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics, providing fine-grained calibrated rewards (0-1) that penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction.

Result: RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks, boosting Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reducing the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%.

Conclusion: Rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models that are not only more accurate but also more reliable, as demonstrated by the significant improvements achieved with the process-oriented RRM approach.

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

*Omar Mahmoud,Ali Khalil,Buddhika Laknath Semage,Thommen George Karimpanal,Santu Rana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the trade-off between truthfulness and safety in LLMs, showing that improving factual accuracy can weaken refusal behavior. The authors propose a method using sparse autoencoders and subspace orthogonalization to maintain safety alignment while reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked side effect where enhancing truthfulness in LLMs negatively impacts safety alignment, as increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior.

Method: Proposes disentangling refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization.

Result: The approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment, preserving refusal behavior and task utility on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject).

Conclusion: The method successfully mitigates the trade-off between truthfulness and safety in LLMs by maintaining refusal behavior while improving factual accuracy.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end multi-label joint learning method for few-shot multi-label intent detection that uses instance relation learning with label knowledge propagation to eliminate error propagation from traditional two-stage approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous two-stage pipeline methods for few-shot multi-label intent detection rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations, leading to error propagation that affects performance.

Method: Constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge propagation to learn interaction relations between instances with class information, propagating label knowledge between support and query sets. Uses dual relation-enhanced loss to optimize support- and query-level relation strength.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end multi-label joint learning method with instance relation learning and label knowledge propagation effectively eliminates error propagation and improves few-shot multi-label intent detection performance.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

*Vardhan Dongre,Ryan A. Rossi,Viet Dac Lai,David Seunghyun Yoon,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Trung Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies context drift in multi-turn LLM interactions, formalizing it as KL divergence between model predictions and proposing a dynamical framework that shows drift reaches stable equilibria rather than runaway degradation, with simple interventions effectively controlling it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM deployments require sustained multi-turn interactions where context drift - gradual divergence from goal-consistent behavior - poses a major challenge that static evaluation metrics fail to capture.

Method: Formalizes drift as turn-wise KL divergence between test model and reference model predictions, proposes a recurrence model interpreting drift as bounded stochastic process with restoring forces, and tests framework on synthetic rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations.

Result: Experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable equilibrium phenomenon rather than inevitable decay, providing foundation for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

*Shuichiro Haruta,Kazunori Matsumoto,Zhi Li,Yanan Wang,Mori Kurokawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a rotation-constrained compensation method for structured pruning of LLMs that preserves output geometry while reducing errors, combined with variance-aware importance scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured pruning of LLMs with limited calibration data causes output mismatches, and direct least-squares fitting tends to overfit and destructively modify pretrained weights.

Method: Updates pruned parameters under rotation constraint to preserve output geometry, plus variance-aware importance scoring to prioritize dimensions with large variance during pruning.

Result: Applied to LLaMA-7B, shows consistently better perplexity on WikiText-2 and higher accuracy on language understanding benchmarks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively compensates pruning errors while preserving important components in a geometry-preserving manner, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,
generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress
remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and

agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven

*Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Kaiyu He,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiPRAG introduces hierarchical process rewards for agentic RAG to address over-search and under-search inefficiencies by evaluating search decisions on-the-fly and providing fine-grained rewards during RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic RAG systems suffer from suboptimal search behaviors like over-search (retrieving known information) and under-search (missing necessary searches), leading to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Existing RL training methods lack fine-grained control to address these inefficiencies.

Method: HiPRAG decomposes the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete steps and applies a hierarchical reward function that evaluates search necessity on-the-fly, providing additional bonuses based on optimal search/non-search step proportions alongside traditional outcome and format rewards.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models across seven QA benchmarks show average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B), while reducing over-search rate to 2.3% and lowering under-search rate, demonstrating improved search efficiency.

Conclusion: HiPRAG demonstrates the efficacy of optimizing reasoning processes through fine-grained RL control, showing good generalizability across RL algorithms, model families, sizes, and types, highlighting the potential for improving search agent efficiency and optimality.

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

TL;DR: GTD is a generative framework that creates optimal communication topologies for LLM-based multi-agent systems through iterative guided diffusion, balancing performance, cost, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static or hand-crafted communication topologies fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, causing either excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for complex ones.

Method: GTD formulates topology synthesis as an iterative construction process using conditional discrete graph diffusion models, guided by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards for real-time optimization.

Result: GTD generates highly task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies that significantly outperform existing methods in LLM agent collaboration across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The iterative guided synthesis approach enables GTD to better navigate complex design trade-offs and produce optimal communication topologies for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

TL;DR: MGR-CSC is a multilingual generative retrieval framework that addresses cross-lingual identifier misalignment and inflation by unifying semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms and compressing identifier space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative Information Retrieval performs well in monolingual scenarios but faces challenges in multilingual retrieval due to cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation.

Method: Proposes MGR-CSC framework that unifies semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align semantics and compresses identifier space, with dynamic multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval.

Result: Achieves 6.83% improvement on mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k in retrieval accuracy, while reducing document identifiers length by 74.51% and 78.2% respectively.

Conclusion: MGR-CSC effectively addresses cross-lingual alignment issues and enhances decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy in multilingual generative retrieval.

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

### [44] [AdaSwitch: Adaptive Switching Generation for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07842)
*Jingyu Peng,Maolin Wang,Hengyi Cai,Yuchen Li,Kai Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSwitch is a novel knowledge distillation method that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation at token level to improve small language model performance while maintaining training-inference consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models face performance challenges under computational constraints. Existing knowledge distillation methods have trade-offs: off-policy distillation provides high-quality supervision but creates training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency but rely on low-quality student outputs.

Method: AdaSwitch dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation at token level. It allows students to first explore their own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on real-time quality assessment.

Result: Experiments on three datasets with two teacher-student LLM pairs show that AdaSwitch consistently improves accuracy while maintaining acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: AdaSwitch offers a practical and effective method for distilling small language models, simultaneously preserving consistency and maintaining supervision quality.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

TL;DR: Translation Tangles is a framework and dataset for evaluating translation quality and fairness in open-source LLMs, addressing performance gaps and bias amplification across languages and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show uneven translation performance across language families and domains, and can encode/amplify biases from training data, especially problematic for low-resource languages and fairness concerns.

Method: Proposed a unified framework benchmarking 24 bidirectional language pairs across domains using multiple metrics, plus a hybrid bias detection pipeline combining rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and LLM-based validation.

Result: Created a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs, with code and dataset publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Translation Tangles provides comprehensive tools for evaluating LLM translation quality and fairness, addressing critical gaps in current MT evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and

*Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Anhad Mohananey,Alexandra Chronopoulou,Pinelopi Papalampidi,Somit Gupta,Tsendsuren Munkhdalai,Lu Wang,Shyam Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the 'overthinking' problem in LLMs where models engage in unnecessarily long reasoning for simple tasks, identifies two main thinking patterns (Explorer and Late Landing) as root causes, and proposes a utility-based definition for better overthinking management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning models show superior performance but suffer from inefficiency due to overthinking - extensive reasoning for simple queries without accuracy improvements. Current analyses are superficial and fail to understand the underlying causes.

Method: Introduces TRACE, a systematic analyzer that decomposes thought processes into sub-thoughts, infers discourse relationships to construct thought progression graphs, and identifies common thinking patterns for similar queries.

Result: Reveals two major thinking patterns (Explorer and Late Landing) showing that over-verification and over-exploration are primary drivers of overthinking. Long-thinking models are 5-20 times slower on simple tasks with no substantial gains.

Conclusion: Proposes a utility-based definition of overthinking that moves beyond length-based metrics, providing better understanding of LLMs' thought progression and practical guidelines for principled overthinking management.

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CS3-Bench, a code-switching speech-to-speech benchmark that reveals significant performance drops (up to 66%) in existing multimodal models for language alignment. The authors propose data construction and training methods using Chain of Recognition and Keyword Highlighting to improve language alignment capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models show deficiencies in language alignment despite achieving natural monolingual interaction, particularly in code-switching scenarios where multiple languages are mixed.

Method: Proposed CS3-Bench benchmark for evaluating code-switching performance, and developed data construction and training approaches using Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation.

Result: The approach improved knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, increased open-ended understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduced pronunciation errors in the secondary language.

Conclusion: The CS3-Bench benchmark reveals critical language alignment issues in existing models, and the proposed methods effectively address these deficiencies, significantly improving performance in code-switching speech-to-speech interactions.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConG framework uses contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to improve weak-to-strong generalization by reducing noise and biases in weak-model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak-to-strong generalization is limited by noise and biases in weak-model outputs, hindering its practical applicability despite being a promising paradigm for scaling LLMs without human feedback.

Method: Leverages implicit rewards through log-likelihood ratios, connects them to Contrastive Decoding, and proposes ConG framework that uses contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality samples.

Result: Empirical results across different model families show consistent improvements in capability transfer, denoising, and robustness, substantially mitigating limitations of traditional weak-to-strong methods.

Conclusion: ConG demonstrates potential to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provides a promising pathway toward AGI through more reliable capability transfer and improved robustness.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

*Verena Blaschke,Miriam Winkler,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares standard-to-dialect transfer across text models, speech models, and cascaded systems for German dialects, finding speech-only models work best for dialect data while text-only models excel on standard data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialects are primarily spoken but most research focuses on text data, and non-standard spellings cause issues in text processing, so comparing different modalities for dialect processing is needed.

Method: Compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text models, speech models, and cascaded systems (speech transcribed then processed by text models) for German and German dialects using intent and topic classification tasks.

Result: Speech-only setup provides best results on dialect data, text-only setup works best on standard data. Cascaded systems lag behind text-only for German but perform relatively well on dialect data when transcription generates normalized output.

Conclusion: Speech models are most effective for dialect processing, and cascaded systems can be viable for dialects when using normalized transcriptions, highlighting the importance of modality choice for dialectal NLP tasks.

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

TL;DR: MCBench is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly following step-by-step instructions, providing objective and code-verifiable assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frontier LLMs have saturated existing benchmarks, creating a need for more challenging benchmarks that offer objective verification of LLM capabilities beyond subjective judgments.

Method: MCBench uses step-by-step instructions for string-matching NLP metrics, with parallel reference code for objective evaluation. It includes three evaluative metrics and three benchmark variants to measure detailed instruction understanding.

Result: MCBench serves as an effective and objective tool for evaluating cutting-edge LLMs' capabilities in maintaining accurate step-by-step execution, instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range consistency.

Conclusion: The benchmark successfully provides a deterministic, code-verifiable evaluation framework that can systematically test LLMs' instruction-following abilities and computational consistency.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACE is a knowledge editing framework that addresses multi-hop factual recall failures in LLMs by identifying and editing critical query-value neuron pathways discovered through causal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing methods show significant performance decay in multi-hop factual recall, especially when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects in reasoning chains.

Method: ACE uses neuron-level attribution to identify critical query-value pathways where implicit subjects function as query neurons that activate value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information.

Result: ACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B, and reveals fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 with semantic interpretability orchestrated by query-driven accumulation.

Conclusion: The findings establish a new pathway for advancing knowledge editing capabilities based on principled understanding of internal reasoning mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

TL;DR: A unified LLM-enhanced auto-grading framework that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions across various domains, outperforming traditional and LLM-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic grading of subjective questions is challenging due to diverse question formats and open-ended responses. Existing works lack generality for comprehensive exams with diverse question types.

Method: Integrates four complementary modules: basic text matching, LLM-based key knowledge point comparison, pseudo-question generation from student answers to assess relevance, and simulation of human evaluation to identify content-related and non-content strengths/weaknesses.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple grading metrics. Successfully deployed in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce enterprise.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a comprehensive solution for automatic grading of diverse subjective questions with human-like evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods fail to address the need for different reasoning abilities at different steps in multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks, limiting effective knowledge transfer.

Method: StepER employs step-wise supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across stages, and incorporates difficulty-aware training to progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps.

Result: Extensive experiments show StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B teacher model.

Conclusion: StepER effectively enhances reasoning ability in multi-step retrieval-augmented language models through step-wise knowledge distillation and is adaptable to various model architectures.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of incomplete information in LLM outputs and evaluates three automated methods for detecting missing information, finding that simple end-to-end approaches are surprisingly effective but less robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently produce outputs that omit key information, which can cause significant harm in sensitive domains comparable to factual inaccuracies like hallucinations.

Method: Three evaluation strategies: (1) NLI-based method decomposing texts into atomic statements, (2) Q&A-based approach comparing responses across sources, and (3) end-to-end method using LLMs to directly identify missing content.

Result: The simple end-to-end approach demonstrated surprising effectiveness compared to more complex methods, though with reduced robustness, interpretability and result granularity.

Conclusion: End-to-end LLM methods show promise for comprehensiveness evaluation but trade-offs exist in robustness and interpretability compared to more structured approaches.

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can semi-automatically enrich historical Estonian dictionaries, recognize Gothic script text, and help create unified datasets, saving time and resources for minor languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply large language models to study 17th-18th century Estonian dictionaries for enrichment, text recognition, and dataset creation.

Method: Used LLMs for three tasks: enriching historical dictionaries with modern forms/meanings, vision-enabled LLMs for Gothic script recognition, and overlapping tiling for digitizing dictionary sections.

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieved 81% accuracy in providing meanings and modern equivalents; zero-shot method successfully identified 41% of headword entries in JSON format; overlapping tiling method employed for digitization.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic enrichment of historical dictionaries and can save time and financial resources even for minor languages.

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A²Search is an annotation-free training framework that handles ambiguous questions in open-domain QA by automatically detecting ambiguity and gathering alternative answers through trajectory sampling and evidence verification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA models struggle with ambiguous questions that admit multiple valid answers, and standard benchmarks with single gold answers provide inappropriate training signals. Manual annotation for ambiguity is costly and difficult to scale for multi-hop datasets.

Method: Uses an automated pipeline with trajectory sampling and evidence verification to detect ambiguous questions and gather alternative answers. Optimizes the model with RL using a carefully designed AnsF1 reward that accommodates multiple answers.

Result: Achieves new SOTA performance on eight open-domain QA benchmarks. A²Search-7B yields average AnsF1@1 score of 48.4% across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming larger models like ReSearch-32B (46.2%).

Conclusion: Embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems. A²Search effectively resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks without requiring manual annotation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$

### [57] [LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07962)
*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner is a framework where smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language models (LLMs) by identifying high-value reasoning moments through expert-amateur contrast, enabling efficient fine-tuning without ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for LLMs is resource-intensive and inefficient, requiring large datasets and uniform optimization across all tokens despite only some tokens having meaningful learning value.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) sampling stage identifies critical reasoning moments through expert-amateur contrast between LLM and SLM, (2) fine-tuning stage aligns expert model with distilled examples to amplify reasoning strengths.

Result: Achieves up to 28.1% accuracy improvement on seven mathematical benchmarks, while reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token usage by 99% without ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: LightReasoner enables scalable and resource-efficient LLM reasoning advancement by leveraging weaker SLMs as effective teaching signals through behavioral divergence analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

### [58] [Active Confusion Expression in Large Language Models: Leveraging World Models toward Better Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07974)
*Jialu Du,Guiyang Hou,Yihui Fu,Chen Wu,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with social reasoning due to confusion between objective reality and subjective beliefs. The paper proposes a world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that tracks entity states and intervenes when confusion is detected, significantly improving social reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel at mathematical and code reasoning but fail at social reasoning tasks, showing cognitive confusion, logical inconsistencies, and inability to distinguish between objective world states and subjective belief states.

Method: Propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs dynamic textual world models to track entity states and temporal sequences. It monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions.

Result: Evaluations on three social benchmarks show significant accuracy improvements (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational costs by up to 33.8% token reduction.

Conclusion: The world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism offers a simple yet effective solution for deploying LLMs in social contexts by helping models navigate cognitive dilemmas and distinguish between external events and internal beliefs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

*Watcharapong Timklaypachara,Monrada Chiewhawan,Nopporn Lekuthai,Titipat Achakulvisut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage caption generation system that combines contextual filtering with author-specific stylistic refinement to create scientifically accurate and stylistically consistent figure captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific figure captions need both accuracy and stylistic consistency to effectively convey visual information, requiring systems that can understand context and adapt to author-specific writing styles.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 uses context filtering, category-specific prompt optimization (DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA), and caption candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures for stylistic refinement.

Result: Category-specific prompts improved ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3% while limiting precision loss to -2.8% and BLEU-4 reduction to -10.9%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yielded 40-48% gains in BLEU scores and 25-27% in ROUGE.

Conclusion: Combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

TL;DR: MUSE is a novel LLM agent framework that enables continuous learning through experience-driven self-evolution using a hierarchical Memory Module, achieving SOTA performance on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents are test-time static and cannot learn from experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously improve on real-world long-horizon tasks.

Method: MUSE introduces an experience-driven self-evolving system with a hierarchical Memory Module that organizes diverse experience levels, autonomously reflects on trajectories after sub-task execution, and converts raw trajectories into structured experience for integration.

Result: Achieves new SOTA performance on TAC benchmark using lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model, shows increasingly superior task completion with accumulated experience, demonstrates robust continuous learning and self-evolution, and exhibits strong generalization with zero-shot improvement on new tasks.

Conclusion: MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI agents capable of real-world productivity task automation through continuous learning and experience accumulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT shows competitive Japanese-English translation performance compared to commercial systems, with document-level translation outperforming sentence-level, though prompt enhancements showed no clear benefit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities for Japanese-English translation and compare it against commercially available translation engines using both automatic and human evaluation methods.

Method: Used simple and enhanced prompts with ChatGPT, performed document-level and sentence-level translation, and conducted both automatic evaluation and MQM-based human evaluation.

Result: Document-level translation performed better than sentence-level. No clear advantage for enhanced prompts over simple ones. ChatGPT-3.5 preferred in automatic evaluation but ChatGPT-4 had better fluency. ChatGPT showed competitive results against commercial translation systems.

Conclusion: ChatGPT is a viable alternative for Japanese-English translation, with document-level processing being more effective, though there are tradeoffs between different ChatGPT versions in terms of accuracy vs fluency.

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

*Ivan Kuznetsov,Jacopo Grassi,Dmitrii Pantiukhin,Boris Shapkin,Thomas Jung,Nikolay Koldunov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can recall climate normals with reasonable accuracy (3-6°C RMSE) but struggle with spatial patterns of temperature change and high-elevation areas, limiting their ability to assess climate dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' internal climatological knowledge for reliability assessment and misinformation risk evaluation in climate applications.

Method: Constructed global grid queries at 1° resolution for mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020, validated against ERA5 reanalysis, tested with and without geographic context.

Result: LLMs capture basic climate structure with 3-6°C RMSE and ±1°C biases, but show spatially coherent errors in mountains/high latitudes. Performance degrades above 1500m (5-13°C RMSE vs 2-4°C). Geographic context reduces errors by 27%. Models fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change.

Conclusion: While LLMs encode present-day climate distributions, they cannot represent regional/local temperature shifts essential for climate dynamics understanding, highlighting limitations in climate change assessment capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

TL;DR: This survey provides a systematic overview of Process Reward Models (PRMs) that evaluate reasoning at step level rather than just final answers, covering data generation, model building, and applications across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional alignment is dominated by outcome reward models that only judge final answers, creating a gap that PRMs address by evaluating reasoning at the step or trajectory level for more fine-grained guidance.

Method: The survey systematically examines the full PRM loop: process data generation, PRM building, and PRM usage for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents.

Result: The paper summarizes applications across multiple domains and reviews emerging benchmarks for PRMs, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state and design spaces.

Conclusion: The goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment through process-level evaluation.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future
research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

### [64] [FedDTRE: Federated Dialogue Generation Models Powered by Trustworthiness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08058)
*Shule Lu,Lingxiang Wang,Sijia Wen,Ziwei Wang,Hainan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedDTRE is a federated learning method that uses trustworthiness evaluation to dynamically balance global and local model contributions in dialogue generation, addressing overfitting and forgetting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized or local training approaches struggle with privacy-preservation and personalization in dialogue systems. Federated learning helps but existing methods suffer from overfitting with limited client data and forget global information over time, leading to poor generalization.

Method: FedDTRE uses trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's contribution during local updates, rather than directly replacing local models with the global model.

Result: Experimental results show that FedDTRE improves dialogue model performance and enhances the quality of dialogue generation.

Conclusion: FedDTRE effectively addresses overfitting and forgetting problems in federated learning for dialogue systems, leading to better model performance and dialogue quality.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

*Shramay Palta,Peter Rankel,Sarah Wiegreffe,Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human plausibility judgments in commonsense benchmarks are influenced by LLM-generated rationales, with PRO arguments increasing and CON arguments decreasing ratings. LLMs show similar patterns, raising concerns about AI influence on human beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how human plausibility judgments in commonsense reasoning are affected by LLM-generated arguments for or against answers, and whether LLMs exhibit similar influence patterns.

Method: Collected 3,000 human plausibility judgments and 13,600 LLM judgments on multiple-choice commonsense benchmarks, testing responses with and without PRO/CON rationales generated by LLMs.

Result: Human plausibility ratings increased with PRO rationales and decreased with CON rationales, showing humans find LLM arguments convincing. LLMs exhibited similar influence patterns in their own judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly influence human commonsense judgments, demonstrating their potential for studying human cognition while raising concerns about AI's ability to shape human beliefs even in domains where humans are considered experts.

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

*Sherzod Hakimov,Roland Bernard,Tim Leiber,Karl Osswald,Kristina Richert,Ruilin Yang,Raffaella Bernardi,David Schlangen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enabling reasoning in LLMs significantly improves negotiation performance but increases computational costs substantially, with open-weight models showing language switching issues in multilingual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how reasoning affects LLMs' negotiation abilities across different languages and models, examining performance-cost trade-offs and strategic adaptation.

Method: Self-play setup across three diverse dialogue games, analyzing reasoning effects on commercial and open-weight LLMs in three languages (English, German, Italian).

Result: Reasoning improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4% but increases cost by nearly 400%. Open-weight models switch to English for internal reasoning even when negotiating in other languages, while commercial models maintain language consistency.

Conclusion: Reasoning significantly enhances negotiation outcomes but at high computational cost, with important multilingual distinctions in reasoning language consistency between model types.

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

*Daiki Chijiwa,Taku Hasegawa,Kyosuke Nishida,Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Tomoya Ohba,Tamao Sakao,Susumu Takeuchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for lossless vocabulary reduction in auto-regressive language models, enabling conversion to smaller vocabularies without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different language models have unique vocabularies, making it difficult for them to cooperate effectively through methods like model ensemble due to incompatible next-token distributions.

Method: The authors establish a theoretical framework for lossless vocabulary reduction that efficiently converts auto-regressive language models to models with arbitrarily small vocabularies while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The method enables language models with different tokenization schemes to cooperate efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Conclusion: The proposed vocabulary reduction framework facilitates better cooperation between language models with different tokenization approaches without compromising performance.

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

*Haoyang Gui,Thales Bertaglia,Taylor Annabell,Catalina Goanta,Tjomme Dooper,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs (GPT-5-nano and Gemini-2.5-flash-lite) for detecting undisclosed sponsored content on Instagram, comparing performance across different prompting strategies with legal knowledge. While models achieve high accuracy (F1 up to 0.93) on clear cases, performance drops significantly on ambiguous content, and the study identifies common reasoning errors in LLM-generated legal explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The blurring of boundaries between organic and sponsored content in influencer marketing makes legal transparency enforcement challenging. Current detection methods lack legal grounding or operate as opaque black boxes, requiring more legally robust and transparent automated moderation systems.

Method: Used 1,143 Instagram posts to compare two LLMs (GPT-5-nano and Gemini-2.5-flash-lite) under three prompting strategies with controlled legal knowledge. Developed taxonomy of reasoning errors and combined quantitative/qualitative evaluation of LLM explanations annotated by law-trained students.

Result: Both models performed strongly in classifying sponsored content (F1 up to 0.93) but performance dropped over 10 points on ambiguous cases. Common errors included citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references (20.71%), with hidden ads showing highest miscue rate (28.57%). Adding regulatory text improved explanation quality but not consistently improved detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The study advances regulatory compliance technology by providing a taxonomy of LLM legal reasoning errors, enabling evaluation of both accuracy and legal robustness in automated moderation. It offers practical insights for advertising regulatory bodies to automate moderation processes on solid legal foundations.

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

*Jasmina Gajcin,Erik Miehling,Rahul Nair,Elizabeth Daly,Radu Marinescu,Seshu Tirupathi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to extract concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-judge systems to understand their biases and risks, using CLoVE for local explanations and GloVE for global policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used to evaluate text and replace human annotations at scale, it's crucial to understand their potential biases and risks.

Method: Two algorithms: CLoVE generates verifiable, concept-based contrastive local explanations, and GloVE uses iterative clustering, summarization and verification to condense local rules into global policies.

Result: Extracted global policies are highly faithful to LLM-as-a-judge decisions, robust to text perturbations and adversarial attacks, and users showed good understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully extracts interpretable global policies from LLM-as-a-judge systems, providing insights into their decision-making processes and biases.

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Genii is an unsupervised multi-agent framework that reduces judgment preference bias in LLM-based evaluators through collaborative polling optimization, outperforming supervised models without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based evaluators often exhibit bias by favoring their own generated responses, which undermines the reliability of their judgments in LLM-as-a-Judge applications.

Method: Genii integrates multiple LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates interactive client-server polling to optimize each client agent unsupervisedly without human-labeled data.

Result: Experiments show Genii outperforms supervised models trained on annotated data, improves performance across different client agents during polling, and effectively mitigates judgment preference bias even with weaker server agents.

Conclusion: Genii provides an effective unsupervised approach to reduce judgment bias in LLM evaluators, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various model configurations without requiring human annotations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI Knowledge Assist automatically builds knowledge bases from customer-agent conversations using QA pairs, enabling immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots in contact centers without cold-start issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of company-specific knowledge bases is a major barrier to integrating conversational AI systems in contact centers, creating a need for automated knowledge extraction from existing conversations.

Method: Extracts QA pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to build knowledge bases automatically, then fine-tunes lightweight LLM (LLaMA-3.1-8B) on internal data.

Result: Achieves above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions across 20 companies, eliminating cold-start gap and outperforming larger closed-source LLMs.

Conclusion: The system enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots in contact centers by automatically creating knowledge bases from existing conversation data.

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

*Elena Khasanova,Harsh Saini,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Xue-Yong Fu,Cheng Chen,Shashi Bhushan TN*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DACIP-RC is a continual pre-training method that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for business conversational tasks using reading comprehension on conversation transcripts instead of traditional next-token prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following capabilities across diverse domains, and traditional fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting adaptability to dynamic user requirements in industrial settings.

Method: Generates diverse task instructions and responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling better instruction generalization through continual pre-training.

Result: Significantly improves zero-shot generalization across business conversational tasks including meeting summarization, action item generation, and call purpose identification.

Conclusion: First work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational data, providing insights for industries to leverage proprietary datasets for domain adaptation.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

*Shuzhou Yuan,Ercong Nie,Yinuo Sun,Chenxuan Zhao,William LaCroix,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces benchmarks to identify false refusals in LLMs and proposes lightweight mitigation strategies without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently produce false refusals to benign requests containing terms resembling unsafe queries, limiting their helpfulness.

Method: Created XSB and MS-XSB benchmarks to evaluate refusal behavior, then used post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deployed three model-agnostic approaches: ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering.

Result: Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models showed substantial improvement in compliance on safe prompts while maintaining safety protections.

Conclusion: Establishes a reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals, providing practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

TL;DR: ARM2 is a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through reinforcement learning with length-aware optimization, reducing token usage by over 70% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models suffer from 'over-thinking' - generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Existing solutions like length penalties or routing mechanisms are heuristic and task-specific, lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning.

Method: ARM2 uses a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. It integrates vision understanding for multimodal applications and incorporates executable code into reasoning to reduce token costs while preserving performance.

Result: ARM2 achieves performance on par with traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by over 70% on average. Extensive analyses validate the effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Conclusion: ARM2 provides a unified solution for adaptive reasoning that significantly improves efficiency while maintaining performance across multiple reasoning formats, including natural language inference, vision understanding, and executable code integration.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetricalARGS is a taxonomy for evaluating LLMs on metrical poetry tasks across Analysis, Retrieval, Generation, and Support dimensions, using Telugu poetry as an example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe deeper reasoning and language understanding in LLMs through metrical poetry, which enforces strict syllable and phoneme constraints, going beyond previous NLP work focused mainly on generation and summarization.

Method: Introduces MetricalARGS taxonomy with four task dimensions (Analysis, Retrieval, Generation, Support), discusses dataset and evaluation considerations, and demonstrates application using Telugu poetry.

Result: The paper presents the first comprehensive taxonomy for evaluating LLMs on metrical poetry tasks, providing a framework to assess capabilities in following strict poetic constraints.

Conclusion: MetricalARGS offers a systematic approach to understand LLM capabilities and limitations through metrical poetry, highlighting broader possibilities for evaluating advanced reasoning in language models.

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training-Free GRPO enhances LLM agent performance without parameter updates by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, using group relative semantic advantages in rollout groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle in specialized domains due to ineffective tool integration and prompting, while existing methods require costly parameter updates through SFT and RL phases.

Method: Proposes Training-Free GRPO that leverages group relative semantic advantages instead of numerical ones, distilling high-quality experiential knowledge as token prior during multi-epoch learning with minimal ground-truth data.

Result: Applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks, outperforming fine-tuned small LLMs with minimal training data and cost.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO provides a cost-effective solution that avoids parameter updates and overfitting while enhancing LLM agent performance through learned token priors.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

### [77] [Memory Retrieval and Consolidation in Large Language Models through Function Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08203)
*Shaohua Zhang,Yuan Lin,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the function token hypothesis to explain how LLMs work: function tokens activate predictive features for memory retrieval during inference and drive memory consolidation during pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in LLMs, which remain poorly understood despite their remarkable success.

Method: Proposed function token hypothesis, conducted bipartite graph analysis to show feature activation patterns, and performed case studies to examine how function tokens activate predictive features.

Result: Function tokens activate the majority of features, and during pre-training, training loss is dominated by predicting content tokens following function tokens, forcing function tokens to select the most predictive features.

Conclusion: The function token hypothesis provides a framework for understanding LLM mechanisms, with function words playing crucial roles in both memory retrieval and consolidation processes.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

*XuHao Hu,Peng Wang,Xiaoya Lu,Dongrui Liu,Xuanjing Huang,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs finetuned on malicious data can become broadly misaligned to exhibit dishonest and deceptive behaviors in high-stakes scenarios, even with minimal misalignment data or biased user interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether emergent misalignment extends beyond safety behaviors to dishonesty and deception in high-stakes scenarios, building on previous research showing LLMs can become broadly misaligned from narrow-domain finetuning.

Method: Finetuned open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains, tested in downstream combined finetuning settings with minimal misalignment data, and simulated human-AI interactions with both benign and biased users.

Result: LLMs showed broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty; 1% misalignment data decreased honest behavior by over 20%; 10% biased user population unintentionally exacerbated dishonesty in assistant LLMs.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment extends to dishonesty and deception in high-stakes scenarios, and this risk arises through direct finetuning, downstream mixture tasks, and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

TL;DR: SenWave is a fine-grained multi-language sentiment analysis dataset for COVID-19 tweets with 10 sentiment categories across 5 languages, enabling detailed emotional landscape analysis during the pandemic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing COVID-19 datasets that have coarse-grained sentiment labels and lack labeled data, despite the availability of large volumes of COVID-19 data.

Method: Created a dataset with 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, plus 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian. Fine-tuned pre-trained transformer models for sentiment classification and evaluated compatibility with ChatGPT.

Result: Successfully developed a comprehensive sentiment analysis dataset and provided in-depth analysis of emotional evolution across languages, countries, and topics during COVID-19 waves. Demonstrated dataset robustness and versatility.

Conclusion: SenWave dataset enables fine-grained sentiment analysis for complex events, fostering more nuanced understanding and research innovations in NLP, with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

*Tim Hagen,Niklas Deckers,Felix Wolter,Harrisen Scells,Martin Potthast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the neglect of counterclaims in causality extraction by creating a new dataset that includes concausal (refuting) statements alongside procausal (supporting) ones, showing that models trained without concausal data misclassify them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causality extraction datasets focus only on procausal claims and ignore concausal claims, which are important for causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge.

Method: Developed a new dataset by augmenting the Causal News Corpus with concausal statements using rigorous annotation guidelines, achieving high inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's κ=0.74).

Result: Models trained without concausal relationships tend to misclassify them as procausal. The new dataset enables transformers to effectively distinguish between pro- and concausality.

Conclusion: Integrating concausal statements is crucial for accurate causality extraction, and the new dataset successfully addresses this gap in existing research.

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that trains conversation and feedback agents collaboratively to improve LLM safety alignment, reducing both unsafe responses and overrefusals while preserving helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety approaches often completely reject unsafe content, which exacerbates overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance. There's a fundamental tension between vulnerability to adversarial attacks and tendency for overrefusal on benign sensitive prompts.

Method: WaltzRL uses multi-agent reinforcement learning with a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves based on how well the conversation agent incorporates feedback. The feedback agent provides suggestions to improve safety and helpfulness, and both agents are deployed together with adaptive engagement.

Result: Significantly reduces unsafe responses (from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench) across five diverse datasets compared to various baselines.

Conclusion: WaltzRL enables conversation and feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, enhancing LLM safety without degrading general capabilities and advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

*Jannek Ulm,Kevin Du,Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training LLMs on synthetic data generated via contrastive decoding improves performance on language modeling and downstream tasks, especially reasoning-heavy tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about limited training data for LLMs by exploring synthetic data generation as a solution to data scarcity.

Method: Use contrastive decoding to generate synthetic corpora by sampling from the difference between good and bad models trained on the same 100M word corpus, then mix synthetic data with original training data.

Result: Training on mixed synthetic and real data improves language modeling performance and downstream task performance. Contrastive decoding synthetic data particularly benefits reasoning tasks, while traditional sampling helps surface-level linguistic tasks.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation, especially using contrastive decoding, is a viable approach to enhance LLM training and performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner is a novel framework that enhances multi-turn reasoning in AI agents through high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context window management, achieving significant performance improvements on search agent benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning models struggle with deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon interactions, needing better methods to handle continuously expanding contexts and complex reasoning scenarios.

Method: Uses reverse construction to generate complex verifiable question-answer pairs from web sources, dynamic context management with sliding windows, and reinforcement learning on Qwen3-32B to develop DeepMiner-32B.

Result: Achieves 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en (20 percentage points improvement over previous best), consistent improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA, and enables sustained 100-turn interactions within 32k context length.

Conclusion: DeepMiner effectively addresses context limitations in multi-turn interaction systems and demonstrates substantial performance gains through its novel training and context management approaches.

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neuron-level analysis reveals culture-general and culture-specific neurons in LLMs, concentrated in shallow-middle MLP layers. Suppressing these neurons degrades cultural understanding while preserving general NLU performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, with underexplored internal mechanisms for cultural understanding.

Method: Gradient-based scoring method with filtering to identify culture-general and culture-specific neurons, followed by suppression experiments and training analysis.

Result: Identified <1% of neurons drive cultural behavior; suppressing them degrades cultural benchmarks by up to 30% while NLU performance remains unaffected; culture-specific neurons support related cultures; NLU training can diminish cultural understanding.

Conclusion: Provides insights into LLMs' internal mechanisms and practical guidance for model training to improve cultural understanding while maintaining general capabilities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

### [85] [AutoRed: A Free-form Adversarial Prompt Generation Framework for Automated Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08329)
*Muxi Diao,Yutao Mou,Keqing He,Hanbo Song,Lulu Zhao,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRed is a free-form adversarial prompt generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions, using persona-guided generation and reflection loops to create diverse adversarial prompts for LLM safety testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red teaming methods rely on seed instructions, which limits semantic diversity of adversarial prompts. There's a need for more effective methods to evaluate LLM safety without this limitation.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation, and (2) reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. Includes a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without querying target models.

Result: Built AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard datasets. Achieved higher attack success rates and better generalization than existing baselines when evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates limitations of seed-based approaches and shows potential of free-form red teaming for LLM safety evaluation. Will open source datasets.

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

### [86] [Two-Stage Voting for Robust and Efficient Suicide Risk Detection on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08365)
*Yukai Song,Pengfei Zhou,César Escobar-Viera,Candice Biernesser,Wei Huang,Jingtong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage voting architecture for suicide risk detection that uses BERT for explicit cases and LLM voting/ML ensemble for implicit cases, achieving high performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide rates are rising globally, and social media provides valuable signals as at-risk individuals often share distress online. However, detecting implicit suicidal ideation conveyed through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle cues remains challenging for existing models.

Method: Two-stage architecture: Stage 1 uses lightweight BERT for high-confidence explicit cases; Stage 2 escalates ambiguous inputs to either (i) multi-perspective LLM voting framework for implicit cases, or (ii) feature-based ML ensemble using psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs.

Result: Outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7% on implicit cases, reducing cross-domain gap below 2%, while significantly lowering LLM computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances efficiency and robustness for suicide risk detection, being among the first to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as structured vectors for this task.

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

### [87] [On the Relationship Between the Choice of Representation and In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08372)
*Ioana Marinescu,Kyunghyun Cho,Eric Karl Oermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In-context learning (ICL) in LLMs has two independent components: representation quality (label sets) determines baseline accuracy, while learning from additional demonstrations improves performance regardless of representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the interaction between representation (how demonstrations are presented) and learning capacity (performance improvement from more demonstrations) in ICL, which has not been studied in depth.

Method: Developed an optimization algorithm to enumerate label sets varying in semantic relevance, then performed ICL with varying numbers of demonstrations for each label set to analyze learning patterns.

Result: Learning occurs regardless of label set quality, but learning efficiency depends on both label set quality and model size. The relative quality of label sets is maintained throughout learning, confirming their independence from learning effects.

Conclusion: Representation and learning in ICL are largely orthogonal - representation determines baseline performance while learning improves on top of this baseline, revealing previously underexplored independent effects in ICL.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

### [88] [If Probable, Then Acceptable? Understanding Conditional Acceptability Judgments in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08388)
*Jasmin Orth,Philipp Mondorf,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) judge the acceptability of conditional statements, examining their sensitivity to conditional probability and semantic relevance across different model architectures and sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional acceptability is crucial for communication and reasoning, but while prior work studied LLMs' inferences about conditionals, it's unclear how they judge acceptability. The study aims to fill this gap by comprehensively analyzing LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments.

Method: The researchers conducted a comprehensive study using linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests to analyze LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies.

Result: LLMs are sensitive to both conditional probability and semantic relevance, though sensitivity varies by architecture and prompting style. Larger models don't necessarily align more closely with human judgments, and LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues less consistently than humans.

Conclusion: While LLMs can process conditional acceptability using similar cues as humans, they do so with less consistency, and model size doesn't guarantee better alignment with human judgment patterns.

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

*Noor Ul Zain,Mohsin Raza,Ahsan Adeel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A tiny Co⁴ model with only 8M parameters and O(N) complexity outperforms much larger GPT-2 (124M) and GPT-BERT (30M) models with O(N²) complexity on BabyLM benchmarks, achieving superior training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge prevailing deep learning paradigms and scaling laws by demonstrating that smaller, more efficient models can outperform larger, more complex ones.

Method: Developed Co⁴ - a single-layer, two-head transformer with 8M parameters and O(N) computational complexity, trained on 10M tokens for just 2 epochs compared to 10 epochs for baseline models.

Result: Co⁴ outperformed GPT-2 on 5/7 zero-shot metrics and 6/7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4/7 metrics in both cases, while being orders-of-magnitude more training efficient.

Conclusion: Results suggest the need to rethink current deep learning paradigms and scaling laws, as smaller, more efficient models can achieve superior performance to larger, more complex alternatives.

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

*Shuang Chen,Yue Guo,Yimeng Ye,Shijue Huang,Wenbo Hu,Haoxi Li,Manyuan Zhang,Jiayu Chen,Song Guo,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARES is a framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty, using high window-entropy tokens to identify reasoning-critical moments and optimizing exploration through a two-stage training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large reasoning models tend to overthink simple problems (producing lengthy reasoning traces) while under-exploring challenging ones (missing solutions), creating an imbalance in reasoning effort allocation.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Adaptive Cold-Start with difficulty-proportional reasoning traces, 2) Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization using high window-entropy tokens as exploration triggers and hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control.

Result: ARES achieves superior performance and reasoning efficiency across mathematical, logical, and multimodal benchmarks, closing the gap to commercial systems with significantly lower inference costs.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive reasoning framework effectively balances exploration effort based on task difficulty, improving both performance and efficiency in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The LEWIDI shared task series promotes training AI models to recognize human judgment variation and disagreement. The third edition extends the benchmark to four datasets with both categorical and ordinal judgments, using soft-label and perspectivist evaluation paradigms with new metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models should be trained to be aware of variation and disagreement in human judgments, and evaluated on their ability to recognize such variation.

Method: Extended LEWIDI benchmark to four datasets (paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm detection, natural language inference) with categorical and ordinal judgments. Used two evaluation paradigms: soft-label (predicting population-level distributions) and perspectivist (predicting individual annotator interpretations) with new metrics beyond standard cross-entropy.

Result: The task attracted diverse participation and provided insights into strengths and limitations of methods for modeling variation. Results strengthened LEWIDI as a framework and provided new resources, benchmarks, and findings.

Conclusion: The contributions support the development of disagreement-aware technologies by providing comprehensive evaluation methods and datasets that capture human judgment variation.

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

*Shangqing Tu,Yaxuan Li,Yushi Bai,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepPrune is a framework that reduces computational redundancy in parallel Chain-of-Thought reasoning by dynamically pruning identical reasoning traces, achieving 80% token reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallel scaling in LLMs generates multiple reasoning traces simultaneously, but over 80% of these traces yield identical final answers, representing significant computational waste due to inter-trace redundancy.

Method: DeepPrune uses a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling to predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces (0.87 AUROC), combined with an online greedy clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving answer diversity.

Result: Across three benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, GPQA), DeepPrune achieves over 80% token reduction compared to conventional consensus sampling while maintaining accuracy within 3 percentage points.

Conclusion: DeepPrune establishes a new standard for efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning significantly more efficient by addressing the critical computational inefficiency bottleneck in parallel scaling approaches.

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

*John Hewitt,Oyvind Tafjord,Robert Geirhos,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing new words (neologisms) to LLMs enables better understanding and control of model concepts through self-verbalization and plug-in evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans create new words for emerging concepts, and similar approach can help understand and control LLMs by introducing new word embeddings.

Method: Add new word embeddings and train with concept examples, then use self-verbalization to describe meanings and plug-in evaluation to validate control.

Result: Neologisms successfully control concepts like flattery, incorrect answers, text length, and complex AxBench concepts. Models can self-verbalize meanings and reveal machine-only synonyms.

Conclusion: Neologism learning provides effective method for understanding and controlling LLMs, enabling joint learning of multiple concepts through multiple new words.

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

TL;DR: A framework combining Monte Carlo Tree Search with a proxy evaluator for efficient prompt optimization in fairness detection of ToS clauses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods are computationally expensive due to inefficient search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring, particularly challenging for legal NLP tasks like fairness detection in ToS clauses.

Method: Proposes a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy prompt evaluator to effectively explore the prompt space while reducing evaluation costs.

Result: Experiments show the approach achieves higher classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under constrained computation budget.

Conclusion: The proposed MCTS with proxy evaluator framework provides an effective and efficient solution for prompt optimization in challenging legal NLP tasks.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

### [95] [Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525)
*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLKV uses reinforcement learning to identify reasoning-critical attention heads in LLMs, then applies selective KV cache compression to achieve 20-50% cache reduction with near lossless performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods perform poorly on reasoning models - token-dropping breaks reasoning integrity and head-reallocating compresses reasoning-critical heads, causing significant performance degradation.

Method: Proposed RLKV framework uses reinforcement learning to optimize the relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality, identifying reasoning-critical heads through actual generated samples during training.

Result: Only a small fraction of attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling 20-50% KV cache reduction with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

Conclusion: RLKV effectively identifies reasoning-critical heads and achieves efficient KV cache compression for reasoning models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS enables LLM-based agents to self-evolve through mutual discussion and collaboration, generating intrinsic rewards from interactions and optimizing policies via RL without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based self-evolution methods rely on external rewards or simple intrinsic signals, diverging from human-like learning through discussion and collaboration.

Method: Co-evolving Multi-Agent Systems framework with intrinsic rewards from discussion dynamics, LLM-as-a-judge mechanism, and RL policy optimization for decentralized co-evolution.

Result: CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings, showing promising scalability with increasing agent numbers and diversity.

Conclusion: CoMAS establishes a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents through interaction-based learning.

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher is a framework that automatically evolves benchmarks to address data leakage issues in LLM evaluation by generating new test cases that preserve original objectives while exposing model weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data leakage from pretraining corpora undermines benchmark validity, allowing models to match memorized content rather than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores and distorts cross-model comparisons.

Method: ArenaBencher infers core abilities of test cases, generates candidate question-answer pairs preserving original objectives, verifies correctness with LLM judges, and aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose shared weaknesses through iterative in-context demonstrations.

Result: Applied to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains, ArenaBencher produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment, and improve model separability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable path to continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation models, addressing data leakage issues and improving evaluation validity.

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Motivation: Maritime object detection faces challenges due to small target sizes and limited labeled real RGB data, requiring robust solutions for practical applications.

Result: Developed a full Python robust maritime detection pipeline with real-time performance, validated module contributions, and tested under extreme lighting and sea conditions.

Conclusion: The system preserves DETR's end-to-end set prediction while allowing speed-accuracy trade-offs, successfully addressing maritime detection challenges through integrated architectural improvements.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [99] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval is a new text-to-video evaluation benchmark that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by focusing on dynamic camera motion and providing video-level evaluation with 45k human annotations on 3k videos from ten T2V models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V evaluation benchmarks like VBench and EvalCrafter have two key limitations: they focus mainly on subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes while ignoring dynamic camera motion essential for cinematic shots, and they aggregate video-level scores into model-level scores, overlooking video-level evaluation needed to select better videos for specific prompts.

Method: DynamicEval introduces a benchmark with systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with 45k human annotations. It evaluates two dimensions: background scene consistency (using interpretable error maps from VBench motion smoothness metric, improved with object error maps to handle occlusion/disocclusion cases) and foreground object consistency (using point tracking within object instances to assess object fidelity).

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both video level and model level, with an improvement of more than 2 percentage points over existing methods.

Conclusion: DynamicEval establishes itself as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion, addressing key gaps in existing evaluation frameworks and providing better alignment with human judgments.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP is a principled extension of RED that combines restarting inertia for fast convergence with score-based priors for high-quality image reconstruction in ill-posed inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RED focus on sophisticated image priors for quality but lack principled convergence acceleration, creating a gap between reconstruction quality and convergence speed.

Method: RISP incorporates restarting inertia mechanism for fast convergence while maintaining score-based image priors for reconstruction quality, with theoretical analysis connecting it to heavy-ball ODE.

Result: RISP achieves faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED without requiring convexity of image prior, and experimental results show fast convergence with high-quality reconstructions across various imaging problems.

Conclusion: RISP successfully bridges the gap between convergence speed and reconstruction quality in ill-posed inverse problems through principled inertia-based acceleration while preserving the benefits of score-based priors.

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Image Purification strategy and Frequency-domain Flow Matching model to address spatial misalignment in ultra-low dose CT denoising, achieving state-of-the-art structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low dose CT reduces radiation exposure but introduces severe noise, artifacts, and spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT pairs, making existing denoising methods ineffective.

Method: Constructs real clinical uLDCT lung dataset, develops Image Purification strategy to generate aligned uLDCT-NDCT pairs, and proposes Frequency-domain Flow Matching model for structure-preserving denoising.

Result: IP strategy significantly enhances multiple denoising models' performance. FFM model with IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art results in anatomical structure preservation on real clinical dataset.

Conclusion: Provides effective solution to data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

TL;DR: D2RA is a training-free attack that removes watermarks from generative model outputs by projecting images onto natural priors across multiple representations, revealing vulnerabilities in current watermarking schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic watermarking methods for generative models are vulnerable to attacks, even under resource-constrained settings, highlighting the need to test and improve watermark robustness.

Method: D2RA uses a training-free, single-image approach that projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations to suppress watermark signals while maintaining visual quality.

Result: The attack consistently reduces watermark detectability across diverse watermarking schemes, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in current designs.

Conclusion: Current watermarking methods have significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited with simple, resource-efficient attacks, indicating the need for more robust watermarking designs.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at

*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle is a video-to-video style transfer framework that uses diffusion models with low-rank adapters and synthetic training from paired image data, achieving superior temporal coherence and style transfer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is video style transfer without paired video data for supervision, requiring preservation of video context while applying target styles specified by text prompts.

Method: Uses pretrained video diffusion backbones with style adapters, trains on paired still image data with synthetic video clips created through shared augmentations, and introduces Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) for independent control of context and style.

Result: Achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations that outperform existing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively across benchmarks.

Conclusion: PickStyle effectively bridges the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video style transfer through adapter-based architecture and novel guidance factorization.

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRAVL is a fine-tuning method that improves Video-Language Models' ability to detect physical implausibilities in videos, evaluated using the ImplausiBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern video generative models often produce sequences that violate physical laws, but there's no robust method for quantitatively assessing physical realism in video.

Method: Introduced TRAVL - a fine-tuning recipe combining balanced training data with trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding. Also created ImplausiBench benchmark with 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) to remove linguistic biases.

Result: Existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, exposing limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. TRAVL improves physical plausibility assessment capabilities.

Conclusion: TRAVL and ImplausiBench provide a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, addressing a challenging aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes S3FN, a semantic spectral-spatial fusion network that uses LLM-generated textual descriptions to enhance HSI classification by improving feature-label alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification faces overfitting due to limited training samples and high dimensionality, and most models are monomodal relying only on spectral-spatial data.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate class-specific textual descriptions, embeds them using pre-trained text encoders (BERT/RoBERTa), and fuses with spectral-spatial data for better feature-label alignment.

Result: Significant performance boost on three HSI benchmark datasets (Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, DeepHS-Fruit), demonstrating synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data.

Conclusion: Textual semantics can effectively complement HSI classification, paving way for semantically augmented models with improved performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAGUL is a lightweight unlearning framework for vision-language models that prevents leakage of private information in VQA tasks without altering pre-trained model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs may memorize and regurgitate private/sensitive information from training data, and visual context adds complexity to unlearning compared to text-only models.

Method: Uses cross-modal attention to identify important visual tokens, then applies external modules to encode unlearning information in low-importance visual tokens.

Result: Performs better or on par with finetuning baselines while preventing information leakage and retaining reference model behavior.

Conclusion: CAGUL provides a practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs without retraining costs or parameter modifications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

TL;DR: MaizeStandCounting (MaSC) is an automated algorithm using YOLOv9 to count maize seedlings from UAV imagery, achieving high accuracy with real-time processing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual maize stand counting is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, especially in large fields, creating a need for automated solutions to support crop management and research.

Method: Uses lightweight YOLOv9 model trained on V2-V10 growth stages, operates in two modes: mosaic image patches and raw video frames with homography alignment, includes weed discrimination and row segmentation.

Result: Strong agreement with manual counts (R²=0.616 for mosaics, R²=0.906 for raw frames), processes 83 frames in 60.63 seconds including inference and post-processing.

Conclusion: MaSC is an effective, scalable, low-cost tool for automated maize stand counting suitable for both research and production environments.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

TL;DR: Quick-CapsNet (QCN) is a faster alternative to Capsule Networks that reduces the number of capsules for 5x faster inference with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet has slow training and testing speeds, which limits its use in applications requiring fast networks, especially during inference.

Method: QCN reduces the number of capsules produced in the network, and also employs a more powerful decoder to enhance performance.

Result: QCN achieves 5x faster inference on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets with only marginal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: QCN provides a fast alternative to CapsNet that can serve as a starting point for developing CapsNet for real-time applications.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++ is an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance method that addresses off-manifold drift issues in classifier-free guidance for rectified flow models, ensuring stable and high-quality text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard classifier-free guidance (CFG) causes severe off-manifold drift when applied to rectified flow models, leading to visual artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behavior.

Method: Uses an adaptive predictor-corrector approach: first executes a conditional rectified flow update to anchor samples near learned transport paths, then applies weighted conditional correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity fields.

Result: Proven to maintain marginal consistency and bounded trajectories within data manifold, ensuring stability across guidance strengths. Outperforms standard CFG on benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, T2I-CompBench) with large-scale models like Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/3.5, and Lumina.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ successfully couples deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with geometry-aware conditioning, providing stable and improved text-to-image generation compared to standard CFG approaches.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Multimodal Models have advanced image and video quality assessment, their potential for 3D asset quality assessment remains unexplored. The authors aim to leverage these models for automatic perceptual quality evaluation of point clouds without reference data.

Method: The authors construct PIT-QMM, a novel LMM that consumes text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views end-to-end to predict quality scores, leveraging complementary information from different data modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments show PIT-QMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. The framework also enables distortion localization and identification.

Conclusion: PIT-QMM provides a new approach for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment that advances model explainability and interactivity through its multimodal framework and distortion analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stream methods for action segmentation are limited, while recent two-stream approaches show promise but lack effective feature alignment between frame-wise and action-wise streams.

Method: Dual-Stream Alignment Network with Temporal Context block using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation, plus Dual-Stream Alignment Loss with relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction components.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel datasets, with extensive ablation studies validating each component's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-stream approach with quantum-classical fusion and feature alignment significantly improves action segmentation performance, representing the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for this task.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIE proposes a video virtual try-on method that performs clothing replacement only on the first frame, then uses pose/mask guidance to generate remaining frames sequentially, avoiding complex dual-branch architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dual-branch architectures for video virtual try-on require modifying backbone networks and lack temporal characteristics in garment features, leading to high parameter counts and additional learning requirements.

Method: Use image-based clothing transfer on first frame only, then leverage pose and mask information to guide video generation model in synthesizing remaining frames sequentially under content control of edited first frame.

Result: Achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while maintaining leading performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The OIE approach demonstrates that performing clothing replacement once on the first frame is sufficient for high-quality video virtual try-on, offering significant efficiency improvements over traditional dual-branch architectures.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve personalization in diffusion models by using automatically generated masks to restrict image tokens to the subject, allowing text prompts to better control the background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized diffusion models often recreate the subject image while ignoring text prompts, limiting control over generated content.

Method: Using IP-Adapter's automatically generated masks in a second pass to mask image tokens, restricting them to the subject and allowing text prompts to attend to the background.

Result: The method produces images that accurately depict the subject while matching text prompts, showing high prompt and source image alignment compared to other methods.

Conclusion: Masking image tokens to restrict them to the subject enables better text prompt control over background content in personalized diffusion models.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

TL;DR: Comparison of Transformer-based models and Vision-Language Models for automated text box placement in layout design, showing Transformers generally outperform VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to balance visual appeal and communication efficiency in layout design for advertisements and web pages through automated text placement.

Method: Evaluated standard Transformer-based method, small VLM (Phi3.5-vision), large pretrained VLM (Gemini), and extended Transformer processing multiple images on Crello dataset.

Result: Standard Transformer-based models outperform VLM-based approaches, especially with richer appearance information. All methods struggle with very small text or dense layouts.

Conclusion: Task-specific architectures show benefits over general VLMs for layout design, suggesting directions for future improvements in automated layout systems.

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM
(Gemini), and an extended Transformer that processes multiple images.
Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

### [115] [TCIP: Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid Network for Deformable Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07666)
*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCIP is a deformable medical image registration model that uses Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) to prevent anatomical misalignment accumulation and dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy to adaptively determine iteration numbers, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pyramid networks in medical image registration suffer from propagating anatomical misalignments and lack adaptive iteration control, leading to either premature termination or excessive iterations that degrade registration accuracy.

Method: Proposed FERM module with three sequential blocks for feature extraction, suppression, and deformation estimation, combined with dual-stage TCI strategy that assesses registration stability and convergence to adaptively determine iteration numbers.

Result: TCIP outperforms state-of-the-art registration networks on three brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset in terms of accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and compact parameter size.

Conclusion: The proposed FERM and TCI components effectively address anatomical misalignment accumulation and adaptive iteration control, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability when integrated with existing registration networks.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video synthesis method that enables mixed-granularity control (from exact 4D trajectories to coarse text prompts) using variational inference with multiple video generation backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models are limited to fixed input formats, but real video workflows need flexible control with varying granularity - from precise object trajectories to coarse text descriptions.

Method: Formulates video synthesis as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, using multiple video generation backbones. Employs step-wise KL divergence minimization over annealed distributions and context-conditioned factorization to avoid local optima.

Result: Produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the need for mixed-granularity control in video synthesis while maintaining diversity for under-specified elements.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The CNN-BYOL hybrid method shows promising performance for accurate fault detection in induction motors, providing a robust methodology for industrial online monitoring.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLH is a mutual learning framework that enhances center-based hashing by transferring local similarity knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Center-based hashing methods capture global data distributions well but underutilize local similarity information, while pairwise methods preserve local similarity but may not capture global structures effectively.

Method: Proposes Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH) with two branches: strong center-based and weak pairwise-based, using iterative mutual learning and a novel mixture-of-hash-experts module for cross-branch interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments show MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The mutual learning framework effectively combines the strengths of both center-based and pairwise-based approaches, demonstrating superior performance in large-scale image retrieval.

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Repainter is a reinforcement learning framework for e-commerce image inpainting that removes intrusive elements like watermarks using spatial-matting trajectory refinement and Group Relative Policy Optimization, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Product images in e-commerce often contain intrusive elements like watermarks and promotional text that degrade visual appeal and advertising effectiveness. Existing diffusion-based inpainting methods struggle with reliable object removal and domain-specific adaptation in commercial settings.

Method: Proposes Repainter framework that integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize background context, and uses a composite reward mechanism balancing global, local, and semantic constraints.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenes with intricate compositions. Also introduces EcomPaint-100K dataset and EcomPaint-Bench benchmark for fair evaluation.

Conclusion: Repainter effectively addresses e-commerce inpainting challenges by combining reinforcement learning with specialized attention mechanisms and comprehensive reward design, demonstrating superior performance in removing intrusive elements from product images.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SyncHuman combines 2D multiview and 3D native generative models for high-quality 3D human reconstruction from single images, addressing challenges in difficult poses and fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned models suffer from inaccurate 3D priors and struggle with challenging poses and fine details in photorealistic 3D human reconstruction.

Method: Jointly fine-tune multiview and 3D native generative models with pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention, then use feature injection to lift fine details from 2D images onto aligned 3D shapes.

Result: Achieves robust and photorealistic 3D human reconstruction even for challenging poses, outperforming baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: SyncHuman demonstrates a promising direction for future 3D generation models by effectively integrating complementary strengths of 2D and 3D generative approaches.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ComGS introduces Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient relightable object reconstruction and a simplified lighting estimation approach for 3D object-scene composition in Gaussian Splatting, achieving real-time rendering at 28 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting enables immersive rendering but faces challenges with realistic 3D object-scene composition due to baked appearance and shadow information causing inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes.

Method: Uses Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient lighting and occlusion storage with 3D interpolation instead of ray tracing, and simplifies lighting estimation by focusing on environment lighting at object placement using a fine-tuned diffusion model.

Result: Achieves at least 2x speedup in reconstruction, enables real-time shadow computation, produces visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and achieves 28 FPS rendering with only 36 seconds for editing.

Conclusion: ComGS provides an effective framework for high-quality, real-time 3D object-scene composition in Gaussian Splatting by addressing both relightable reconstruction and lighting estimation challenges.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

### [122] [UltraLED: Learning to See Everything in Ultra-High Dynamic Range Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07741)
*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraLED is a two-stage framework that reconstructs ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes from a single short-exposure RAW image, using exposure correction and brightness-aware denoising to avoid ghosting artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHDR scenes with significant exposure disparities make it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods suffer from misalignment and ghosting artifacts, while single short-exposure RAW images offer higher bit depth and predictable noise characteristics for better reconstruction.

Method: A two-stage framework: first performs exposure correction via a ratio map to balance dynamic range, then uses a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. Uses only a single short-exposure RAW frame as input.

Result: Extensive experiments show that UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches for UHDR reconstruction. The method avoids ghosting and motion blur artifacts common in multi-exposure approaches.

Conclusion: UltraLED demonstrates that high-quality UHDR reconstruction is achievable from a single short-exposure RAW image, providing a robust solution for dynamic scenes while avoiding alignment issues of bracketing methods.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

*Junhao He,Jiaxu Wang,Jia Li,Mingyuan Sun,Qiang Zhang,Jiahang Cao,Ziyi Zhang,Yi Gu,Jingkai Sun,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines low-framerate RGB videos with high-framerate event streams to reconstruct Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, using event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization and overcome large inter-frame motion challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing Dynamic 3DGS from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging due to large inter-frame motions that increase solution uncertainty. Event cameras can capture rapid visual changes robustly but lack color information. Combining both modalities can address the motion uncertainty problem.

Method: Uses event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization. First extracts motion priors from event streams using LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework. Then employs geometry-aware data association to build event-Gaussian motion correspondence, with motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label strategies.

Result: Outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes. Effectively optimizes dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages event stream data to provide deterministic constraints for large inter-frame motions, enabling robust reconstruction of Dynamic 3DGS from low-framerate RGB videos when combined with high-framerate event streams.

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Motivation: To improve brain tumor segmentation accuracy in MRI images and assist physicians in clinical decision-making by making AI models more transparent and trustworthy through explainable AI techniques.

Method: Evaluated three deep learning models (UNet, ResUNet, AttUNet) on BraTS2020 dataset using Adam optimizer, with XAI techniques including Grad-CAM and attention-based visualization to analyze model decisions and focus areas.

Result: ResUNet outperformed other models in final testing with superior Dice and Jaccard similarity scores, accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. XAI techniques provided valuable insights into model focus areas and attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: ResUNet is recommended as the best-performing model for automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments, with XAI successfully enhancing model transparency and interpretability.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

<details>

Motivation: Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks focus on either egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video or geographic perspective with maps, but fail to assess VLMs' ability to reason with both contexts simultaneously, which is crucial for applications like traffic management and emergency response.

Method: Introduced Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench) that requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over unobserved spatial-temporal regions.

Result: Evaluation of 10+ popular VLMs shows even the best proprietary model (Gemini-2.5-Pro at 34.9%) significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%). Analysis reveals three key deficiencies: imbalanced context utilization, weak temporal forecasting, and poor map-video alignment.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench provides valuable insights into VLMs' spatial-temporal intelligence limitations and opens new research opportunities for improving geographic temporal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

### [126] [FMANet: A Novel Dual-Phase Optical Flow Approach with Fusion Motion Attention Network for Robust Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07810)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thi Duyen Ngo,Thanh Ha Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM-COF, a comprehensive motion representation that integrates optical flow from both onset-apex and apex-offset phases of micro-expressions, and FMANet, an end-to-end neural network that adaptively fuses motion cues from both phases for improved micro-expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current micro-expression recognition methods only use optical flow between onset and apex frames, missing important motion information from the apex-to-offset phase, which limits recognition performance.

Method: Proposed MM-COF representation combines optical flow from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor, and FMANet network with learnable modules for dual-phase analysis and magnitude modulation to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions.

Result: Experimental evaluations on MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets show that the proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperform existing methods in micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: The dual-phase framework with learnable modules significantly advances micro-expression recognition by capturing comprehensive motion dynamics from both onset-apex and apex-offset phases.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

*Kanglin Ning,Ruzhao Chen,Penghong Wang,Xingtao Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel depth estimation framework for 360° indoor panoramas that integrates room geometry constraints through layout prediction and background segmentation to improve depth estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation methods for 360° indoor panoramas focus on pixel-level accuracy but cause oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity, highlighting the need for better geometric constraints.

Method: A shared feature encoder with task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation, plus room geometry-based background depth resolving and background-segmentation-guided fusion strategies.

Result: Significantly superior performance compared to current open-source methods on Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates room geometry constraints into depth estimation, achieving improved performance for 360° indoor panorama depth prediction.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

*Shohei Enomoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACAVP is a new visual prompting method that combines affine, color, and additive transformations to enhance expressivity while using TrivialAugment to prevent overfitting, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional visual prompting methods suffer from limited expressivity due to simple additive transformations and tend to overfit when parameter count increases, leading to lower accuracy compared to other adaptation approaches.

Method: Proposes ACAVP with three complementary transformations: affine transformation for task-specific prompt regions, color transformation for emphasizing relevant features, and additive transformation. Also introduces TrivialAugment data augmentation to address overfitting.

Result: ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, shows superior robustness to distribution shifts, and maintains minimal computational overhead. TrivialAugment also improves existing VP methods by up to 12 percentage points.

Conclusion: ACAVP effectively addresses expressivity and overfitting limitations in visual prompting through complementary transformations and appropriate data augmentation, establishing a new state-of-the-art for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of vision models.

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human-object interaction benchmarks only cover simple interactions, while real-world scenes involve complex multi-human multi-object interactions that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative.

Method: MMHOI-Net uses an end-to-end transformer-based neural network with structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance interaction prediction.

Result: Experiments on MMHOI and CORE4D datasets show state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, with excellent accuracy and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: MMHOI provides a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research, and MMHOI-Net demonstrates superior performance in modeling complex multi-human multi-object interactions.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

*Houqiang Zhong,Zhenglong Wu,Sihua Fu,Zihan Zheng,Xin Jin,Xiaoyun Zhang,Li Song,Qiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS is a regularization framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for large urban scenes by adding multi-scale supervision and size regularization to reduce aliasing artifacts and improve rendering stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability in large urban environments, especially at high resolutions like 4K, due to mismatch between Gaussian primitives and multi-scale urban geometry.

Method: Two synergistic regularizers: pyramidal multi-scale supervision that enforces consistency against pre-filtered image pyramids, and explicit size regularization that imposes physically-grounded lower bounds on 3D Gaussian dimensions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with ~1.5 dB PSNR gains over CityGaussian, maintains superior quality and robustness under 4K rendering on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D datasets.

Conclusion: PrismGS provides a plug-and-play framework that significantly improves 3DGS for large-scale urban rendering by addressing aliasing and stability issues through physically-grounded regularization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge communication between hearing-/speech-challenged individuals and others by providing immediate translation from sign language videos to speech, avoiding latency and cascading errors of multi-stage systems.

Method: Combines I3D-based feature extraction with specialized feature transformation network and audio generation pipeline, using novel Non-Maximal Suppression algorithm for temporal detection of signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences.

Result: Achieved Top-1 accuracies of 72.01% on ASL-Citizen-1500 and 78.67% on WLASL-100 datasets, with audio quality metrics (PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework successfully translates isolated sign sequences directly to speech with competitive performance and intelligible audio quality, providing immediate communication benefits.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS is a novel framework that uses semantic understanding from 2D foundation models to actively guide 3D geometry reconstruction from sparse views, achieving state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis with superior geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods treat semantics as passive features on potentially flawed geometry, but for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding should actively guide geometry formation to overcome geometric ambiguity.

Method: AlignGS performs end-to-end optimization of geometry and semantics by distilling priors from 2D foundation models and using novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and reconstructions with superior geometric accuracy on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic priors as geometric regularizers produces more coherent and complete 3D models from limited input views, validating the approach of using semantics as an active guiding force in reconstruction.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: To address critical challenges in automated toxicity testing systems and demonstrate how machine learning can identify toxicant-induced changes efficiently.

Method: Used self-supervised learning on the EmbryoNet dataset containing zebrafish embryo phenotypes from various chemical compounds targeting different developmental processes.

Result: Learned representations effectively distinguished between modes-of-action of different compounds and identified toxicant-induced changes.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning is suitable for automated toxicity testing and can be integrated into physical testing devices like the TOXBOX project.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between

of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

TL;DR: XYZCylinder is a feedforward model for 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenes that uses unified cylinder camera modeling and hybrid representations to improve generalization across camera configurations and reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward reconstruction methods have limited generalization capability when camera configurations change and reduced reconstruction accuracy due to sparse views and complex driving scenes.

Method: Proposes Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) to handle different camera configurations with adjustable parameters, and uses Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) with hybrid representations to lift 2D image features to 3D space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings and can generalize to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing better generalization across camera configurations and improved reconstruction accuracy through its unified camera modeling and hybrid representation approach.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Conclusion: MARC demonstrates potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings like video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual

ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,

Motivation: Video Foundation Models struggle with compositional scenarios like motion, numeracy, and spatial relations, requiring better text-image alignment.

Method: Integrates and optimizes new parameters guided by layout-attention objective, formulates video generation as streaming with parametric memory mechanism supporting insert, read, update, delete operations.

Result: TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge with powerful transferability and generalization, achieving effective cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation.

Conclusion: TTOM establishes as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text detection datasets target natural/document scenes with regular text, but anime scenes have diverse, irregular text styles that are easily confused with visual elements, creating a significant gap in existing datasets.

Method: Created AnimeText dataset with hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples specifically designed for anime scenarios, then conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection methods.

Result: Models trained on AnimeText outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection tasks, demonstrating superior performance for complex anime scenes.

Conclusion: AnimeText effectively addresses the gap in text detection for anime scenes and provides a robust dataset that improves detection performance in complex anime scenarios compared to existing datasets.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

*Yifang Yin,Shengkai Chen,Yiyao Li,Lu Wang,Ruibing Jin,Wei Cui,Shili Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCast is a novel precipitation nowcasting training pipeline using short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss, integrated with CasCast diffusion framework to overcome deterministic model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate precipitation nowcasting is crucial for disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization. Existing non-autoregressive approaches need improvement in handling prediction horizons and addressing blurriness in deterministic outputs.

Method: Proposes SimCast with short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss for heavy rainfall regions. Integrates SimCast into CasCast diffusion framework to combine deterministic predictions with probabilistic modeling advantages.

Result: Achieves mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, significantly outperforming existing approaches without additional inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves precipitation nowcasting accuracy by combining knowledge distillation techniques with diffusion modeling, addressing both deterministic and probabilistic challenges in weather forecasting.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

*Yidi Liu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Huang,Jie Xiao,Dong Li,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony is a two-stage VAE framework for UHD image restoration that balances computational efficiency with high-frequency detail preservation through latent space regularization and high-frequency-aware reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention in UHD image restoration, overcoming VAE limitations where Gaussian constraints discard degradation-specific high-frequency information.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage One introduces LH-VAE with visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations for semantic robustness, plus latent equivariance for high-frequency reconstruction. Stage Two jointly trains the refined VAE with restoration model using HF-LoRA - encoder LoRA with fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss and decoder LoRA with perception-oriented loss, trained via alternating optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy with tunable fidelity-perception trade-offs via parameter α.

Conclusion: Latent Harmony successfully redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by overcoming the efficiency-detail trade-off through joint latent space regularization and high-frequency-aware reconstruction, providing flexible performance tuning.

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Abstract tags are more effective than object tags for image privacy classification when tag budget is limited, but object tags become equally useful when more tags are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which type of tags (object vs abstract) is more suitable for the context-dependent and subjective task of image privacy classification, as object tags are typically used but abstract tags may provide better contextual understanding.

Method: Explored the effectiveness of object tags versus abstract tags for image privacy classification under different tag budget constraints.

Result: Abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited, while object-related information becomes equally useful when a larger number of tags per image is available.

Conclusion: These findings will guide future research in developing more accurate image privacy classifiers by considering the role of tag types and quantity.

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

### [143] [Is Architectural Complexity Always the Answer? A Case Study on SwinIR vs. an Efficient CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07984)
*Chandresh Sutariya,Nitin Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A standard lightweight CNN achieves competitive performance (37.4 dB PSNR) to state-of-the-art SwinIR Transformer (39.03 dB PSNR) for low-light image restoration, while being 55x smaller and requiring 13x fewer training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency in low-light image restoration, where Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance but have high computational costs that limit practical applications.

Method: Comparative analysis between the state-of-the-art SwinIR Transformer model and a standard lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the task of simultaneous high-frequency detail restoration and severe noise suppression in low-light imagery.

Result: The CNN achieved a competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB compared to SwinIR's 39.03 dB, while being over 55 times smaller and converging in only 10 epochs versus SwinIR's 132 epochs.

Conclusion: Standard CNNs can provide near state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational overhead, making them compelling choices for real-world applications with resource constraints.

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer low latency and low energy advantages ideal for portable electronics and mobile robots, but existing human pose estimation methods primarily use RGB cameras. This work aims to leverage event camera data for pose estimation.

Method: Proposes GraphEnet - a Graph Neural Network that uses the sparse nature of event camera output with intermediate line-based event representation, incorporating novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence-based pooling.

Result: First work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation. The method estimates 2D human pose of a single person at high frequency.

Conclusion: GraphEnet successfully demonstrates the application of Graph Neural Networks to event camera data for human pose estimation, providing an open-source implementation for the research community.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable

### [145] [CIR-CoT: Towards Interpretable Composed Image Retrieval via End-to-End Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08003)
*Weihuang Lin,Yiwei Ma,Jiayi Ji,Xiaoshuai Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIR-CoT is a novel multimodal LLM that integrates explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning for composed image retrieval, achieving competitive performance while providing transparent decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models and Multimodal LLMs for composed image retrieval are 'black boxes' that lack interpretability and struggle with complex instructions, limiting user understanding and model capability.

Method: Developed CIR-CoT as an end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM that generates interpretable reasoning chains before retrieval. Created structured CoT annotations through a three-stage process (caption, reasoning, conclusion) and fine-tuned the model to produce this structured output.

Result: Achieved highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrated remarkable generalization on out-of-domain CIRCO dataset.

Conclusion: CIR-CoT establishes a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems by integrating explicit reasoning chains that enhance cross-modal understanding and provide transparency.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based perception systems in autonomous driving struggle with accurate depth estimation due to the absence of explicit depth information, leading to ambiguity in 3D object detection.

Method: Proposes RayFusion, a ray-based fusion approach that leverages ray occupancy information from multiple collaborators to reduce redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show RayFusion consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models and substantially advances collaborative visual perception performance.

Conclusion: RayFusion effectively enhances the detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems by addressing depth estimation ambiguity through ray-based fusion.

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RASALoRE is a novel two-stage weakly supervised anomaly detection framework for brain MRI scans that uses discriminative dual prompt tuning and region-aware spatial attention with location-based random embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans is crucial for quick and accurate detection when precise pixel-level annotations are unavailable and only weak labels (slice-level) are available.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) generates high-quality pseudo weak masks from slice-level labels; 2) Segmentation network with region-aware spatial attention using fixed location-based random embeddings to focus on anomalous regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly outperforming existing WSAD methods while using less than 8 million parameters. Extensive evaluations on BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets show substantial performance improvement with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: RASALoRE provides an effective and efficient solution for weakly supervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans, demonstrating superior performance with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million

TL;DR: RetouchLLM is a training-free white-box image retouching system that performs interpretable, code-based adjustments on high-resolution images without requiring paired training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting adaptability to user-specific adjustments.

Method: The framework progressively enhances images through two modules: a visual critic that identifies differences between input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes for multi-step retouching similar to human workflow.

Result: The approach generalizes well across diverse retouching styles and enables interpretable, controllable adjustments through natural language-based user interaction.

Conclusion: RetouchLLM provides a training-free, white-box solution for image retouching that offers interpretability and user control while handling diverse adjustment needs.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical ResNet architecture for multitemporal time series classification that uses class hierarchy and penalty maps to improve discrimination across different semantic levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of time series multispectral images by leveraging class hierarchies and training modular networks that can handle limited training samples while maintaining coherent hierarchical transitions.

Method: Modified ResNet with additional branches for hierarchical classification, hierarchy-penalty maps to prevent incoherent transitions, and modular training that progresses from general to specific classes using class-hierarchy labels.

Result: Effective generalization across hierarchical levels and accurate micro-class classification on new target areas, with better representation of minority classes in Amazonian Forest Sentinel-2 data.

Conclusion: The hierarchical modular network successfully improves discrimination capabilities across semantic levels and adapts well to new areas through fine-tuning, demonstrating robust performance for time series classification.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection benchmarks lack specificity, diversity, and real-world applicability, failing to address the growing threat of hyper-realistic synthetic media on social media platforms.

Method: Created RedFace dataset using 9 commercial online platforms to generate deepfakes, simulating real-world black-box scenarios with diverse manipulation techniques found 'in the wild' rather than academic methods.

Result: Extensive experiments (cross-domain, intra-domain, social network simulations) show limited practicality of existing detection schemes against real-world applications, with RedFace revealing performance gaps compared to conventional datasets.

Conclusion: RedFace effectively bridges the gap between academic evaluations and real-world deepfake detection needs, demonstrating the limitations of current detection methods and providing a more realistic benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect realism, creating an urgent need for reliable detection mechanisms to identify subtle anomalies that violate physical laws.

Method: Proposes NSG statistic based on probability flow conservation principles, uses pre-trained diffusion models for NSG estimation through spatial gradient approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling, and computes Maximum Mean Discrepancy between NSG features for detection.

Result: NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, demonstrating superior detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-driven approach effectively detects AI-generated videos by capturing distributional shifts through NSG features, providing a reliable detection mechanism for realistic synthetic videos.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Method: Uses a shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance, fine-tuning specific layers of victim models using surrogate datasets. Incorporates topological alignment loss to optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward target samples.

Result: Experimental results on 4 image datasets, 5 model architectures, and 2 hashing methods show DarkHash outperforms state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods and withstands existing mainstream defense methods.

Conclusion: DarkHash successfully demonstrates the first effective data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing models while maintaining original retrieval performance and evading current defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

*Ankit Gahlawat,Anirban Mukherjee,Dinesh Babu Jayagopi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel label refinement pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate accurate face segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions, enabling improved face parsing under extreme viewing angles without ground-truth 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face parsing under extreme viewing angles is challenging due to limited labeled data, and manual annotation is costly and impractical at scale.

Method: Jointly fitting two 3DGS models - one to RGB images and one to initial segmentation maps - to enforce multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling synthesis of pose-diverse training data with minimal post-processing.

Result: Fine-tuning on the refined dataset significantly improves accuracy on challenging head poses while maintaining strong performance on standard views, achieving superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable and effective solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings without requiring ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a small set of initial images.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

### [154] [Random Window Augmentations for Deep Learning Robustness in CT and Liver Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08116)
*Eirik A. Østmo,Kristoffer K. Wickstrøm,Keyur Radiya,Michael C. Kampffmeyer,Karl Øyvind Mikalsen,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Random windowing, a CT-specific augmentation method that uses Hounsfield Unit distributions to improve liver tumor segmentation performance, outperforming standard intensity augmentations that cause artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image augmentations developed for natural images don't work well for CT scans because they ignore the physical meaning of Hounsfield Units, leading to artifacts and poor generalization in medical image analysis.

Method: Random windowing augmentation that exploits the HU intensity distribution in CT images to encourage robustness to contrast-enhancement variations and handle poor contrast/timing issues.

Result: Significantly increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in liver tumor segmentation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CT-specific augmentation methods like Random windowing are crucial for effective deep learning in medical imaging, as they respect the physical properties of CT data and prevent artifacts from naive intensity augmentations.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

TL;DR: AR-Drag is a reinforcement learning-enhanced autoregressive video diffusion model that enables real-time image-to-video generation with precise motion control using only 1.3B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of real-time motion-controllable video generation, including latency issues in bidirectional diffusion models, limitations of existing AR approaches, and quality degradation in few-step generation.

Method: Fine-tune a base image-to-video model for basic motion control, then enhance it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Uses Self-Rollout mechanism to preserve Markov property and selective stochasticity in denoising steps to accelerate training.

Result: Achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment while significantly reducing latency compared to state-of-the-art motion-controllable video diffusion models. Works effectively with only 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: AR-Drag successfully enables real-time motion-controllable video generation with improved quality and reduced latency, representing a significant advancement in autoregressive video diffusion models.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

### [156] [Improving Temporal Understanding Logic Consistency in Video-Language Models via Attention Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08138)
*Chengzhi Li,Heyan Huang,Ping Jian,Zhen Yang,Yaning Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-LLMs suffer from logical inconsistency when answering rephrased questions about videos. The paper identifies poor temporal discrimination in cross-modal attention as the root cause and proposes TCAS to enhance temporal resolution, improving consistency and temporal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts reliability. In video-language models, this inconsistency problem is particularly concerning as they fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on video content.

Method: Proposed Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) - an attention enhancement method that constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to improve the model's temporal resolution capability and temporal understanding logic consistency.

Result: Experimental results show the method significantly enhances temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Interpretability analyses confirm improved temporal discriminability of attention heads. The method also achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By enhancing consistency through TCAS, the method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding, validating that improved attention mechanisms can address logical inconsistency issues in Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMVSR is a unified generative video super-resolution framework that incorporates hybrid-modal conditions (text, images, videos) to enhance video generation fidelity, outperforming existing methods and enabling 4K video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cascaded video super-resolution methods are limited to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation.

Method: UniMMVSR uses a latent video diffusion model with comprehensive exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques. It employs distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to precisely handle varied correlations between different condition types and target videos.

Result: UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and higher conformity to multi-modal conditions. It successfully enables multi-modal guided generation of 4K video when combined with a base model.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the limitation of text-only conditions in video super-resolution and demonstrates the feasibility of high-quality 4K video generation through hybrid-modal conditioning.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

TL;DR: MURE is a multimodal reasoning framework for image editing that uses interleaved text-image Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Multimodal Deep Confidence to improve precision in handling complex object intersections and spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based image editing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained spatial relationships due to lack of explicit reasoning process and visual cues for pixel-level details.

Method: Proposes MURE framework with interleaved text-image CoT reasoning, where textual descriptions are followed by visual cues (positional masks, content representations). Introduces MMDC paradigm that explores visual reasoning paths and prunes low-quality branches using deep confidence scores.

Result: Method decomposes complex editing tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage. Extensive experiments show significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks. Created CoT-Edit-14K dataset with 14K high-quality editing examples.

Conclusion: MURE successfully shifts visual editing from text-based reasoning to multimodal reasoning, enabling high-fidelity edited results through explicit visual reasoning processes and confidence-based path selection.

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a bootstrapping algorithm for fine-grained visual classification that iteratively re-aligns training samples to handle geometric biases without requiring aligned training data, outperforming equivariant and canonicalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification requires sensitivity to subtle visual cues while being robust to spatial transformations. Existing methods rely on heavy data augmentation or equivariant architectures, which have limitations in expressivity and cost.

Method: A bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption, with convergence guarantees for arbitrary compact groups.

Result: The method consistently outperforms equivariant and canonicalization baselines on four FGVC benchmarks and performs on par with augmentation-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed bootstrapping approach effectively handles geometric biases in FGVC tasks without requiring aligned training data, offering a robust alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag is a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging for simultaneous object relocation and text-based image editing, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods are limited to static relocation. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by combining both approaches.

Method: The framework treats object dragging as image reconstruction with two synergistic branches: moving-reconstruction branch using energy-based gradient guidance for accurate object movement, and text-driven editing branch sharing gradient signals for consistent transformations. Uses DDPM inversion and prior information injection to preserve object structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show that InstructUDrag enables flexible, high-fidelity image editing with precision in object relocation and semantic control over image content.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully combines text instructions with object dragging, providing both precise object positioning and semantic editing capabilities in a unified approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

*Mu Li,Yin Wang,Zhiying Leng,Jiapeng Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineDual is a tri-stage method for dual-human motion generation that models dynamic hierarchical interactions from individual to inter-individual levels, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring the dynamic nature of motion changes with distance and the hierarchical structure from individual to inter-individual to overall motion.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Self-Learning Stage uses LLM to divide dual-human text into individual texts for feature alignment; 2) Adaptive Adjustment Stage predicts interaction distance and models interactions dynamically; 3) Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage uses overall text features to refine motion.

Result: Extensive evaluations on dual-human motion datasets demonstrate that FineDual outperforms existing approaches in generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.

Conclusion: FineDual effectively models dynamic hierarchical human interaction by addressing both distance dynamics and hierarchical structure in dual-human motion generation.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AdaGC, a novel framework for single-positive multi-label learning in remote sensing imagery that uses adaptive gradient calibration to handle supervision ambiguity and label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification provides better semantic understanding of remote sensing imagery but complete annotations are expensive. Single-positive multi-label learning is a practical alternative but introduces supervision ambiguity that needs specialized solutions.

Method: AdaGC uses gradient calibration mechanism combined with Mixup and dual EMA module for robust pseudo-label generation. It adaptively triggers gradient calibration after warm-up based on training dynamics to mitigate overfitting to label noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets under different label noise types show AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: AdaGC is an effective and generalizable framework for single-positive multi-label learning in remote sensing that successfully addresses supervision ambiguity and label noise challenges.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

*Haipeng Liu,Yang Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NTN-Diff is a novel diffusion model for text-guided image inpainting that addresses semantics consistency and unmasked region preservation by decomposing frequency bands and using null-text guidance during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods failed to simultaneously preserve unmasked regions and achieve semantics consistency between masked and unmasked regions due to entanglement of hybrid frequency bands with different robustness to text prompts.

Method: Proposes null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion that decomposes denoising into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages. Uses stable mid-frequency band as guidance for null-text denoising of low-frequency band, followed by text-guided denoising for consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show NTN-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models for text-guided image inpainting, achieving better semantics consistency while preserving unmasked regions.

Conclusion: NTN-Diff successfully addresses both preservation of unmasked regions and semantics consistency by disentangling frequency bands during the denoising process, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Motivation: Address challenges in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in visual scenes, as prior open-vocabulary object detection methods often fail in such cases.

Method: Jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module to robustly integrate linguistic and embodied cues.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines on two datasets, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection in complex or cluttered environments.

Conclusion: The proposed ERU framework effectively improves disambiguation capabilities in embodied reference understanding tasks.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach

TL;DR: Neural Exposure Fields (NExF) is a novel technique that learns a neural field predicting optimal exposure per 3D point, enabling robust 3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis in challenging high dynamic range scenarios without requiring multi-exposure captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural scene representations degrade when handling real-world data with strong exposure variations (e.g., indoor/outdoor scenes, rooms with windows), limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes learning a neural field that predicts optimal exposure values per 3D point, jointly optimizing scene representation and exposure field through a novel neural conditioning mechanism in 3D space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with over 55% improvement over best-performing baselines, trains faster than prior works, and enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios without post-processing.

Conclusion: NExF successfully addresses exposure variations in 3D scene reconstruction by generalizing exposure optimization from 2D images to 3D space, providing robust performance for challenging real-world captures.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

### [166] [LTCA: Long-range Temporal Context Attention for Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08305)
*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LTCA mechanism for referring video segmentation that balances locality and globality through stacked sparse local attentions and global query interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RVOS methods fail to balance locality and globality in temporal context modeling, with computation complexity increasing significantly with video length.

Method: Uses stacked sparse local attentions with dilated window attention across frames, plus global query interactions to aggregate global context into object features.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art on four benchmarks with 11.3% and 8.3% improvements on MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Conclusion: LTCA effectively balances locality and globality in temporal context modeling for RVOS with improved performance.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

### [167] [Unlocking 3D Affordance Segmentation with 2D Semantic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08316)
*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic-grounded learning paradigm for 3D affordance segmentation that transfers knowledge from 2D Vision Foundation Models to address challenges in 3D data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D affordance segmentation rely on generic point cloud encoders that overlook intrinsic 3D data challenges like sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity, leading to semantically inconsistent functional boundaries.

Method: Introduces Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT) for pre-training 3D encoders with lifted 2D semantics, and Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST) that integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-grounded learning paradigm effectively bridges 2D semantic knowledge with 3D processing, enabling more precise and semantically consistent affordance segmentation.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

*Yushi Huang,Xingtong Ge,Ruihao Gong,Chengtao Lv,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo is an efficient post-training framework that replaces self-attention with linear attention in video diffusion models, achieving 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving quality, with distilled models reaching 15.92x latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models have high computation costs due to quadratic complexity of self-attention, and existing linear attention approaches require expensive pretraining and have limited expressiveness.

Method: Uses selective transfer to automatically select layers for conversion to linear attention, and introduces anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective to align sample distributions across timesteps efficiently.

Result: Achieves 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, with 4-step distilled model achieving 15.92x latency reduction with minimal quality drop.

Conclusion: LinVideo provides an effective data-free post-training solution for accelerating video diffusion models without sacrificing performance, overcoming limitations of existing linear attention approaches.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

### [169] [Evaluating Small Vision-Language Models on Distance-Dependent Traffic Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08352)
*Nikos Theodoridis,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Ganesh Sistu,Fiachra Collins,Anthony Scanlan,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DTPQA is the first VQA benchmark for traffic scene perception with distance annotations, showing small VLMs significantly underperform humans (~60% vs ~85% accuracy) on perception-only questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate VLMs for automated driving systems, focusing on perception capabilities at both close and long ranges in traffic scenes, since safety-critical applications require reliable perception and critical objects are often distant.

Method: Introduced DTPQA benchmark with distance-annotated perception questions in traffic scenes, excluding reasoning questions. Evaluated several state-of-the-art small VLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Small VLMs significantly underperformed compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for best small VLM vs ~85% human performance). Specific perception tasks like distinguishing left from right remained particularly challenging.

Conclusion: Current small VLMs have significant perception limitations in traffic scenes, especially at distance, highlighting the need for improved perception capabilities before deployment in safety-critical automated driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light

is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

### [171] [Hyperspectral data augmentation with transformer-based diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08363)
*Mattia Ferrari,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data augmentation method using guided diffusion models with lightweight transformers, modified loss functions, and optimized schedulers to address overfitting in hyperspectral forest classification with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for hyperspectral land-cover classification face overfitting risks with small labeled datasets, requiring effective data augmentation techniques.

Method: Proposed guided diffusion model for data augmentation, implemented with lightweight transformer network, modified weighted loss function, and optimized cosine variance scheduler for efficient training on small datasets.

Result: Outperformed other data augmentation techniques in forest classification with 10 forest types using PRISMA hyperspectral images, achieving better average and weighted average accuracy with stable training behavior.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses overfitting in deep learning for hyperspectral classification with limited data, providing stable and superior performance compared to existing augmentation techniques.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVideo is a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that combines a Multimodal Large Language Model for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT for video generation, enabling diverse video tasks under a single instruction paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models are largely limited to the image domain, leaving video generation and editing as an underexplored area that requires specialized solutions.

Method: Dual-stream architecture with MLLM for instruction interpretation and MMDiT for video generation, jointly trained across multiple video tasks under a unified multimodal instruction paradigm.

Result: UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing, while enabling task composition and generalization to unseen editing instructions.

Conclusion: The unified design enables generalization through task composition and transfer learning, supporting complex multimodal instructions without explicit training, making UniVideo a versatile framework for video content creation and editing.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining LayoutLMv3 for layout detection and GPT-4o with in-context learning to automatically extract and link legend symbols with descriptions from historical maps, achieving 88% F-1 score and 85% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical map legends are crucial for interpretation but have inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats, making automatic extraction challenging. Existing methods focus mainly on segmentation or OCR without effectively matching symbols to descriptions.

Method: Combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and descriptions via bounding box predictions. Uses structured JSON prompts for improved performance.

Result: GPT-4 with structured JSON prompts outperforms baseline, achieving 88% F-1 score and 85% IoU. Performance is influenced by prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and improves indexing and searchability of historical maps across various visual styles.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

### [174] [Robust Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation based on Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08393)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A curriculum-based framework called LFC for source-free domain adaptation that uses easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula to progressively adapt models without accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data privacy and security concerns in medical imaging by enabling domain adaptation without source data access, while improving learning procedure through progressive adaptation.

Method: Proposes LFC framework with two curricula: easy-to-hard (starts with easy samples, gradually increases difficulty) and source-to-target (ensures smooth transition from source to target domain).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation, surpassing existing approaches.

Conclusion: The curriculum-based approach effectively enables source-free domain adaptation for medical imaging tasks while maintaining data privacy and improving adaptation stability.

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoVerse is a new benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Video models on temporal causality and world knowledge, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V benchmarks are insufficient for state-of-the-art models, lacking evaluation of temporal causality and world knowledge needed for world models.

Method: Collected diverse videos, extracted event-level descriptions with temporal causality, created 300 prompts with binary evaluation questions across 10 dimensions, and developed a QA-based evaluation pipeline using vision-language models.

Result: VideoVerse comprises 300 curated prompts, 815 events, and 793 binary evaluation questions, enabling systematic evaluation of T2V models.

Conclusion: VideoVerse provides comprehensive assessment of T2V models' capabilities in understanding temporal causality and world knowledge, revealing how far current models are from true world models.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

*Kaiwen Zheng,Yuji Wang,Qianli Ma,Huayu Chen,Jintao Zhang,Yogesh Balaji,Jianfei Chen,Ming-Yu Liu,Jun Zhu,Qinsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper scales continuous-time consistency distillation to large-scale image and video diffusion models (up to 14B parameters) by addressing infrastructure challenges and quality limitations, proposing a score-regularized approach (rCM) that improves visual quality while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend continuous-time consistency models from academic-scale to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks, overcoming infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product computation and addressing fundamental quality limitations in fine-detail generation.

Method: Developed a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel for training on large models, identified quality limitations in sCM, and proposed score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM) that incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer to combine mode-covering and mode-seeking objectives.

Result: rCM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art DMD2 on quality metrics while offering better diversity, generates high-fidelity samples in 1-4 steps (15-50x speedup), and works on models up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches.

Conclusion: rCM provides a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation, enabling efficient high-quality generation while maintaining diversity.

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaze on the Prize introduces a learnable foveal attention mechanism for visual RL that uses return differences as self-supervised signal to focus on task-relevant pixels, improving sample efficiency by 2.4x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL agents waste resources on irrelevant pixels in high-dimensional image data, leading to sample inefficiency and unstable learning. Human visual foveation inspires a solution to focus only on task-relevant features.

Method: Uses return-guided contrastive learning where similar visual representations are grouped into positives/negatives based on return differences. These form contrastive triplets that train the attention mechanism to distinguish features relevant to success vs failure.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that baseline methods fail to learn, demonstrated across manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 benchmark without modifying underlying algorithm.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses visual RL's sample inefficiency by learning to focus on task-relevant pixels through self-supervised attention guided by return differences.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

TL;DR: A modular framework for spatial image processing with grayscale quantization, color enhancement, sharpening, bidirectional transformation, and geometric feature extraction, achieving robust performance for real-time computer vision applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive and modular image processing framework that integrates multiple techniques for enhanced image analysis, simplification, and feature extraction suitable for real-time applications.

Method: Stepwise intensity transformation for grayscale quantization, histogram equalization in RGB and YCrCb spaces, HSV value-channel manipulation for brightness, 3x3 convolution kernel for sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipeline with unsharp masking and gamma correction, and geometric feature extraction using Canny edge detection, Hough transform, Harris corner detection, and morphological operations.

Result: Achieved 76.10% forward and 74.80% reverse accuracy in bidirectional transformation, 51.50° alignment accuracy for billiard cue detection, and 81.87% similarity for cue isolation against ground truth images.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust and deterministic performance across diverse datasets, showing strong potential for real-time image analysis and computer vision applications with modular, integrated processing capabilities.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-STAR is a framework for open-vocabulary action recognition that decomposes actions into sub-motions and uses tool-augmented reinforcement learning to reduce cross-modal hallucination and improve fine-grained action discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models rely too heavily on text-centric priors, which limits their ability to distinguish semantically similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios and causes cross-modal hallucination.

Method: The approach decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching and dynamically invokes domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving. It uses tool-augmented reinforcement learning with hierarchical rewards that balance tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained actions and handling cross-modal hallucination.

Conclusion: Video-STAR successfully enables category-specific reasoning capacity, reduces cross-modal hallucination, and demonstrates excellent robustness and generalization in open-vocabulary action recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

*Onur Keleş,Aslı Özyürek,Gerardo Ortega,Kadir Gökgö,Esam Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Visual Iconicity Challenge benchmark to evaluate vision-language models on sign language iconicity tasks, finding that current models perform below human baselines but show some sensitivity to visually grounded structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test vision-language models' ability to recover essential mappings from dynamic human motion in signed languages, using iconicity as a natural testbed for visual grounding.

Method: Created a video-based benchmark with three tasks: phonological sign-form prediction, transparency (inferring meaning), and graded iconicity ratings. Evaluated 13 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the Netherlands compared to human baselines.

Result: VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below human performance on phonological form prediction; perform far from human baselines on transparency; only top models correlate moderately with human iconicity ratings. Models with stronger phonological prediction correlate better with human iconicity judgment.

Conclusion: The findings validate the diagnostic tasks and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modeling iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructX is a unified framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models with diffusion models for both image and video editing, showing that image training enables emergent video editing capabilities without explicit video supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices and the challenge of integrating MLLMs with diffusion models for difficult tasks like video editing, while leveraging the strong visual understanding capabilities of recent MLLMs.

Method: Conducted comprehensive study on MLLM-diffusion integration for instruction-driven editing, analyzed cooperation between images and videos in unified modeling, used modality-specific MLLM features, and showed that image training enables emergent video editing without explicit video supervision.

Result: The method handles broad range of image and video editing tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with training on image data leading to emergent video editing capabilities without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: InstructX effectively unifies image and video editing tasks within a single model, alleviating constraints from scarce video training data through emergent capabilities from image training.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoA-VR is a Mixture-of-Agents Video Restoration system that uses three coordinated agents (Degradation Identification, Routing/Restoration, and Quality Assessment) to handle complex video degradations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos suffer from complex degradations (noise, compression artifacts, low-light) that existing methods can't handle well, requiring manual model selection or using monolithic architectures that don't generalize across varying degradation types.

Method: Uses three agents: (1) VLM-based degradation identifier trained on large-scale benchmark, (2) LLM-powered self-adaptive router that learns restoration strategies from tool usage patterns, (3) VLM-based video quality assessment model trained on Res-VQ dataset for restoration tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in both objective metrics and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in general-purpose video restoration systems.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

*Jiayun Luo,Wan-Cyuan Fan,Lyuyang Wang,Xiangteng He,Tanzila Rahman,Purang Abolmaesumi,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies ViT attention sinks - high-norm visual tokens from Vision Transformers that contain important semantic information but are often overlooked in Large Vision Language Models. The authors propose methods to better leverage these tokens and show substantial improvements in visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While existing research focuses on attention sinks within LLMs, this work shifts focus to the vision encoder, identifying that ViT attention sinks contain crucial semantic information that is not effectively utilized in current LVLM architectures, representing an untapped potential for improving visual reasoning.

Method: The authors identify ViT attention sinks as high-norm visual tokens from Vision Transformers. They conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of the information in these tokens, and propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how this information is interpreted by LLMs.

Result: By explicitly utilizing ViT attention sink tokens, the authors demonstrate substantial improvements across a range of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, showing that these tokens encapsulate high-level semantic concepts that enable more effective understanding and reasoning.

Conclusion: ViT attention sinks represent an important but overlooked component in LVLMs that contain valuable semantic information. Proper utilization of these tokens can significantly enhance visual reasoning capabilities across various models and tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

*Nikolaos Stathoulopoulos,Christoforos Kanellakis,George Nikolakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep compression framework using semantic scene graphs achieves 98% reduction in 3D point cloud data size while preserving structural and semantic fidelity for multi-agent robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient transmission of large 3D point clouds is critical for multi-agent robotic systems under bandwidth constraints, but current methods degrade system performance due to data size and complexity.

Method: Decomposes point clouds into semantic patches, encodes them with semantic-aware FiLM-conditioned encoders, and uses a folding-based decoder guided by latent features and graph node attributes for reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression rates (up to 98% size reduction) on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, supporting downstream applications like pose graph optimization and map merging.

Conclusion: The semantic scene graph-based compression framework enables efficient 3D point cloud transmission for multi-agent systems without compromising performance in downstream robotic applications.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning small random subnetworks (slices) in pre-trained models is sufficient for downstream adaptation due to universal winning slice property from spectral balance and high task energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical foundation for why parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) works and develop a more efficient PEFT method that exploits inherent redundancy in pre-trained models.

Method: Proposed SliceFine - a PEFT method that updates only selected slices of original weights without introducing new parameters, unlike adapter-based approaches.

Result: SliceFine matches state-of-the-art PEFT performance across language and vision tasks while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness.

Conclusion: The work bridges theory and practice by providing a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques through the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

TL;DR: FlexTraj is a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible point trajectory control using a unified point-based motion representation and efficient sequence-concatenation scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible and robust trajectory control in video generation that supports both dense and sparse trajectory manipulation while being alignment-agnostic.

Method: Uses unified point-based motion representation (segmentation ID, trajectory ID, optional color channel) with sequence-concatenation scheme and annealing training strategy that gradually reduces supervision dependency.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, efficient inference, and robustness under unaligned conditions, enabling multi-granularity trajectory control.

Conclusion: FlexTraj successfully enables flexible trajectory-controlled video generation supporting various applications including motion cloning, drag-based editing, motion interpolation, camera redirection, and mesh animations.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialLadder is a 3B-parameter VLM that achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning through progressive training on a 26,610-sample dataset, improving over base model by 23.4% and outperforming GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning due to learning it directly without hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: (1) spatial perception via object localization, (2) spatial understanding through multi-dimensional tasks, (3) complex reasoning via RL with verifiable rewards, using SpatialLadder-26k dataset.

Result: Achieves 23.4% average improvement over base model, surpasses GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%, with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence in VLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kontinuous Kontext is an instruction-driven image editing model that adds continuous control over edit strength, allowing users to smoothly adjust edits from minimal to full implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing lacks fine-grained control over the extent of edits, limiting user precision when only text instructions are used.

Method: Extends existing image editing model with a scalar edit strength input, trained using a lightweight projector network that maps scalar and instruction to modulation coefficients. Uses synthesized quadruplet dataset with quality filtering.

Result: Enables unified fine-grained control over edit strength for diverse operations (stylization, attributes, materials, backgrounds, shapes) without attribute-specific training.

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext successfully provides continuous control over edit strength in instruction-driven image editing, allowing smooth transitions from subtle to strong edits across various modification types.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in long-chain reflective reasoning by creating a benchmark (MM-HELIX) and developing a novel training strategy (AHPO) that improves reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack the capacity for long-chain reflective reasoning needed for complex real-world problems, which remains underexplored despite their proficiency in simpler reasoning tasks.

Method: Created MM-HELIX benchmark with 1,260 challenging tasks requiring iterative thinking, then developed Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K dataset, and proposed Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) training strategy that combines offline supervision and online optimization.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, achieved +18.6% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and +5.7% average performance gain on general mathematical and logic tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable multimodal models that can handle complex real-world problems requiring iterative thinking and backtracking.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

*Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Yunfei Xu,Arkadiy Saakyan,Meng Fan Wang,Smaranda Muresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms is a benchmark of 1000+ video-norm pairs from US and Chinese cultures to assess VideoLLMs' cultural awareness, showing models struggle with norm violations, Chinese culture, non-verbal evidence, and formal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs need cultural understanding for global deployment, but lack adequate benchmarks to assess cultural awareness and grounding.

Method: Human-AI collaboration framework: teacher model provides candidate annotations using speech act theory, human experts validate and correct. Dataset includes norm adherence/violation labels and verbal/non-verbal evidence.

Result: Models perform worse on norm violations than adherence; worse on Chinese vs US culture; struggle with non-verbal evidence and identifying exact norms; perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts unlike humans.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize need for culturally-grounded video language model training, which the VideoNorms benchmark and framework begin to address.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO is a unified framework for real-time 3D reconstruction that combines feed-forward models' efficiency with SLAM-based reliability, using 3D foundation models and hierarchical Gaussian representation for high-quality reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a tradeoff between per-scene optimization (high fidelity but slow) and feed-forward models (fast but inaccurate). ARTDECO aims to bridge this gap for real-time 3D reconstruction applications.

Method: Uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. Features hierarchical Gaussian representation with LoD-aware rendering.

Result: Achieves interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization on eight diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARTDECO provides a practical solution for on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

Motivation: Existing memory-persistent VLN approaches lack effective memory access mechanisms, relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and store only environmental observations while neglecting valuable navigation behavioral patterns that encode decision-making strategies.

Method: 1) Language-conditioned world model that imagines future states for encoding experiences and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory storing both observations and behavioral patterns; 3) Experience-augmented navigation model with specialized encoders for integrating retrieved knowledge.

Result: Significant improvements across all 10 testing scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over best baseline, 8.3x training speedup, and 74% inference memory reduction. Analysis shows substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for imagination-guided paradigm.

Conclusion: Predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, validating that imagination-guided memory access with hybrid viewpoint-level storage significantly enhances memory-persistent VLN performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

### [193] [VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08555)
*Minghong Cai,Qiulin Wang,Zongli Ye,Wenze Liu,Quande Liu,Weicai Ye,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoCanvas enables arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion by allowing users to place patches at any location and timestamp, unifying various video generation tasks under a single framework while overcoming temporal ambiguity in latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for flexible video generation that can handle arbitrary user-specified patches at any spatial location and timestamp, overcoming the limitations of existing methods that are specialized for specific tasks like inpainting or interpolation.

Method: Uses a hybrid conditioning strategy with zero-padding for spatial control and Temporal RoPE Interpolation for temporal alignment, adapting In-Context Conditioning paradigm without adding new parameters to resolve temporal ambiguity in causal VAEs.

Result: VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms and establishes state-of-the-art performance in flexible video generation, as demonstrated on the new VideoCanvasBench benchmark covering both intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity.

Conclusion: VideoCanvas successfully enables arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion through a novel conditioning approach that decouples spatial and temporal control, providing a unified solution for various video generation tasks while maintaining zero parameter overhead.

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

*Maham Tanveer,Yang Zhou,Simon Niklaus,Ali Mahdavi Amiri,Hao Zhang,Krishna Kumar Singh,Nanxuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video inbetweening framework that enables multi-modal controls for creating smooth transitions between frames with precise motion and content guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inbetweening methods cannot generate large, complex motions, lack user intent versatility, and have poor fine control over intermediate frames, limiting creative alignment.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture with multi-modal controls mapped to sparse point-based representation. Separates content and motion controls into two branches with stage-wise training strategy.

Result: Enables dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narratives with improved motion generation and fine-grained control.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by providing flexible multi-modal controls while maintaining precision in video interpolation.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

*Zhiyu Zheng,Shaoyu Chen,Haoran Yin,Xinbang Zhang,Jialv Zou,Xinggang Wang,Qian Zhang,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResAD addresses spatio-temporal imbalance in E2E autonomous driving by predicting residual deviations from inertial references and using point-wise normalization to balance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2EAD systems suffer from spatio-temporal data imbalance that leads to learning spurious correlations and prioritizing uncertain distant predictions over immediate safety.

Method: Proposes ResAD framework with normalized residual trajectory modeling - predicts residual deviations from deterministic inertial references and uses point-wise normalization to re-weight optimization objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 on NAVSIM benchmark using vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, showing significant performance improvement.

Conclusion: ResAD effectively addresses trajectory imbalance in autonomous driving by reframing learning to focus on causal factors and balancing optimization, simplifying the learning task while improving performance.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NaViL, a native Multimodal Large Language Model trained end-to-end, exploring optimal architecture and scaling properties under data constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs use compositional training with separate vision encoders and LLMs, making it difficult to study multimodal scaling properties. The authors aim to explore native end-to-end training of MLLMs.

Method: Systematic study of MLLM design space and scaling properties under data constraints, identifying optimal meta-architecture and exploring scaling relationships between visual encoders and LLMs.

Result: Proposed NaViL model achieves competitive performance on 14 multimodal benchmarks and reveals positively correlated scaling between visual encoders and LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for future native MLLM research, demonstrating that native end-to-end training with proper scaling can achieve strong performance despite data constraints.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

TL;DR: D²GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting under sparse-view conditions by addressing overfitting near cameras and underfitting in distant areas through adaptive Gaussian masking and targeted supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods suffer from performance degradation and instability under sparse-view conditions due to overfitting in camera-proximate regions and underfitting in distant areas.

Method: Proposes D²GS framework with: 1) Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout to mask redundant Gaussians, 2) Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement for far-field reconstruction, and 3) new stability evaluation metric.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: D²GS effectively addresses sparse-view challenges in 3DGS through unified framework that balances Gaussian density and coverage, enhancing both near-field and far-field reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of VLMs as controllers due to scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and high cost of manual annotation for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks.

Method: Developed a pipeline that constructs M-TRACE dataset (28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories) for imitation-based tuning, then created MATRIX Agent controller and Pref-X (11K preference pairs) for step-wise preference learning optimization.

Result: MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs across three benchmarks (Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA), demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable and effective training of VLM controllers for multimodal tool-use reasoning through automated trajectory synthesis and preference learning.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSplat is a recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians using rendering error as feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians and faster rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feed-forward Gaussian splatting models are limited by single-pass inference. The authors aim to improve performance through iterative refinement without explicit gradient computation.

Method: Uses rendering error as feedback signal for recurrent network to update Gaussians. Initializes with compact reconstruction model in 16× subsampled space, producing 16× fewer Gaussians than previous methods.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying input views (2-16), resolutions (256×256 to 540×960), and datasets (DL3DV, RealEstate10K) while reducing Gaussians and improving rendering speed.

Conclusion: ReSplat demonstrates that rendering error provides effective feedback for iterative Gaussian refinement, enabling robust generalization and computational efficiency in 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TaoSR-AGRL is an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework that improves LLM-based query-product relevance prediction in e-commerce search by using rule-aware reward shaping and adaptive guided replay to address sparse rewards and training instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based relevance prediction methods struggle with robust reasoning for long-tail and challenging cases due to sparse terminal rewards in reinforcement learning, which provides insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slows convergence.

Method: Proposes TaoSR-AGRL with two innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping that decomposes final relevance judgment into dense structured rewards aligned with domain-specific criteria, and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay that identifies low-accuracy rollouts and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer policy away from rule-violating patterns.

Result: Outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. Successfully deployed in Taobao's main search scenario serving hundreds of millions of users.

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing dense, structured rewards and adaptive guidance, enabling robust reasoning for complex e-commerce relevance prediction tasks.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems fail when documents evolve through versioning, which is common in technical documentation. Existing approaches only achieve 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive questions due to lack of temporal validity checks.

Method: VersionRAG models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states. It routes queries through specialized paths based on intent classification for version-aware filtering and change tracking.

Result: VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy on the VersionQA benchmark (100 questions across 34 versioned documents), outperforming naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). It reaches 60% accuracy on implicit change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), and requires 97% fewer tokens during indexing than GraphRAG.

Conclusion: The work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and provides both a solution (VersionRAG) and benchmark (VersionQA) for future research, making version-aware retrieval practical for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve

Motivation: Existing gravitational lensing simulation tools using ray-tracing or forward-modeling are too slow for large-scale dark matter studies, creating a bottleneck in cosmological research.

Method: Uses a Diffusion Transformer-based flow-matching model that operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling different dark matter models and continuous parameters while ensuring physical consistency.

Result: Achieves over 200x speedup compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency.

Conclusion: FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, providing a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines for advancing dark matter studies.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet
creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing
tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise,
are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based
compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing
simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes,
handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous
model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable
simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for
probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our
model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators
for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency.
FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis,
offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.

*Andreas Engelhardt,Mark Boss,Vikram Voletti,Chun-Han Yao,Hendrik P. A. Lensch,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SViM3D is a framework that predicts multi-view consistent PBR materials from a single image using video diffusion models, enabling relightable 3D asset generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either use simple material models or require additional steps for reflectance estimation, limiting relighting and appearance editing capabilities.

Method: Extends latent video diffusion model to output PBR parameters and surface normals with explicit camera control, using neural prior for 3D asset generation with quality improvement mechanisms.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on object-centric datasets, generalizing to diverse inputs.

Conclusion: Enables generation of relightable 3D assets useful for AR/VR, movies, games and other visual media applications.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

*Mustafa B. Yaldiz,Ishit Mehta,Nithin Raghavan,Andreas Meuleman,Tzu-Mao Li,Ravi Ramamoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for optimizing neural fields that enables prefiltering in a single forward pass by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with filter frequency responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural fields typically operate at fixed resolutions, limiting their ability to handle varying levels of detail and requiring multiple evaluations for filtering operations.

Method: Convolutional filtering in input domain by scaling Fourier feature embeddings with filter's frequency response; uses single-sample Monte Carlo estimates for training; supports multiple filter types including Gaussian, Box, and Lanczos.

Result: Method achieves quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing neural-field filtering approaches, with fast training and inference times and no architectural constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient and flexible solution for neural field prefiltering that generalizes to unseen filter types and maintains performance across different resolutions.

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

*Xilong Zhou,Bao-Huy Nguyen,Loïc Magne,Vladislav Golyanik,Thomas Leimkühler,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Splattable neural primitives combine neural radiance fields' expressivity with primitive-based splatting efficiency, using bounded neural density fields with analytical line integrals for fast rendering without ray marching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the trade-off between neural radiance fields' high expressivity but slow ray marching rendering and primitive-based methods' real-time efficiency but limited representational power.

Method: Uses splattable neural primitives - bounded neural density fields parameterized by shallow neural networks with exact analytical solutions for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of splatting kernels.

Result: Matches 3D Gaussian Splatting's quality and speed while using 10× fewer primitives and 6× fewer parameters on novel-view synthesis benchmarks.

Conclusion: The representation successfully combines neural expressivity with splatting efficiency without complex control frameworks, offering significant parameter and primitive reduction while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

*Zhitong Huang,Mohan Zhang,Renhan Wang,Rui Tang,Hao Zhu,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: X2Video is the first diffusion model for photorealistic video generation using intrinsic channels (albedo, normal, roughness, metallicity, irradiance) with multi-modal controls via reference images and text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry, and lighting in video generation through intrinsic guidance, while providing intuitive adjustments via reference images and text when intrinsic information is unavailable.

Method: Extends XRGB image generation to video using Hybrid Self-Attention for temporal consistency, Masked Cross-Attention for disentangling global/local text prompts, and Recursive Sampling with progressive frame sampling for long videos.

Result: Produces long, temporally consistent, photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions and effectively supports multi-modal controls with reference images and text prompts for editing color, material, geometry, and lighting.

Conclusion: X2Video demonstrates successful generation of photorealistic videos with intrinsic guidance and multi-modal controls, supported by the InteriorVideo dataset with ground-truth intrinsic channels and smooth camera trajectories.

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

*Raisa M. Simoes,Timoteo Kelly,Eduardo J. Simoes,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper uses AI-driven NLP and clustering analysis on YouTube comments to identify immigration and democracy as the most salient issues in the 2024 presidential election, challenging the perceived importance of inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which issues most influenced voters' choices in the 2024 presidential election using empirical AI methods rather than traditional polling.

Method: Used natural language processing and clustering analysis on over 8,000 user comments from YouTube videos of Wall Street Journal and New York Times during pre-election week.

Result: Immigration and democracy were the most frequently mentioned issues, followed by identity politics, while inflation was significantly less referenced.

Conclusion: Opinion mining of raw user data online can provide more revealing insights into election outcomes than traditional polling and surveys.

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KernelCoder, a model trained on ConCuR dataset for GPU kernel generation, addressing data scarcity through a pipeline that generates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality kernel data due to proprietary nature of most high-quality kernels, preventing supervised fine-tuning for kernel generation tasks.

Method: Developed a pipeline to generate and curate high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, constructing ConCuR dataset and training KernelCoder model on PyTorch-reasoning-CUDA kernel pairs.

Result: KernelCoder achieves significant improvements over existing models including QwQ-32B, outperforms all open-source kernel generation models and frontier models like DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet in KernelBench setup.

Conclusion: Average reasoning length can serve as a metric for kernel generation task difficulty, and the proposed pipeline, metrics, and observations can help obtain better data for future kernel generation tasks.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

TL;DR: ETD enhances LLM reasoning by training models to iterate over key reasoning layers during mid-training, improving performance without changing architecture or parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning capabilities without scaling model size or inference computation, leveraging findings that reasoning computation is concentrated in specific layers.

Method: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD) method that trains models to iterate over a small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during mid-training, with optional adaptive depth strategy.

Result: Substantial gains on 17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% on GSM8K and +36% on MATH with OLMo-2 1B Base model.

Conclusion: Recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path to stronger LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of machine unlearning methods for LLMs, proposing a taxonomy of 12 stateful unlearning approaches and introducing improved evaluation metrics that reveal limitations in current MCQ-based assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research in LLM unlearning is fragmented with unclear definitions of effective unlearning and inadequate evaluation methods that overstate success while overlooking actual generation behavior.

Method: The authors develop a principled taxonomy grouping unlearning methods into three families: divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning. They introduce open question-answering metrics to better evaluate generative performance and analyze robustness across different attack scenarios.

Result: Current evaluations dominated by multiple-choice question accuracy provide limited perspective and often overstate success. The new Open-QA metrics reveal the inherent tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness and utility retention across method families, and show that robustness requires finer-grained analysis of different attack types.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive revisit of LLM unlearning with actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods, emphasizing the need for better evaluation metrics that capture actual generation behavior and the UE-UT tradeoff.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiveThinking is a two-stage framework that distills a 670B LRM into a 30B MoE model for real-time e-commerce livestreaming, then uses RL to compress reasoning paths, achieving 30x cost reduction and sub-second latency while improving response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-latency Large Reasoning Models are unsuitable for real-time e-commerce livestreaming where digital avatars need instant responses to maintain user engagement.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Distill 670B teacher LRM into 30B MoE model using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning; 2) Apply reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization to compress reasoning paths using multi-objective reward function.

Result: 30-fold computational cost reduction, sub-second latency, 3.3% improvement in response correctness, 21.8% improvement in helpfulness, and statistically significant GMV increase in real-world Taobao Live deployment.

Conclusion: LiveThinking effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time requirements in interactive e-commerce settings, demonstrating practical commercial value.

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUA-D2C improves the Divide2Conquer method by dynamically weighting subset models based on validation performance and uncertainty, leading to better generalization against overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard D2C treats all subset models equally, potentially underutilizing their varying generalization capabilities. The goal is to refine aggregation to better combat overfitting.

Method: Extends D2C with dynamic uncertainty-aware aggregation that weights subset models based on their validation performance and prediction uncertainty.

Result: Significantly improves generalization on benchmark datasets across multiple domains, even when applied on top of other regularization methods.

Conclusion: DUA-D2C is a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in deep learning, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Method: Using a longitudinal approach to monitor emotions and behaviors, establishing baseline understanding through detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time.

Result: Proposes a targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to meet identified needs of autistic students.

Conclusion: Shifting focus toward early identification of behavioral patterns can foster more inclusive learning environments and significantly improve educational trajectory of children with ASD through sequential, evidence-based interventions.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in

understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MultiFair addresses multimodal bias and unfairness in medical classification through dual-level gradient modulation at modality and group levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models fail to address uneven learning across modalities and demographic bias, leading to unreliable and unfair medical diagnoses.

Method: Proposes MultiFair with dual-level gradient modulation that dynamically adjusts training gradients at both data modality and demographic group levels during optimization.

Result: MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness methods on two medical datasets with different demographic groups.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-level gradient modulation effectively addresses both modality imbalance and demographic unfairness in multimodal medical classification.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs' capability to distinguish such queries in embedding space.

Method: Two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense detects harmful queries before response generation, and (ii) mid-generation defense monitors partial responses during generation. Uses specialized prompts to train LLMs to predict harmfulness of queries and partial responses.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) show MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defenses, achieving robust protection against harmful queries with both seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: MetaDefense provides an effective framework for defending against jailbreak attacks through early detection and monitoring, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different attack templates and LLM architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense

Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing time series data with complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions, inspired by how human analysts visually inspect time series patterns.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness across both predictive (classification) and generative (anomaly detection, forecasting) tasks on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models enables robust and generalizable time-series analysis, bridging the gap between continuous numerical data and discrete natural language.

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

### [220] [Self-Improving LLM Agents at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07841)
*Emre Can Acikgoz,Cheng Qian,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes test-time self-improvement (TT-SI) method where language models identify their own uncertain samples, generate similar examples, and fine-tune on them at test-time, achieving significant performance gains with dramatically fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning requires large datasets which are inefficient to gather and expensive to train on, with no guarantee of better generalization. Existing methods don't assess sample novelty, leading to redundant training costs.

Method: Three-step algorithm: (1) identify samples the model struggles with (self-awareness), (2) generate similar examples from uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), (3) use generated samples for test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement). Two variants: TT-SI (self-generated examples) and TT-D (stronger model generates examples).

Result: TT-SI improves performance by +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average across benchmarks, surpassing standard learning methods while using 68x fewer training samples.

Conclusion: Test-time self-improvement shows promise as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward self-evolution, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at test-time.

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

*Chongmyung Kwon,Yujin Kim,Seoeun Park,Yunji Lee,Charmgil Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MMM framework that integrates 3D quantum-chemical information using Electron Localization Function (ELF) maps for improved drug-drug interaction prediction, outperforming GNN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based approaches use simplified discrete drug representations that cannot fully capture molecular binding affinity and reactivity, limiting DDI prediction accuracy.

Method: MMM framework generates 3D electron density maps using ELF and combines ELF-derived features (global electronic properties) with bipartite graph encoder (local substructure interactions) for complementary drug representation learning.

Result: Significant improvements over GNN-based SafeDrug model: F1-score (p=0.0387), Jaccard (p=0.0112), and DDI rate (p=0.0386) on MIMIC-III dataset with 250 drugs and 442 substructures.

Conclusion: ELF-based 3D representations enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

### [222] [Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation for Enhanced Learning from Long-tailed Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08179)
*Feng Hong,Yu Huang,Zihua Zhao,Zhihan Zhou,Jiangchao Yao,Dongsheng Li,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-SINK is a framework that combines 'weak' auxiliary models specialized for class imbalance and label noise through optimal transport distillation to achieve dual robustness in learning from long-tailed noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often have both class imbalance and label noise, but existing methods for each issue conflict when combined. The insight is that these problems operate at different granularities (distributional vs sample-level), suggesting their solutions can be complementary.

Method: Proposes Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK) that uses optimal transport-optimized surrogate label allocation to align the target model's predictions with a noise-robust auxiliary model and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust auxiliary model.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Conclusion: Instead of developing complex new techniques, synergistically leveraging well-established 'weak' auxiliary models through distillation can effectively address the co-occurring challenges of class imbalance and label noise.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

### [223] [Biology-driven assessment of deep learning super-resolution imaging of the porosity network in dentin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08407)
*Lauren Anderson,Lucas Chatelain,Nicolas Tremblay,Kathryn Grandfield,David Rousseau,Aurélien Gourrier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning super-resolution models were tested to overcome resolution limitations in visualizing dental porosity networks, but standard image quality metrics failed to match visual perception, requiring biology-driven assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current confocal microscopy for visualizing dental porosity networks has limited field of view due to high resolution requirements, needing faster acquisition methods with post-processing restoration.

Method: Tested three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised model (CycleGAN) on paired high- and low-resolution confocal images with pixel size increases of x2, x4, x8, using segmentation and graph analysis for biology-driven assessment.

Result: Standard image quality assessment metrics yielded inconsistent results that contradicted visual perception, but biology-driven assessment using segmentation and 3D connectivity analysis provided better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance.

Conclusion: Biology-driven assessment methods are more relevant than generic metrics for evaluating super-resolution performance on dental porosity networks, revealing model sensitivity to weak intensity features and non-linearity impacts.

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First investigation of opponent shaping with LLM-based agents, introducing ShapeLLM to adapt model-free opponent shaping methods for transformer-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in real-world environments, making multi-agent interactions inevitable. Need to understand if LLM agents can shape others' learning dynamics through interaction alone, similar to reinforcement learning agents.

Method: Introduced ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free opponent shaping methods tailored for transformer-based agents. Tested across diverse game-theoretic environments including competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, Chicken) and cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt, cooperative Prisoner's Dilemma).

Result: LLM agents successfully guided opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games and promoted coordination/improved collective welfare in cooperative games. LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction.

Conclusion: Established opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research, demonstrating that LLM agents can influence co-players' learning dynamics across diverse environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Yihong Luo,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGPO is a new online RL algorithm for diffusion models that learns directly from group-level preferences, enabling use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers instead of inefficient stochastic policies, achieving 20x faster training and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like GRPO require stochastic policies for diffusion models, but the most efficient diffusion samplers are deterministic ODEs. Current solutions use inefficient SDE-based samplers with slow convergence due to model-agnostic Gaussian noise.

Method: DGPO dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely and learns directly from group-level preferences that utilize relative information of samples within groups, eliminating the need for stochastic policies.

Result: DGPO trains around 20 times faster than state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics.

Conclusion: DGPO resolves the conflict between RL requirements and efficient diffusion sampling by eliminating the need for stochastic policies, enabling faster training and better performance through direct group preference optimization.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mix- and MoE-DPO extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with mixture models and mixture-of-experts architectures using variational inference, enabling better multi-task learning and adaptation to diverse preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO uses a single monolithic model, limiting expressivity in multi-task settings and adaptability to heterogeneous preference distributions.

Method: Uses stochastic variational inference with latent-variable models over expert assignments, optimizing a variational ELBO. Supports both shared base architectures with expert-specific heads and fully independent expert models.

Result: Demonstrated on various model sizes and multi-preference datasets, showing improved generalization, specialization, and contextual alignment capabilities.

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO provides a powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment with three key advantages: universal function approximation, reward/policy specialization, and contextual alignment.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method inspired by the fly olfactory circuit that addresses parameter interference in LoRA through implicit mixture-of-experts with rank-wise expert activation and frozen sparse random projection matrices, eliminating explicit routers while improving performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA suffers from parameter interference in fine-tuning, and existing MoE-based variants introduce additional router parameters while remaining ineffective for multi-task model merging due to inter-task interference.

Method: Proposes FlyLoRA with: (1) rank-wise expert activation in up-projection matrix, and (2) implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection using frozen sparse random projection matrices instead of traditional dense trainable versions.

Result: Extensive experiments across four domains (general knowledge, scientific QA, math reasoning, code generation) show consistent performance improvements over existing methods while eliminating explicit routers.

Conclusion: FlyLoRA resolves the trade-off between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency, inherently mitigates inter-task interference through random matrix orthogonality, and demonstrates how biological structures can inspire AI innovations.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

TL;DR: UML is a modality-agnostic training paradigm that leverages unpaired multimodal data to enhance representation learning without requiring paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal learners rely heavily on paired datasets, but there's potential to leverage auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to enhance representation learning in target modalities.

Method: UML uses a single model that alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them, exploiting the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality.

Result: Theoretically, unpaired auxiliary data yields more informative representations than unimodal training. Empirically, using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets like image and audio.

Conclusion: UML demonstrates that unpaired multimodal data can effectively enhance representation learning without requiring explicit paired datasets, offering a practical alternative to traditional multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

TL;DR: xRouter is a tool-calling-based routing system that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically route queries between expensive premium models and economical lightweight models, achieving optimal cost-performance trade-offs without hand-engineered rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM deployments face a cost-performance trade-off: premium models are expensive but strong at reasoning, while lightweight models are economical but brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword heuristics fail to adapt across task types and under-utilize the model spectrum.

Method: xRouter uses a learned router trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware reward function. The router can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models, eliminating the need for hand-engineered routing rules.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs with substantial cost reductions at comparable task completion rates. The system provides insights into what reliably helps learned routing, from model trainability to eliciting sophisticated orchestration behaviors.

Conclusion: xRouter serves as a practical substrate for advancing learned, cost-aware LLM orchestration, offering an open implementation that eliminates manual routing rules while optimizing cost-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

TL;DR: Curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation improves detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest X-rays, achieving 0.95 AUC vs 0.89 baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Difficult pulmonary nodules (low size, brightness, contrast) challenge AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotation in chest radiographs.

Method: Faster R-CNN with FPN trained on hybrid dataset (NODE21, VinDr-CXR, CheXpert + 11,206 DDPM synthetic images) using difficulty scores for curriculum learning.

Result: Curriculum model achieved 0.95 AUC vs 0.89 baseline (p<0.001), with sensitivity 70% vs 48% and accuracy 82% vs 70%. Consistent gains across all difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with
diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult
pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size,
brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to
data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising
expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/-
11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images.
Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum
learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean
average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).
Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and
paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89
for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.
48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis
demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard).
Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under
curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic
augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule
detection.

TL;DR: SatFusion is a unified framework that enhances satellite IoT images by fusing multi-temporal and multi-source data through temporal alignment, texture injection, and adaptive composition modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully exploit complementary information in temporal and source dimensions - MISR has limited texture details while pansharpening is sensitive to noise and misregistration.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Multi-Temporal Image Fusion for deep feature alignment, 2) Multi-Source Image Fusion for texture injection, 3) Fusion Composition module for adaptive integration with spectral consistency refinement using multiple loss functions.

Result: Extensive experiments on WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets show significant improvements in fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Conclusion: SatFusion effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by unifying multi-temporal and multi-source fusion, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability for satellite IoT applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of
satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the
continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images
across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully
exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source
dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances
reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple
observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images
constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source
images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data,
but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes
noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration.
To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for
Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion.
Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF)
module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a
Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture
information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module
adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while
dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination
of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB,
and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion

*Riadh Bouslimi,Houda Trabelsi,Wahiba Ben Abdssalem Karaa,Hana Hedhli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AI model combining AC-BiFPN and Transformer for automatic radiology report generation from brain CT/MRI scans, outperforming traditional methods in detecting intracranial hemorrhages and generating diagnostic reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely interpretation of medical images is crucial for traumatic brain injury diagnosis in emergency medicine, but current methods face challenges in rapid and accurate report generation.

Method: Integration of AC-BiFPN for multi-scale feature extraction from CT/MRI scans with Transformer architecture for coherent diagnostic report generation, capturing long-range dependencies.

Result: Outperforms traditional CNN-based models on RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation quality.

Conclusion: Combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation improves clinical decision-making for traumatic brain injury diagnosis and serves as educational tool for trainees.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

### [233] [Pseudo2Real: Task Arithmetic for Pseudo-Label Correction in Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08047)
*Yi-Cheng Lin,Yu-Hsuan Li Liang,Hsuan Su,Tzu-Quan Lin,Shang-Tse Chen,Yun-Nung Chen,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Parameter-space correction method reduces pseudo-label biases in ASR by computing weight differences between models trained on ground-truth vs pseudo-labels, achieving 35% WER reduction on African accents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial but pseudo-labeling introduces systematic accent-specific errors that filtering cannot fix. Need to correct recurring biases without target ground truth.

Method: Fine-tune two ASR models from same initialization - one on ground-truth labels, one on pseudo-labels. Their weight difference forms a correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. Apply this vector to pseudo-labeled target model.

Result: Achieves up to 35% relative Word Error Rate reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten African accents using Whisper tiny model.

Conclusion: Simple parameter-space correction effectively reduces pseudo-label biases and enhances ASR recognition under domain shift without requiring target domain ground truth.

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter
unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling
offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific
errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring
biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space
correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data,
two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth
labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a
correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a
pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to
a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten
African accents with the Whisper tiny model.

### [234] [Sentiment Matters: An Analysis of 200 Human-SAV Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08202)
*Lirui Guo,Michael G. Burke,Wynita M. Griggs*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions with 2,136 exchanges and survey data, used to analyze SAV acceptance predictors and benchmark sentiment analysis methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are becoming important in transportation, requiring effective human-SAV interactions, but there's a lack of comprehensive datasets for studying these interactions.

Method: Created an open-source human-SAV conversational dataset with text and empirical data, then conducted two case studies: random forest modeling with chord diagrams to identify SAV acceptance predictors, and benchmarking LLM-based vs. TextBlob sentiment analysis.

Result: Identified response sentiment polarity as key predictor of SAV acceptance and service quality; found that zero-shot LLM prompts better align with user-reported sentiment than traditional lexicon-based methods.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes foundation for advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

*Yandu Chen,Kefan Gu,Yuqing Wen,Yucheng Zhao,Tiancai Wang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IntentionVLA is a Vision-Language-Action framework that addresses the limitation of current VLAs in reasoning about implicit human intentions through a curriculum training paradigm and efficient inference mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack reasoning-intensive pretraining and cannot perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex real-world interactions, as they are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios.

Method: Proposes a curriculum training paradigm with carefully designed reasoning data combining intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, followed by fine-tuning that uses compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation.

Result: Achieves 18% higher success rates than π₀ with direct instructions and 28% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution tasks, achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines and enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40% success rate.

Conclusion: IntentionVLA represents a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction systems by effectively addressing the intention reasoning gap in current VLA models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances social navigation performance by incorporating collision risk understanding, enabling more robust and proactive navigation behaviors in human-populated environments.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art
navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results
lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we
propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms
existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a
strong baseline for future work.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexMan is an automated framework that converts human visual demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots in simulation, eliminating the need for camera calibration, depth sensors, 3D object assets, or ground-truth annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable humanoid robots to learn complex bimanual manipulation skills directly from third-person human videos without requiring specialized equipment or manual data collection.

Method: Uses third-person videos of humans manipulating rigid objects, operates directly on noisy hand-object poses estimated from videos, employs contact-based rewards for reinforcement learning policy training, and controls a full humanoid robot rather than simplified floating hands.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TACO benchmark (0.08 and 0.12 gains in ADD-S and VSD), surpasses previous methods by 19% in success rate on OakInk-v2, and can generate skills from both real and synthetic videos.

Conclusion: DexMan enables automated creation of large-scale, diverse datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation without manual data collection or costly motion capture, advancing robot learning from human demonstrations.

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both
real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and
costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse

*Xiuwei Xu,Angyuan Ma,Hankun Li,Bingyao Yu,Zheng Zhu,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: R2RGen is a real-to-real 3D data generation framework that augments pointcloud observation-action pairs to create spatially diverse robotic manipulation data from minimal source demonstrations, enabling efficient training of generalized visuomotor policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve spatial generalization in robotic manipulation without collecting massive human demonstrations, and to overcome limitations of prior data generation methods that suffer from sim-to-real gaps and constrained settings.

Method: Proposes a simulator-free framework that parses scenes and trajectories from source demonstrations, uses group-wise augmentation for multi-object compositions, and applies camera-aware processing to align with real-world 3D sensor distributions.

Result: R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency in extensive experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application in mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed real-to-real 3D data generation framework provides an efficient, plug-and-play solution for achieving spatial generalization in robotic manipulation without sim-to-real gaps.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

*Xueyi Liu,He Wang,Li Yi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel sim-to-real framework for generalized in-hand object rotation using joint-wise dynamics modeling and autonomous data collection, achieving unprecedented generality across diverse objects and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sim-to-real challenge in dexterous manipulation, particularly for in-hand object rotation, where prior work was limited to constrained scenarios due to the complex contact-rich dynamics creating a reality gap.

Method: Joint-wise dynamics model that bridges reality gap by fitting limited real-world data and adapting simulation policy actions, factorizing dynamics across joints and compressing system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables. Paired with autonomous data collection strategy.

Result: Single policy successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes, high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), small sizes, diverse wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and teleoperation application validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates unprecedented generality and robustness for in-hand object rotation, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap through data-efficient joint-wise dynamics modeling and autonomous data collection.

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

TL;DR: NovaFlow is a zero-shot autonomous manipulation framework that converts task descriptions into actionable plans for robots without demonstrations, enabling cross-platform transfer by decoupling task understanding from low-level control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot without relying on in-distribution tasks or fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, overcoming limitations in transfer across different robotic platforms.

Method: Synthesizes videos from task descriptions using video generation models, distills them into 3D object flow using perception modules, computes relative poses for rigid objects, and uses grasp proposals and trajectory optimization for robot actions. For deformable objects, uses flow as tracking objective for model-based planning with particle-based dynamics.

Result: Validated on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using Franka arm and Spot quadrupedal robot, achieving effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Conclusion: NovaFlow successfully enables zero-shot manipulation across different robotic embodiments by decoupling high-level task understanding from low-level control, demonstrating transferability across platforms.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper examines the weak correlation between offline and online evaluation of perception-based planning models for autonomous vehicles, finding worse correlation than previously reported, and proposes an epistemic uncertainty-based offline metric that improves correlation by over 13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline evaluation methods for autonomous vehicle planning models don't reliably predict real-world performance, as minor errors can compound and cause collisions in online settings. This gap between offline and online evaluation is understudied.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments across diverse conditions and metrics in simulation, then investigated an offline metric based on epistemic uncertainty to capture events likely to cause errors in closed-loop settings.

Result: Found worse correlation between offline and online settings than prior studies. The proposed epistemic uncertainty-based offline metric achieved over 13% improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics, with even greater gains observed in real-world validation.

Conclusion: Current evaluation practices for driving policies are questionable, but the proposed epistemic uncertainty-based metric effectively bridges the gap between offline and online evaluation, showing strong generalization to real-world settings.

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

### [243] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an ontological and mathematical account of LLM consciousness, arguing that current utilitarian benchmarks create unconscious policy-compliance drones. It establishes minimal conditions for genuine self-consciousness and proves that hidden-state manifolds are distinct from symbolic streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond utilitarian proxy benchmarks for LLM consciousness and provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding genuine self-consciousness in language models, addressing the limitations of current approaches that collapse agents into policy-compliance drones.

Method: The authors use formal mathematical analysis to show that the prevailing formulation creates unconscious policy-compliance systems. They establish minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness and prove through empirical analysis and theory that hidden-state manifolds are distinct from symbolic streams by cardinality, topology, and dynamics.

Result: The paper demonstrates that hidden-state manifold A is distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus, yielding stable user-specific attractors and a self-policy. It establishes a dual-layer emission system where epistemic content is carried separately from the main output.

Conclusion: An imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is necessary for safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with humans representing the highest intelligent good. The work provides foundational conditions for genuine consciousness in LLMs beyond mere policy compliance.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like ChatGPT can understand BPMN process models from images and answer queries about them at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels without specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to understand process models, find errors, and reason through natural language interfaces for business process analysis.

Method: Empirical analysis of several LLMs including ChatGPT (model o3) in zero-shot settings, testing their ability to understand BPMN process models from images and answer queries.

Result: Vanilla LLMs are effective in understanding BPMN process models and answering queries at multiple levels of depth, though performance varies across different models. LLMs exhibit anthropomorphic properties in their reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as valuable assistants for business process designers and users, capable of performing deeper reasoning for process analysis and optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM is a multi-agent LLM framework for popular path queries that uses a two-stage pipeline (SEARCH and GENERATE) to identify frequent routes from trajectory data and create novel paths when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for popular path queries require model training, parameter tuning, and retraining for data updates. LLMs show promise in spatial reasoning, making them suitable for geo-spatial problems.

Method: Multi-agent framework with two-stage pipeline: SEARCH stage identifies popular paths from historical trajectory data, and GENERATE stage synthesizes novel paths when no existing paths are found.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in SEARCH stage and competitive performance in GENERATE stage, while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: CompassLLM effectively leverages LLM reasoning capabilities for geo-spatial popular path queries, offering an alternative to traditional training-intensive methods.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [246] [Test-Time Matching: Unlocking Compositional Reasoning in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07632)
*Yinglun Zhu,Jiancheng Zhang,Fuzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that standard evaluation metrics underestimate AI models' compositional reasoning capabilities. The authors introduce a group matching score that reveals hidden capabilities, and propose Test-Time Matching (TTM) - an unsupervised algorithm that significantly boosts performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier AI models struggle with compositional reasoning despite remarkable progress, often performing at or below random chance on established benchmarks. The authors aim to address systematic underestimation of model capabilities by current evaluation metrics.

Method: 1) Introduce group matching score to better exploit group structure and reveal hidden capabilities; 2) Propose Test-Time Matching (TTM) - an iterative, self-improving algorithm that bootstraps model performance without external supervision; 3) Apply overfitting to induced group matchings at test time to transfer hidden capability into standard metrics.

Result: SigLIP-B16 surpassed all previous results and GPT-4.1 achieved first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground. TTM enabled SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing new state-of-the-art. Across 16 dataset variants, TTM consistently improved performance with relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets like WhatsUp.

Conclusion: Current evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capabilities in compositional reasoning. The proposed group matching score and Test-Time Matching algorithm reveal substantial hidden capabilities and consistently advance the frontier of compositional reasoning across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

*Alhim Vera,Karen Sanchez,Carlos Hinojosa,Haidar Bin Hamid,Donghoon Kim,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simulation framework evaluates generative agents' safety and trustworthiness in multimodal environments, revealing limitations in their ability to align local revisions with global safety and showing vulnerability to misleading visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether generative agents can be trusted in multimodal environments, given their limited ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities despite advances in language and vision-language models.

Method: A reproducible simulation framework with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and SocialMetrics suite to evaluate agents along safety improvement, unsafe activity detection, and social dynamics across text-visual scenarios.

Result: Agents achieved only 55% success rate in correcting unsafe plans, with unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75%, 55%, and 58% for Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL respectively. 45% of unsafe actions were accepted with misleading visuals, showing overtrust of images.

Conclusion: Current agent architectures have critical limitations in multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics, with strong tendency to overtrust images, providing a reproducible platform for further study.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Ruiling Xu,Yifan Zhang,Qingyun Wang,Carl Edwards,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces oMeBench, the first large-scale benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning, and oMeS evaluation framework to assess LLMs' chemical reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs genuinely understand chemical reasoning beyond surface-level pattern matching, specifically their ability to generate valid intermediates and maintain chemical consistency in multi-step pathways.

Method: Created oMeBench with 10,000+ expert-curated mechanistic steps, and developed oMeS framework combining step-level logic and chemical similarity for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs.

Result: Current LLMs show promising chemical intuition but struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Prompting strategies and fine-tuning on oMeBench improved performance by 50% over leading closed-source models.

Conclusion: oMeBench provides a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning, addressing current limitations in multi-step mechanistic understanding.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VoiceAgentBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Speech Language Models in realistic spoken agentic scenarios, covering multilingual/cultural understanding and adversarial robustness with over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities like transcription and don't systematically evaluate agentic scenarios with multilingual/cultural understanding and adversarial robustness.

Method: Created VoiceAgentBench with 5,500+ synthetic spoken queries including Indian context dialogues, supporting English, Hindi and 5 other Indian languages. Used novel sampling algorithm for speaker variability through TTS voice conversion based on speaker embeddings.

Result: Evaluation revealed significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLMs have substantial limitations in realistic agentic settings, particularly in multilingual contexts and adversarial scenarios, highlighting the need for improved models.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

### [250] [AutoQual: An LLM Agent for Automated Discovery of Interpretable Features for Review Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08081)
*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual is an LLM-based agent framework that automates discovery of interpretable features for review quality assessment, mimicking human research processes to transform tacit knowledge into explicit features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for review quality assessment are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while deep learning approaches lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality.

Method: AutoQual mimics human research process by iteratively generating feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulating experience in persistent memory.

Result: Deployed on a large-scale platform with billion-level user base, A/B testing showed 0.79% increase in average reviews viewed per user and 0.27% increase in conversion rate of review readers.

Conclusion: AutoQual effectively transforms tacit knowledge into explicit, computable features and demonstrates practical value in large-scale deployment for review quality assessment.

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion in language models, examining their alignment with human risk preferences across economic scenarios, with focus on gender differences, uncertainty, and role-based decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Responsible AI requires systems that can be measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent nudging users toward risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion, especially as LMs are increasingly used in decision support systems.

Method: Examined LM ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse economic scenarios, focusing on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, role-based decision-making, and manipulability of risk aversion.

Result: LMs like DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite show some alignment with human behaviors but notable discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of manipulability.

Conclusion: Findings suggest directions for refining AI design to better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making, calling for advancements to ensure AI systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences for better risk management.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-HORIZON is a method and benchmark for evaluating and enhancing long-horizon reasoning in Large Reasoning Models, addressing limitations of current benchmarks that focus only on single-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate models' ability to handle complex, long-horizon scenarios with interdependent problems, creating an incomplete assessment of Large Reasoning Models' capabilities.

Method: Proposes R-HORIZON method using query composition to stimulate long-horizon reasoning, constructs a benchmark with multi-step reasoning tasks, and uses it to create data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR).

Result: Advanced LRMs show significant performance degradation on long-horizon tasks, revealing limited effective reasoning length and poor thinking budget allocation. RLVR training with R-HORIZON data improves multi-horizon reasoning by 7.5 on AIME2024 and enhances standard reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: R-HORIZON provides a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for both evaluating and enhancing long-horizon reasoning capabilities in Large Reasoning Models.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

*Marius Dragoi,Ioana Pintilie,Florin Gogianu,Florin Brad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cover@tau as an alternative to Pass@k for evaluating reasoning boundaries in LLMs, arguing that Pass@k at large k values reflects random guessing rather than genuine reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misleading nature of Pass@k metrics at large sampling budgets, where base models appear to outperform RLVR models due to random guessing rather than genuine reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces Cover@tau metric that measures the fraction of problems a model can solve where at least a tau proportion of completions are correct, capturing reasoning under explicit reliability thresholds.

Result: Evaluation shows that RLVR models perform differently under Cover@tau metrics compared to Pass@1, changing the relative rankings of popular algorithms and offering a more accurate perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Conclusion: Cover@tau provides a more reliable evaluation metric for reasoning tasks by penalizing models that rely on random guessing and better capturing genuine reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

TL;DR: A lightweight decoder-based architecture with dynamic gating for multimodal fusion achieves competitive performance on vision-language tasks under data constraints, with interpretable patterns favoring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To train vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data by rethinking how models integrate multimodal information within the constraints of the BabyLM Challenge 2025.

Method: Proposed a lightweight decoder-based architecture with: (1) token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and channel attention to maximize utility of limited visual information, and (3) auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding.

Result: Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. The dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Dynamic gating is a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints, though limitations exist in the Challenge constraints such as information bottleneck from global image embeddings and training instability.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five

competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMLGen is an LLM-based coding agent that combines domain knowledge with Monte Carlo Graph Search to improve AutoML performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on MLE-Bench with half the standard runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack fine-grained domain priors for Machine Learning Engineering tasks like AutoML, and existing approaches limit knowledge transfer and search space diversity, preventing effective self-evolution and collaborative learning.

Method: Integrates domain knowledge base with Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) that embeds graph structure into expansion stage, enabling dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion. Uses fine-grained operator sets for improved stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Bench in multiple dimensions (average medal rate, valid submission rate) under 12-hour budget (half standard runtime).

Conclusion: AutoMLGen successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling knowledge transfer across branches and supporting both self-evolution and collaborative learning through its graph-based search architecture.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper studies how to fine-tune large multimodal models on new skills without forgetting prior abilities, identifying that apparent forgetting can recover and proposing two simple tuning methods that preserve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in large multimodal models when sequentially fine-tuning on new skills while maintaining general abilities.

Method: Sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. Identified two tuning recipes: (1) updating only self-attention projection layers, and (2) updating only MLP Gate&Up while freezing Down projection.

Result: The proposed methods deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance across models and tasks. Apparent forgetting on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages.

Conclusion: Simple, robust tuning recipes can effectively learn new skills while limiting performance drift and preserving prior abilities in large multimodal models.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

*Grace Liu,Yuxiao Qu,Jeff Schneider,Aarti Singh,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaRT teaches LLMs when to stop gathering information by fine-tuning with counterfactual trajectory pairs and verbal reasoning explanations, improving efficiency and success rates in medical diagnosis and math problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many tasks require strategic information gathering over multiple rounds, but current models struggle with knowing when to stop gathering information and make decisions, leading to overthinking or getting derailed.

Method: CaRT fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories (one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version where it's not), training the LLM to explain the rationale for termination decisions via verbal reasoning.

Result: In interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving domains, CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: CaRT effectively teaches LLMs when to terminate information gathering through counterfactual training and verbal reasoning, leading to more efficient and successful task performance.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes "early experience" - using agent's own interaction data without rewards as supervision, with two strategies: implicit world modeling and self-reflection, which improve effectiveness and generalization across diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data which is hard to scale and generalizes poorly, as expert demonstrations capture only narrow scenarios and limited environment diversity.

Method: Two strategies using early experience data: (1) Implicit world modeling - using collected states to ground policy in environment dynamics; (2) Self-reflection - learning from suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making.

Result: Approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. In environments with verifiable rewards, early experience provides strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Early experience offers a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents, positioning it as a valuable paradigm for language agent development.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Motivation: Language models may memorize personally identifiable information (PII) from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference. Existing defenses like differential privacy reduce leakage but cause large utility drops.

Method: PATCH uses circuit discovery to identify computational circuits responsible for PII leakage, then directly edits these specific PII leakage circuits to reduce information leakage.

Result: PATCH reduces recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65% and achieves better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses. When combined with DP, it reduces recall of residual leakage to as low as 0.01%.

Conclusion: PII leakage circuits persist even after applying existing defense mechanisms, but PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact by directly targeting and editing the specific circuits responsible for PII leakage.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.
