Extensive\nexperiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and\nan F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept\ndetection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1).

In this study, we present\nDoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch\nnormalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain\ngeneralization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale\nfull-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly\nintroduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a\nsystematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nOur results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain\ndependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the\nsame domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain\nshift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully\nconnected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We\nfurther integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,\nyielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can\nbe readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse\nclinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and\ngeneralizable mammography classification systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "DoSReMC is a batch normalization adaptation framework that improves cross-domain generalization for mammography cancer classification by fine-tuning only BN and FC layers while preserving pretrained convolutional filters, addressing domain shift issues in AI deployment.", "motivation": "Deep learning models for breast cancer recognition suffer performance degradation when applied to different domains due to domain shift, limiting safe and equitable AI deployment in clinical settings.", "method": "Proposes DoSReMC framework that fine-tunes only batch normalization and fully connected layers while preserving pretrained convolutional filters, combined with adversarial training for enhanced cross-domain generalization.", "result": "Demonstrates that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence and shows significant improvements in cross-domain generalizability using three large-scale FFDM datasets including a new pathologically confirmed in-house dataset.", "conclusion": "DoSReMC provides a practical pathway for robust and generalizable mammography classification systems that can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines across diverse clinical environments."}}
