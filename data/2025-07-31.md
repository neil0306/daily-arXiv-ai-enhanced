### [1] [IndoPref: A Multi-Domain Pairwise Preference Dataset for Indonesian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22159)
*Vanessa Rebecca Wiyono,David Anugraha,Ayu Purwarianti,Genta Indra Winata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IndoPref, the first human-authored Indonesian preference dataset for evaluating LLM-generated text, addressing underrepresentation in multilingual research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indonesian is underrepresented in LLM preference research, and existing datasets lack cultural authenticity due to English translations.

Method: IndoPref is a fully human-authored, multi-domain dataset with native Indonesian annotations, evaluated using Krippendorff's alpha for inter-annotator agreement.

Result: The dataset shows strong inter-annotator agreement and benchmarks multiple LLMs for output quality.

Conclusion: IndoPref fills a critical gap in Indonesian LLM research, providing culturally authentic data for evaluating text naturalness and quality.

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

### [2] [Persona-Augmented Benchmarking: Evaluating LLMs Across Diverse Writing Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22168)
*Kimberly Le Truong,Riccardo Fogliato,Hoda Heidari,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLM benchmarks lack writing style diversity, potentially leading to brittle performance. This study tests this by rewriting prompts with diverse styles, showing significant performance impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs often lack diversity in writing styles, which may not fully capture human communication patterns, leading to potential performance brittleness in non-standard inputs.

Method: The study rewrites evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting to emulate diverse writing styles, testing performance impacts.

Result: Variations in writing style and prompt formatting significantly affect LLM performance, with certain styles consistently triggering high or low performance across models and tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable method to enhance benchmarks, improving their validity for assessing LLM performance across linguistic variations.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

### [3] [A Scalable Pipeline for Estimating Verb Frame Frequencies Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22187)
*Adam M. Morgan,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated pipeline using LLMs estimates Verb Frame Frequencies (VFFs) more accurately and scalably than existing tools, outperforming syntactic parsers and requiring fewer resources than manual parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for calculating VFFs are limited in scale, accuracy, or accessibility, hindering research in syntax for human and machine language systems.

Method: The pipeline uses LLMs to generate a corpus of sentences with 476 English verbs and instructs an LLM to analyze their syntactic structure, mimicking an expert linguist.

Result: The LLM-based pipeline outperforms two widely used syntactic parsers and produces a new VFF database with broader verb coverage and finer-grained distinctions.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables rapid, scalable VFF estimation, is customizable, and serves as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, with released code and data for future research.

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

### [4] [The role of media memorability in facilitating startups' access to venture capital funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22201)
*L. Toschi,S. Torrisi,A. Fronzetti Colladon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how media memorability, not just exposure, influences venture capital investment, showing that distinctiveness and connectivity in news content matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused narrowly on general media exposure, limiting understanding of how nuanced media content affects funding decisions.

Method: Analyzed data from 197 UK startups in micro and nanotechnology (1995-2004), focusing on media memorability and its impact on investment.

Result: Media memorability significantly influences investment outcomes, with venture capitalists relying on cues like distinctiveness and semantic network connectivity.

Conclusion: Startups should aim for targeted, meaningful media coverage to enhance memorability and attract investment, beyond just frequent mentions.

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

### [5] [How Well Does First-Token Entropy Approximate Word Entropy as a Psycholinguistic Predictor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22209)
*Christian Clark,Byung-Doh Oh,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the underestimation and distortion of word entropy when using first-token approximations and proposes Monte Carlo estimates for more accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of first-token approximations in measuring contextual entropy, which may distort true word entropy.

Method: Generate Monte Carlo (MC) estimates of word entropy, allowing words to span multiple tokens, and compare with first-token approximations.

Result: Regression experiments on reading times reveal divergent results between first-token and MC word entropy, indicating the limitations of first-token approximations.

Conclusion: Caution is advised when using first-token approximations for contextual entropy, as MC estimates provide more accurate insights.

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

### [6] [RL from Teacher-Model Refinement: Gradual Imitation Learning for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22219)
*Dongyub Jude Lee,Zhenyi Ye,Pengcheng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLfR is a novel framework for machine translation that uses continuous feedback from GPT-4o to improve translation quality, outperforming traditional methods on key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference-learning methods for MT rely on static datasets and struggle with generalization. RLfR aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging dynamic feedback from a teacher model.

Method: RLfR involves iterative refinement: the actor generates translations, the teacher (GPT-4o) refines them, and the actor is rewarded based on alignment with the teacher's refinements, using negative edit distance and COMET score as signals.

Result: RLfR outperforms MT-SFT and preference-based baselines on the FLORES-200 benchmark, improving COMET (semantic adequacy) and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

Conclusion: RLfR demonstrates the effectiveness of continuous teacher-model feedback in enhancing machine translation, offering a scalable and generalizable alternative to static triplet-based methods.

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

### [7] [Meaning-infused grammar: Gradient Acceptability Shapes the Geometric Representations of Constructions in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22286)
*Supantho Rakshit,Adele Goldberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if Large Language Models (LLMs) like Pythia-1.4B reflect graded, meaning-infused representations of English dative constructions, finding that prototypical examples are more distinct in activation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs' internal representations align with the usage-based constructionist view of language as graded, probabilistic form-meaning pairings.

Method: Analyzed neural representations of English dative constructions in Pythia-1.4B using a dataset of 5000 sentence pairs varied by human-rated preference strength, employing geometric measures like Energy Distance and Jensen-Shannon Divergence.

Result: Prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in LLM activation space, with separability modulated by preference strength.

Conclusion: LLMs learn graded, meaning-infused representations of constructions, supporting geometric measures of constructionist principles in these models.

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

### [8] [Intent Recognition and Out-of-Scope Detection using LLMs in Multi-party Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22289)
*Galo Castillo-López,Gaël de Chalendar,Nasredine Semmar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining BERT and LLMs for intent recognition and OOS detection in TODS, improving performance in zero and few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TODS require large annotated datasets, which is inefficient. The goal is to leverage BERT and LLMs for better performance with minimal data.

Method: Combines BERT's computational efficiency with LLMs' generalization power in zero and few-shot settings, sharing BERT outputs with LLMs.

Result: Improved system performance on multi-party conversation corpora by leveraging shared information from BERT to LLMs.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively enhances intent recognition and OOS detection in TODS with limited annotated data.

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

### [9] [A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Negation for NLP and Neural Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22337)
*Roxana Petcu,Samarth Bhargav,Maarten de Rijke,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies negation in neural information retrieval and LLM-based models, introducing a taxonomy, benchmark datasets, and a logic-based classification mechanism to improve performance on negation queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural models underperform on queries with negation, prompting a need to understand and address this gap.

Method: The authors introduce a negation taxonomy, generate benchmark datasets, and propose a logic-based classification mechanism.

Result: The taxonomy improves training setup for faster convergence, and the classification schema reveals dataset coverage of negation types.

Conclusion: The work provides tools and insights to enhance neural models' handling of negation, improving generalization.

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

### [10] [Traits Run Deep: Enhancing Personality Assessment via Psychology-Guided LLM Representations and Multimodal Apparent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22367)
*Jia Li,Yichao He,Jiacheng Xu,Tianhao Luo,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Traits Run Deep," a novel framework for personality assessment using psychology-informed prompts and a Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network to align cross-modal signals, achieving a 45% MSE reduction and top performance in the AVI Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate personality assessment is crucial for fields like emotional intelligence and mental health, but traditional methods struggle with cross-modal understanding and semantic modeling.

Method: The framework uses psychology-informed prompts to extract personality-aware semantics from LLMs and a fusion network (Chunk-Wise Projector, Cross-Modal Connector, Text Feature Enhancer) to integrate asynchronous audio-visual signals.

Result: The method reduces MSE by ~45% on the AVI validation set and ranks first in the AVI Challenge 2025 Personality Assessment track.

Conclusion: "Traits Run Deep" effectively improves personality assessment by leveraging cross-modal fusion and LLM-guided semantics, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

### [11] [PATENTWRITER: A Benchmarking Study for Patent Drafting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22387)
*Homaira Huda Shomee,Suman Kalyan Maity,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PATENTWRITER, a benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation, showing their effectiveness in producing high-quality abstracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline the tedious patent-filing process by leveraging LLMs for patent abstract generation.

Method: Evaluates six LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA-3) using zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting to generate patent abstracts from claims.

Result: Modern LLMs generate high-fidelity, stylistically appropriate abstracts, often outperforming domain-specific baselines.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for patent abstract generation, and PATENTWRITER provides a robust framework for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

*Xiaocheng Yang,Sumuk Shashidhar,Dilek Hakkani-Tur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for generating diverse comprehension questions for K-2 English learners, evaluated using FairytaleQA, with potential for AI-driven instruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reading comprehension assessment by adapting questions to learner proficiencies and ensuring thorough material coverage.

Method: Proposes a framework for generating diverse question types at varying difficulty levels, tested with language models on the FairytaleQA dataset.

Result: Demonstrates the method's capability to cover material comprehensively and adapt to learner needs.

Conclusion: The approach holds promise for integration into autonomous AI-driven English instruction.

Abstract: Assessment of reading comprehension through content-based interactions plays
an important role in the reading acquisition process. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach for generating comprehension questions geared to K-2 English
learners. Our method ensures complete coverage of the underlying material and
adaptation to the learner's specific proficiencies, and can generate a large
diversity of question types at various difficulty levels to ensure a thorough
evaluation. We evaluate the performance of various language models in this
framework using the FairytaleQA dataset as the source material. Eventually, the
proposed approach has the potential to become an important part of autonomous
AI-driven English instructors.

### [13] [NeedleChain: Measuring Intact Long-Context Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22411)
*Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the NIAH benchmark for overestimating LLMs' long-context understanding and introduces NeedleChain, a new benchmark with fully query-relevant contexts. It also proposes ROPE Contraction to improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like NIAH may not accurately assess LLMs' true long-context understanding, as models struggle even with simpler, fully relevant contexts.

Method: The authors introduce NeedleChain, a benchmark with flexible context length and reasoning order, and propose ROPE Contraction for improving LLM performance.

Result: Experiments show a gap between LLMs' ability to process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them.

Conclusion: NeedleChain provides a more accurate evaluation of LLMs' long-context understanding, and ROPE Contraction offers a simple improvement strategy.

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hyeonseokk/NeedleChain

### [14] [AI-generated stories favour stability over change: homogeneity and cultural stereotyping in narratives generated by gpt-4o-mini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22445)
*Jill Walker Rettberg,Hermann Wigers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether an AI language model trained on Anglo-American texts can generate culturally relevant stories for other nationalities. It finds narrative homogenization, with stories conforming to a single plot structure, sanitizing conflicts, and lacking diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess cultural relevance and narrative diversity in AI-generated stories across 236 countries.

Method: Generated 11,800 stories (50 per country) using GPT-4o-mini with a standardized prompt.

Result: Stories showed surface-level cultural symbols but followed a uniform plot: small-town conflicts resolved through tradition and community, lacking real-world depth or romance.

Conclusion: AI-generated narratives exhibit structural bias (narrative standardization), highlighting a need for cultural alignment in generative AI.

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

TL;DR: Falcon-H1 introduces hybrid architecture LLMs combining Transformer and State Space Models for high performance and efficiency, outperforming larger models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge conventional practices by optimizing model design, data strategy, and training dynamics for diverse use cases.

Method: Adopts a parallel hybrid approach combining Transformer-based attention with State Space Models (SSMs).

Result: Falcon-H1 models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with the 34B variant matching or outperforming larger models like Qwen3-32B and Llama3.3-70B.

Conclusion: Falcon-H1 offers efficient, high-performing models for diverse applications, released under an open-source license to promote accessible AI research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

*Tian Yun,Chen Sun,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot settings but improve significantly with minor parameter tuning, though results don't generalize across datasets, prompting a reevaluation of what defines an 'abstract reasoner.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the claim that LLMs lack abstract reasoning by demonstrating their potential with minimal tuning, while acknowledging limitations in generalization.

Method: Revisiting experiments, testing LLMs in zero-shot and tuned settings, and evaluating performance across datasets.

Result: LLMs achieve near-perfect performance with minor tuning but fail to generalize across datasets.

Conclusion: The findings call for a nuanced discussion on the definition and significance of abstract reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces forward and backward constraints generation to enhance Code LLMs' adherence to detailed requirements in controlled code generation, alongside IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark for nuanced evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require stricter adherence to coding style, line count, and structural constraints beyond correctness, which current Code LLMs lack.

Method: The authors propose forward and backward constraints generation and introduce IFEvalCode, a benchmark with 1.6K multilingual test samples, evaluating correctness and instruction-following separately.

Result: Experiments on 40+ LLMs show closed-source models outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation, revealing a gap between correctness and precise instruction-following.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved instruction-following capabilities in Code LLMs and provides a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

*Lei Sheng,Shuai-Shuai Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs (0.5B-1.5B parameters) underperform in Text-to-SQL tasks due to limited reasoning but excel in speed and edge deployment. Post-training techniques (fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) on derived datasets improved performance, with models achieving 56.87%-67.08% execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the potential of SLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks despite their current underperformance, leveraging their advantages in speed and edge deployment.

Method: Used SynSQL-2.5M to create datasets for SQL generation and merge revision. Applied supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and corrective self-consistency inference.

Result: Average improvement of 31.4 points on BIRD set; 0.5B model reached 56.87% EX, 1.5B model achieved 67.08% EX.

Conclusion: Post-training techniques significantly enhance SLM performance in Text-to-SQL, making them viable for practical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CliCARE is a framework that grounds LLMs in clinical guidelines for decision support in oncology, addressing challenges like long EHRs, clinical hallucination, and unreliable metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical decision support and reduce physician burnout by leveraging LLMs for synthesizing complex cancer EHRs, while overcoming key implementation challenges.

Method: Transforms unstructured EHRs into Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) and aligns them with clinical guidelines for evidence-grounded decision support.

Result: Outperforms baselines in diverse datasets, with high clinical validity confirmed by expert oncologists.

Conclusion: CliCARE effectively integrates LLMs with clinical guidelines, enhancing decision support in oncology.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSConDa, a Vietnamese customer support QA dataset, and evaluates 11 lightweight ViLLMs to address the lack of domain-specific benchmarks for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of benchmark datasets for Vietnamese LLMs in customer support contexts hinders model selection and development.

Method: The authors curated CSConDa, a dataset of 9,000 QA pairs, and evaluated 11 ViLLMs using automatic metrics and syntactic analysis.

Result: The study provides insights into model performance, strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic patterns, aiding in informed model selection.

Conclusion: CSConDa and the evaluation framework support the development of next-gen ViLLMs and advance Vietnamese LLM research.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

*Sung-Min Lee,Siyoon Lee,Juyeon Kim,Kyungmin Roh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ControlMed is a medical LLM that allows users to control reasoning length, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning LLMs in medicine are inefficient due to lengthy reasoning processes, hindering real-world clinical use.

Method: ControlMed uses a three-stage pipeline: pre-training on synthetic medical data, supervised fine-tuning with length-control markers, and reinforcement learning for accuracy.

Result: ControlMed matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on medical benchmarks while offering flexible reasoning length control.

Conclusion: ControlMed is a practical, adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical analysis.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CognitiveAttack is a framework exploiting multi-bias interactions to bypass LLM safety, achieving higher success rates than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks exploiting cognitive biases, but prior work overlooks multi-bias interactions.

Method: Combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate prompts with optimized bias combinations.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods (60.1% vs. 31.6% success rate) and exposes vulnerabilities in 30 LLMs, especially open-source ones.

Conclusion: Multi-bias interactions are a critical attack vector, bridging cognitive science and AI safety for more robust systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

TL;DR: The study explores how amplifying language-specific neurons in LLMs affects multilingual behavior, finding benefits for low-resource languages but limited cross-lingual transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of language-specific neurons in amplification and their impact on multilingual tasks.

Method: Amplifying language-specific neurons across 18 languages, evaluating effectiveness with the Language Steering Shift (LSS) score, and testing on downstream tasks.

Result: Optimal amplification steers output to target languages but degrades cross-language performance.

Conclusion: Amplifying language-specific neurons benefits low-resource languages but offers limited cross-lingual advantages.

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

TL;DR: BALSAM is introduced as a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark to address gaps in Arabic LLM evaluation, featuring 78 NLP tasks and a transparent platform for blind testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic LLMs lag behind due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity, and poor benchmark quality, hindering progress and accurate evaluation.

Method: BALSAM includes 78 NLP tasks across 14 categories, with 52K examples (37K test, 15K dev), and a centralized platform for blind evaluation.

Result: BALSAM provides a standardized, transparent framework to measure and advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: BALSAM aims to unify and elevate Arabic LLM research by setting benchmarks and fostering collaboration.

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates language-specific neurons in LLMs, identifies their clustering in deeper layers, and demonstrates how manipulating these neurons can control language behavior in multilingual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing in LLMs and explore how manipulating these neurons can enhance multilingual performance.

Method: Analyzed language-specific neurons in models like Llama-3.1-8B using the LAPE method and language arithmetics (activation addition/multiplication) to steer language behavior.

Result: Found neurons cluster in deeper layers, with non-Latin scripts showing more specialization. Language arithmetics outperformed simpler methods in multilingual tasks.

Conclusion: Manipulating language-specific neurons effectively controls multilingual behavior, with high-resource languages and typological similarity improving success.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Language-Neurons-Manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper investigates political biases in large language models (LLMs), revealing a tendency toward libertarian-left positions, with variations across languages and models. It also demonstrates how these biases can be manipulated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in understanding political biases in LLMs, including generalizability across architectures, scales, languages, and the potential for active control of biases.

Method: Evaluated seven open-source instruction-tuned LLMs across 14 languages using the Political Compass Test with paraphrased statements. Tested bias manipulability using a center-of-mass activation technique.

Result: Larger models consistently lean libertarian-left, with notable variations by language and model family. The intervention technique successfully steers model responses toward alternative ideologies.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit measurable and manipulable political biases, highlighting the need for broader evaluation and control mechanisms in their deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

TL;DR: A novel framework for holistic interview performance assessment integrates video, audio, and text data, using multimodal fusion and ensemble learning to achieve unbiased evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fair and comprehensive interview assessments by capturing explicit and implicit cues from candidates.

Method: Uses modality-specific feature extractors, a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron for fusion, and a two-level ensemble learning strategy for robust predictions.

Result: Achieved a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824 and won first place in the AVI Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The framework effectively advances automated, multimodal interview performance assessment with high accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

TL;DR: TIRESRAG-R1 improves RAG methods by addressing intermediate reasoning flaws with a multi-dimensional reward system and think-retrieve-reflect process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods focus only on final-answer rewards, neglecting intermediate reasoning quality, leading to failures like insufficient retrieval, faulty reasoning, and inconsistency.

Method: Proposes TIRESRAG-R1 with a think-retrieve-reflect process, multi-dimensional rewards (sufficiency, reasoning quality, reflection), and difficulty-aware reweighting.

Result: Outperforms prior RAG methods on multi-hop QA datasets and generalizes to single-hop tasks.

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1 enhances reasoning and stability in RAG methods, addressing key failure patterns.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination in LLMs across Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin, finding fewer hallucinations in Mandarin compared to Hindi and Farsi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucination in LLMs, especially in non-English languages, to improve reliability.

Method: Analysis of conversational data in Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin using models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen-3.

Result: LLMs produce fewer hallucinations in Mandarin but more in Hindi and Farsi.

Conclusion: Hallucination rates vary by language, highlighting the need for language-specific improvements in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

TL;DR: The paper explores adaptation strategies for pre-trained LLMs to improve text embeddings for non-generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MTEB's clustering track.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in text generation but lose crucial information when pooling token embeddings for non-generative tasks like clustering or retrieval. The study aims to enhance sentence- or document-level embeddings.

Method: Three strategies are tested: (i) token embedding aggregation, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) contrastive fine-tuning with synthetic data.

Result: Combining these methods yields top performance on MTEB's clustering track, with fine-tuning shifting attention to semantically relevant words.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively adapted for text embedding tasks through prompt engineering and contrastive fine-tuning, improving embedding quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

*Praveenkumar Katwe,Rakesh Chandra,Balabantaray Kali,Prasad Vittala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reward-driven fine-tuning framework is introduced to reduce entity hallucinations in abstractive summarization by optimizing for the Entity Hallucination Index (EHI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in abstractive summarization hinder real-world deployment of language models, necessitating a scalable solution without human annotations.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune a pre-trained LM, optimizing for EHI scores derived from automatic entity extraction and matching.

Result: Improves EHI scores across datasets, reducing entity hallucinations without compromising fluency or informativeness.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, annotation-free approach to hallucination reduction, with a released Colab pipeline for reproducibility.

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

*Jindřich Libovický,Jindřich Helcl,Andrei Manea,Gianluca Vico*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for open-ended regional QA with text and visual modalities is introduced, using LLMs as baselines. The dataset includes multilingual questions grounded in Wikipedia, revealing gaps in LLMs' regional knowledge and weak correlation between automated metrics and human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess regional knowledge in LLMs, study cross-lingual consistency, and improve evaluation metrics for open-ended QA.

Method: Manually curated multilingual questions (textual and visual) from Wikipedia, evaluated using LLMs and human judgments.

Result: Significant gaps in LLMs' regional knowledge and minimal correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a resource for evaluating LLMs' regional knowledge, cross-lingual consistency, and advancing QA evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit assessment is underexplored in LLM applications, relying on outdated rule-based methods. MASCA aims to modernize this with multi-agent collaboration.

Method: MASCA uses a layered architecture with specialized LLM agents and integrates contrastive learning for risk/reward optimization. It also applies signaling game theory for system insights.

Result: MASCA outperforms baseline methods, proving hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent systems effective for credit scoring.

Conclusion: MASCA demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly for fair and accurate credit assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and
agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling.
However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit
evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework
employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A zero-shot entity linker for DBLP's 2025 RDF-based Knowledge Graph is introduced, leveraging LLMs and a novel re-ranking method based on log-probabilities of the "yes" token.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve entity linking in DBLP's updated Knowledge Graph, which now includes publication venues as a new entity type (dblp:Stream).

Method: The method involves using LLMs to re-rank candidate entities based on the log-probabilities of the "yes" token at the penultimate layer, contrasting with previous KG-embeddings and re-rankers.

Result: The result is a zero-shot entity linker tailored for DBLP's 2025 Knowledge Graph, addressing the new entity type.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of the novel LLM-based approach for zero-shot entity linking in the updated DBLP Knowledge Graph.

Abstract: In this work we present an entity linker for DBLP's 2025 version of RDF-based
Knowledge Graph. Compared to the 2022 version, DBLP now considers publication
venues as a new entity type called dblp:Stream. In the earlier version of
DBLPLink, we trained KG-embeddings and re-rankers on a dataset to produce
entity linkings. In contrast, in this work, we develop a zero-shot entity
linker using LLMs using a novel method, where we re-rank candidate entities
based on the log-probabilities of the "yes" token output at the penultimate
layer of the LLM.

*Weijia Zhang,Songgaojun Deng,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TaSoF, a structured plan for query-focused table summarization, and SPaGe, a framework that improves reliability and scalability by formalizing reasoning into three phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language plans for table summarization are ambiguous and lack structure, limiting scalability and conversion to executable programs like SQL.

Method: Introduces TaSoF (structured plan) and SPaGe framework with three phases: Structured Planning, Graph-based Execution, and Summary Generation.

Result: SPaGe outperforms prior models on three benchmarks in single- and multi-table settings.

Conclusion: Structured representations enhance robustness and scalability in query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

### [37] [Where to show Demos in Your Prompt: A Positional Bias of In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887)
*Kwesi Cobbina,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a positional bias in in-context learning (ICL) called DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias, showing how demo placement affects LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of demo, system prompt, and user message positioning on ICL performance in LLMs.

Method: A systematic evaluation pipeline with two metrics (ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE) across multiple tasks and LLMs.

Result: Demo placement significantly affects accuracy and predictions, with the start of the prompt being most stable (+6 points gain).

Conclusion: Positional bias in ICL is a critical factor, especially for smaller models, though large models also show sensitivity in complex tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

*Shuqing Li,Qiang Chen,Xiaoxue Ren,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a large-scale study on physics failures in Physics Engines (PEs), addressing their manifestations, detection methods, and developer insights. It introduces a taxonomy, evaluates detection techniques, and provides actionable recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics Engines (PEs) are critical but prone to failures, impacting reliability and safety. Current testing methods are insufficient, focusing on crashes rather than complex physics deviations.

Method: The study investigates three research questions: manifestations of physics failures, detection techniques (deep learning, prompt-based, multimodal models), and developer perceptions.

Result: Key contributions include a taxonomy of physics failures, evaluation of detection methods, and insights from developers.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for improved detection approaches and releases resources (PhysiXFails) for future research.

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRIG-Bench introduces a dataset and metric (TRIGScore) to evaluate trade-offs in image generation across 10 dimensions, enabling comprehensive analysis of 14 models via Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack exploration of complex trade-offs in image generation due to limited datasets and single-metric evaluations.

Method: Developed TRIG-Bench (40,200 samples, 10 dimensions) and TRIGScore (VLM-as-judge metric), then evaluated 14 models using DTM for trade-off visualization.

Result: DTM provides a clear understanding of model trade-offs, and fine-tuning based on DTM mitigates dimension-specific weaknesses.

Conclusion: TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore offer a robust framework for analyzing and improving image generation models by addressing multi-dimensional trade-offs.

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage human color perception for meta-learning, addressing the neglect of color information in conventional methods.

Method: Proposes the ColorSense Learner and ColorSense Distiller, utilizing inter-channel feature extraction and knowledge distillation.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization, robustness, and transferability across eleven few-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in meta-learning by integrating color perception, improving few-shot classification.

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based segmentation for pediatric brain tumors shows robust performance for whole tumor and T2-hyperintensity, comparable to human variability, but struggles with enhancing tumor and cystic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric brain tumors (PBTs) are diverse and challenging to diagnose and treat. Deep learning (DL) offers potential for tumor delineation, but its performance across heterogeneous subtypes and MRI protocols is uncertain.

Method: A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on a retrospective cohort of 174 pediatric patients with various PBT subtypes, using T1, T1-C, T2, and FLAIR MRI sequences. Performance was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).

Result: The model performed well for whole tumor (WT) and T2-hyperintensity (T2H) (mean DSC: 0.85), similar to human variability (0.86). Enhancing tumor (ET) segmentation was moderate (0.75), and cystic component (CC) was poor. Performance varied by tumor type and MRI sequence.

Conclusion: DL is feasible for PBT segmentation, especially for WT and T2H, but requires refinement for ET and CC. Findings suggest potential for protocol simplification and workflow automation in pediatric neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frontier-Seg is a method for temporally consistent unsupervised terrain segmentation in mobile robot video streams, addressing the limitations of costly labeled data and frame-by-frame inconsistency in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised semantic segmentation methods require expensive labeled data and struggle in unrehearsed, unstructured environments. Zero-shot approaches lack temporal consistency, which is crucial for robust perception.

Method: Frontier-Seg clusters superpixel-level features from DINOv2 foundation models and enforces temporal consistency to identify persistent terrain boundaries without human supervision.

Result: Evaluated on RUGD and RELLIS-3D datasets, Frontier-Seg demonstrates effective unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg provides a scalable, unsupervised solution for terrain segmentation, addressing the challenges of labeled data dependency and temporal inconsistency.

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Yujia Zheng,Yu Yao,Zeyu Tang,Eric P. Xing,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses CLIP's limitations in handling misaligned and entangled image-text data by proposing a modular alignment framework (SmartCLIP) for flexible and disentangled cross-modal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with misaligned and entangled representations in image-text datasets, limiting its generalization for tasks involving short prompts.

Method: The paper introduces theoretical conditions for flexible alignment and proposes SmartCLIP, a modular approach to align relevant visual and textual representations.

Result: SmartCLIP demonstrates superior performance in handling misalignment and disentangling representations across various tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses CLIP's limitations, enabling better generalization and fine-grained concept learning.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HOG-CNN, a hybrid model combining HOG and CNN features for automated retinal disease diagnosis, achieving high performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of fundus images is time- and resource-intensive; automation is needed for early disease detection.

Method: Integrates HOG (local texture) and CNN (high-level semantic) features for retinal image analysis. Evaluated on APTOS 2019, ORIGA, and IC-AMD datasets.

Result: High accuracy and AUC scores: 98.5% accuracy for binary DR, 94.2 AUC for multiclass DR, 92.8% accuracy for AMD, and 83.9% accuracy for Glaucoma.

Conclusion: HOG-CNN is robust, scalable, and suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments.

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for

IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAMA, a learnable variational model for image reconstruction, and its neural network version, LAMA-Net. It provides a rigorous convergence proof for LAMA and demonstrates improved stability and robustness. An enhanced version, iLAMA-Net, is also proposed, showing superior performance in experiments on Sparse-View Computed Tomography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to develop a robust and interpretable method for image reconstruction by leveraging complementary information from image and measurement domains, while ensuring theoretical convergence guarantees.

Method: The paper introduces LAMA, a learned alternating minimization algorithm, and its neural network version, LAMA-Net. It also proposes iLAMA-Net, which integrates a network for generating suitable initializations.

Result: LAMA-Net and iLAMA-Net demonstrate outstanding stability, robustness, and improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The work successfully combines theoretical rigor with practical performance, providing a robust and interpretable solution for image reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

### [48] [Learning from Heterogeneous Structural MRI via Collaborative Domain Adaptation for Late-Life Depression Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22321)
*Yuzhen Gao,Qianqian Wang,Yongheng Sun,Cui Wang,Yongquan Liang,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework using Vision Transformer and CNN improves late-life depression detection from MRI by addressing domain heterogeneity and limited sample sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) is crucial, but existing methods struggle with small datasets and domain differences in MRI data.

Method: The CDA combines ViT for global context and CNN for local features, with three stages: supervised source training, self-supervised target adaptation, and collaborative training on unlabeled data.

Result: CDA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on multi-site MRI data.

Conclusion: The CDA framework effectively addresses domain heterogeneity and improves LLD detection, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

### [49] [UFV-Splatter: Pose-Free Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Adapted to Unfavorable Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22342)
*Yuki Fujimura,Takahiro Kushida,Kazuya Kitano,Takuya Funatomi,Yasuhiro Mukaigawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework is introduced to handle unfavorable input views by leveraging pretrained models and novel adaptation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward 3DGS models are limited to favorable views, restricting real-world applicability with unknown camera poses.

Method: The framework uses pretrained models with LoRA layers, a Gaussian adapter module for geometric consistency, and a Gaussian alignment method for accurate rendering. Training leverages off-the-shelf datasets of favorable images.

Result: Experiments on synthetic (Google Scanned Objects) and real (OmniObject3D) datasets confirm the method's effectiveness for unfavorable views.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully extends 3DGS to handle unfavorable views, enhancing real-world usability.

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSICA, a new paradigm combining change detection and visual question answering for interactive analysis of bi-temporal remote sensing images, supported by the DeltaVLM model and ChangeChat-105k dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack interactivity for query-driven analysis of land-cover changes in satellite imagery.

Method: Proposes DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture with a bi-temporal vision encoder, visual difference perception module, and instruction-guided Q-former, trained on the ChangeChat-105k dataset.

Result: DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis.

Conclusion: The RSICA paradigm and DeltaVLM model enable effective, interactive exploration of changes in remote sensing images.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Face Discovery (GFD), a task combining face identification and generalized category discovery (GCD), and proposes FaceGCD, a dynamic method using lightweight prefixes for improved open-world face recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for face recognition systems to handle both familiar and unfamiliar faces, advancing toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Method: FaceGCD dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using lightweight prefixes generated by a HyperNetwork, adapting to each input image.

Result: FaceGCD outperforms existing GCD methods and ArcFace, achieving state-of-the-art results on GFD.

Conclusion: FaceGCD advances open-world face recognition by effectively handling high cardinality and fine-grained face IDs.

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

Conclusion: GVD sets a new benchmark for video dataset distillation, offering high performance and scalability without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and
temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video
distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features,
ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEMS is a framework for predicting fine-grained individual to coarse-grained group and event-level emotions using a multimodal transformer and S3Attention architecture. It extends the VGAF dataset for holistic emotion analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding multi-person social situations requires analyzing emotions at individual, group, and event levels with contextual information.

Method: GEMS uses a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention architecture to process scenes, group members, and context for joint emotion predictions.

Result: GEMS outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models on the VGAF-GEMS benchmark, demonstrating effectiveness in holistic emotion prediction.

Conclusion: GEMS advances emotion analysis research by linking individual, group, and situational responses, with potential for further exploration.

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

*Jordan Vice,Naveed Akhtar,Yansong Gao,Richard Hartley,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are vulnerable to subtle frequency-domain perturbations, affecting tasks like DeepFake detection and image captioning. This fragility challenges their reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in VLMs when exposed to frequency-domain perturbations, undermining their use in critical tasks.

Method: Designed targeted frequency-domain image transformations to perturb VLMs and tested across five state-of-the-art models and ten datasets.

Result: VLMs are sensitive to frequency-based cues, and their outputs may not align with semantic content, revealing fragility in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the unreliability of VLMs under adversarial conditions, calling for more robust multimodal perception systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

TL;DR: MINR combines implicit neural representations with masked image modeling for robust, generalizable image reconstructions, outperforming MAE in in-domain and out-of-distribution settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods like MAE are sensitive to masking strategies and struggle with out-of-distribution data.

Method: Introduces MINR, a framework using implicit neural representations for continuous image representation, independent of masking strategies.

Result: MINR outperforms MAE in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, with reduced model complexity.

Conclusion: MINR is a versatile, robust, and efficient alternative to existing self-supervised learning frameworks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

TL;DR: MZNet, a U-shaped network, effectively removes moiré patterns using multi-scale and multi-shape components, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moiré patterns hinder applications like photography and defect inspection. Existing CNN-based methods struggle due to limited receptive fields and diverse pattern characteristics.

Method: MZNet integrates Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB), Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB), and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection to address moiré patterns.

Result: MZNet outperforms on high-resolution datasets and competes on lower-resolution ones while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: MZNet is an efficient, practical solution for moiré pattern removal in real-world applications.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

TL;DR: UAVScenes is a large-scale multi-modal UAV dataset with frame-wise annotations for images and LiDAR, enabling high-level scene understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV datasets are limited to localization or 3D reconstruction, lacking frame-wise annotations for comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: Enhances the MARS-LVIG dataset with manual semantic annotations for images and LiDAR, plus 6-DoF poses.

Result: Supports tasks like segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: UAVScenes fills a gap in UAV perception by providing a versatile benchmark for multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using conditional flow matching to quantify aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation, outperforming diffusion-based approaches in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation reflects natural variability among expert annotators, but current methods like diffusion-based approaches have limitations in modeling exact densities.

Method: The method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model, to learn exact densities and produce accurate segmentation samples.

Result: The approach achieves competitive segmentation accuracy and generates reliable uncertainty maps, reflecting inter-annotator differences.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures uncertainty in ambiguous regions, providing deeper insights into segmentation reliability, with code available for public use.

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing accuracy and speed in real-time video analysis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Method: Leverages parallel sequence modeling and introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism for adaptive focus on spatial-temporal features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 3.2% higher action recognition accuracy, 2.8% better tracking precision, and 40% faster inference.

Abstract: Real-time video analysis remains a challenging problem in computer vision,
requiring efficient processing of both spatial and temporal information while

*Zhixiang Wei,Guangting Wang,Xiaoxiao Ma,Ke Mei,Huaian Chen,Yi Jin,Fengyun Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline to enhance image-text pair data, creating a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous improvement. The refined dataset, VLM-150M, and the proposed training paradigm yield HQ-CLIP, which outperforms standard CLIP models in various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large vision-language models (LVLMs) can reciprocally improve the quality of image-text pair data, creating a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous enhancement.

Method: An LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline generates multi-grained textual annotations (long/short positive/negative descriptions). The refined dataset, VLM-150M, is used to train HQ-CLIP, extending contrastive learning with additional supervised signals.

Result: HQ-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding tasks, even surpassing CLIP models trained on 10x larger datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages LVLMs to refine data and improve model performance, demonstrating the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle in vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

*Youngho Kim,Hoonhee Cho,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel domain adaptation approach using event cameras and a student-teacher framework improves human pose estimation under motion blur without paired annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur in rapid motion or low-light conditions degrades pose estimation, and existing datasets lack blurred images, creating a domain gap.

Method: Leverages event cameras for motion-aware blurred image generation and a student-teacher framework with mutual uncertainty masking for pseudo-label refinement.

Result: Outperforms conventional methods, achieving robust pose estimation in blurred environments without target domain annotations.

Conclusion: Event cameras offer a scalable solution for domain adaptation in real-world motion blur scenarios.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

TL;DR: TopoLiDM integrates GNNs with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR scene generation, outperforming existing methods in realism and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigating LiDAR data collection costs and enhancing perception tasks in autonomous driving by addressing geometric realism and global topological consistency.

Method: Combines topological-preserving VAE with latent diffusion models, using 0-dimensional persistent homology constraints for real-world topological adherence.

Result: Achieves 22.6% lower FRID and 9.2% lower MMD on KITTI-360, with fast generation speed (1.68 samples/s).

Conclusion: TopoLiDM is scalable and superior for LiDAR scene generation, with code to be released.

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

### [65] [Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Task-driven Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22459)
*Jaeha Kim,Junghun Oh,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTR leverages diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details in degraded images, improving performance in high-level vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of restoring images degraded by multiple complex factors, which previous methods struggle with.

Method: Proposes EDTR, using pixel-error-based pre-restored images with mild noise and limited denoising steps to focus on task-relevant details.

Result: Significantly enhances task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with complex degradations.

Conclusion: EDTR effectively harnesses diffusion prior for task-driven image restoration, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

### [66] [Shallow Features Matter: Hierarchical Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22465)
*Zheng Xiangyu,He Songcheng,Li Wanyun,Li Xiaoqiang,Zhang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HMHI-Net, a hierarchical memory architecture for UVOS, addressing the over-reliance on high-level semantic features by incorporating both shallow- and high-level features, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UVOS methods rely too heavily on high-level semantic features, lacking fine-grained details due to no prior pixel-level annotations. This limits performance despite sophisticated memory designs.

Method: Proposes HMHI-Net with a hierarchical memory architecture and heterogeneous interaction mechanism (PLAM and SGIM) to integrate pixel and semantic features.

Result: HMHI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance across UVOS and video saliency benchmarks, demonstrating robustness across different backbones.

Conclusion: The hierarchical memory and heterogeneous interaction design effectively balances pixel and semantic features, resolving a fundamental flaw in UVOS methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

*Viacheslav Pirogov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a VLM-based zero-shot approach for deepfake detection, outperforming traditional methods on a high-quality dataset and the DFDC-P benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose a growing threat, but existing detection methods lack robustness by focusing solely on image classification without auxiliary tasks.

Method: Leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot deepfake detection, tested on a 60,000-image dataset and DFDC-P, comparing zero-shot and fine-tuned performance.

Result: VLMs, especially InstructBLIP, outperform traditional classifiers in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios.

Conclusion: VLMs offer a superior, robust alternative to traditional deepfake detection methods.

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

*Hui Liu,Chen Jia,Fan Shi,Xu Cheng,Mengfei Shi,Xia Xie,Shengyong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight network (LIDAR) is proposed for efficient crack segmentation using multimodal data, outperforming SOTA methods with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adaptively perceive and fuse cross-modal features for crack segmentation, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: LIDAR integrates a Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF), using mask-guided strategies and dynamic kernels.

Result: Achieves 0.8204 F1 and 0.8465 mIoU on a light-field depth dataset with only 5.35M parameters.

Conclusion: LIDAR effectively addresses the challenge of efficient multimodal crack segmentation with adaptive feature fusion and low computational overhead.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: CamFlow introduces a hybrid motion basis framework combining physical and stochastic bases for robust 2D camera motion estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 2D camera motion estimation are limited to planar scenes or struggle with complex non-linear transformations, prompting the need for a more versatile approach.

Method: CamFlow uses hybrid motion bases (physical and stochastic) and a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution for robust training.

Result: Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse scenarios, including zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: CamFlow provides a robust and generalizable solution for 2D camera motion estimation, validated by a new benchmark isolating pure camera motion.

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

*Yuhwan Jeong,Yunseo Yang,Youngjo Yoon,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSGformer uses spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration, outperforming existing methods by handling localized distortions effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather causes complex degradation patterns, but current All-in-One models struggle with diverse and localized distortions.

Method: SSGformer decomposes images into high/low-frequency features, uses multi-head linear attention, and introduces a grouping-mask with group-wise attention for restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments show SSGformer's superiority in handling varied adverse weather degradations.

Conclusion: SSGformer effectively addresses diverse weather distortions, ensuring consistent performance across conditions.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

TL;DR: A degradation-aware conditional diffusion model is proposed to enhance underwater images by predicting degradation levels and using adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from colour distortions and low visibility due to scattering and absorption, degrading visual quality and hindering downstream tasks. Existing methods lack adaptability and fail to leverage underwater-specific priors.

Method: A lightweight dual-stream network predicts degradation scores, guiding a conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone. It includes adaptive feature fusion and a hybrid loss function.

Result: The method restores underwater images with superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses underwater image degradation, achieving significant improvements in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed for N-HRI, such as varied distances, robot motion, and diverse environments. ACTIVE aims to fill this gap.

Method: ACTIVE includes 30 action categories, 80 participants, and 46,868 annotated videos (RGB and point cloud). ACTIVE-PC uses Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, and Elastic Ellipse Query for action perception.

Result: ACTIVE-PC effectively perceives human actions at long distances, as demonstrated by experimental results.

Conclusion: ACTIVE provides a comprehensive benchmark for N-HRI, and ACTIVE-PC advances action recognition in robotic perception.

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The segmentation of hepatic vasculature in surgical videos is clinically significant but lacks research due to dataset scarcity and task complexity.

Method: The authors propose HRVVS, embedding a pretrained VAR model into the encoder and using a dynamic memory decoder to preserve details between frames.

Result: HRVVS significantly outperforms existing methods on surgical video datasets.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust solution for hepatic vasculature segmentation, with the dataset and code made publicly available.

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates task-specific knowledge, outperforming existing approaches in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

### [76] [Subtyping Breast Lesions via Generative Augmentation based Long-tailed Recognition in Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22568)
*Shijing Chen,Xinrui Zhou,Yuhao Wang,Yuhao Huang,Ao Chang,Dong Ni,Ruobing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-phase framework for long-tailed breast lesion classification using generative augmentation and reinforcement learning to balance data distribution and maintain discriminative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes is crucial for personalized treatment, but skewed long-tailed data distribution in ultrasound imaging complicates automated recognition.

Method: Proposes a dual-phase framework with reinforcement learning-driven adaptive sampling and a class-controllable synthetic network integrating anatomical priors.

Result: Demonstrates promising performance on long-tailed and imbalanced breast ultrasound datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates distributional bias and enhances classification performance without compromising discriminative capability.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Galadrielle Humblot-Renaux,Gianni Franchi,Sergio Escalera,Thomas B. Moeslund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COOkeD introduces a heterogeneous ensemble method combining a closed-world classifier, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier for superior OOD detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection performance is constrained by single-classifier capabilities; COOkeD leverages diverse classifiers to overcome this limitation.

Method: COOkeD combines a closed-world classifier, zero-shot CLIP classifier, and linear probe classifier on CLIP features, creating a modular, post-hoc ensemble.

Result: COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance and robustness on benchmarks like CIFAR100 and ImageNet, even in challenging settings.

Conclusion: COOkeD demonstrates that a heterogeneous ensemble outperforms single-classifier approaches in OOD detection, offering modularity and robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

TL;DR: A deepfake detection algorithm for eKYC systems detects face swapping and reenactment by analyzing temporal inconsistencies and identity discrepancies, improving accuracy with a registered image and robust feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring eKYC system reliability against deepfake attacks by detecting face swapping and reenactment, while addressing image degradation.

Method: Uses temporal inconsistencies in identity vectors, registered image comparison, and a robust face feature extractor trained on a large dataset.

Result: Accurately detects deepfakes, robust against image degradation, and outperforms in comprehensive detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances eKYC security by reliably detecting deepfakes and handling image degradation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShortFT is a fine-tuning strategy for diffusion models that uses a shorter denoising chain to improve efficiency and alignment with reward functions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backpropagation-based approaches for aligning diffusion models with reward functions face computational costs and gradient explosion risks due to lengthy denoising chains, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: ShortFT leverages a trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model to create a shorter denoising chain, optimizing fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: The method significantly improves alignment performance with various reward functions and surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: ShortFT offers a more efficient and effective solution for fine-tuning diffusion models, addressing the limitations of traditional backpropagation-based approaches.

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

TL;DR: VL-Cogito, a multimodal reasoning model, uses Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) to improve performance across diverse tasks by dynamically adjusting training difficulty and reasoning path length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with unstable performance in complex and diverse multimodal tasks due to varying semantic content and problem formulations.

Method: PCuRL framework with two innovations: (1) online difficulty soft weighting and (2) dynamic length reward mechanism.

Result: VL-Cogito outperforms existing models in multimodal benchmarks (math, science, logic, general understanding).

Conclusion: PCuRL effectively enhances multimodal reasoning, balancing efficiency and correctness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GALTraj improves trajectory prediction by using generative active learning to augment rare tail samples without changing model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of rarely observed long-tail scenarios in trajectory prediction without modifying model structures.

Method: Introduces GALTraj, a generative active learning method that identifies rare tail samples and augments them with a controllable diffusion model during training.

Result: Significantly boosts performance on tail samples and enhances accuracy on head samples across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: GALTraj effectively improves trajectory prediction by focusing on rare scenarios through generative augmentation.

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurate brain tumor segmentation, especially with missing modalities, and unresolved issues like boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer.

Method: MST-KDNet employs Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge Distillation, Dual-Mode Logit Distillation, and a Global Style Matching Module.

Result: Outperforms leading methods on BraTS and FeTS 2024 datasets in Dice and HD95 scores, especially with modality loss.

Conclusion: MST-KDNet is robust, generalizes well, and is suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing
with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image
analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor
boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key
imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing
these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge
Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions,
Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global
Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial
learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024
datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both
Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality
loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential,
making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOTS introduces a method for generating fashion images using localized sketches and text, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion design combines visual and textual elements, but existing methods lack localized control. LOTS addresses this gap.

Method: LOTS uses a Modularized Pair-Centric representation and Diffusion Pair Guidance to integrate local and global conditioning in a diffusion model.

Result: LOTS outperforms existing methods in image generation, validated by quantitative metrics and human evaluation.

Conclusion: LOTS enables unprecedented customization in fashion design, demonstrated by its performance and the new Sketchy dataset.

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Motivation: Addressing security concerns from drone proliferation by developing a robust surveillance system for the 2025 VIP Cup challenge.

Method: Deploys independent YOLOv11n detectors on parallel infrared and visible streams, with customized preprocessing and training for each modality.

Result: Lightweight models achieve high accuracy in distinguishing drones from birds and classifying payloads, even in noisy, low-light, or blurry conditions.

Conclusion: The dual-modality design and specialized training enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR channels.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-guided data augmentation framework for 3D point cloud segmentation improves scene synthesis by enforcing local and global structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing augmentation methods lack global structural dependencies, limiting realistic scene synthesis.

Method: Proposes a framework with dual-level constraints (local geometric plausibility and global topological alignment) guided by learned object relationship graphs.

Result: Generates diverse, high-quality augmented scenes, improving segmentation performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances realism in scene synthesis and boosts segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety of vision systems in open-world environments by improving OOD detection using generative models as perceptual templates.

Method: Leverages DDMs' denoising trajectories and Stein score errors, amplified by SSIM, to detect anomalies without retraining on target datasets.

Result: Achieves near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, using CelebA as a base distribution.

Conclusion: Generative foundation models, like DDMs, show strong potential for anomaly detection, with room for further improvement.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SfT relies on point correspondences, failing under severe occlusions, while modern methods require large supervised datasets. This work aims to bridge the gap with an unsupervised approach.

Method: Uses image observations (color features, gradients, silhouettes) and a mesh inextensibility constraint for 3D reconstruction without correspondences or supervision.

Result: Achieves 400x faster reconstruction than best-performing unsupervised SfT and outperforms existing methods in handling occlusions and finer details.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised SfT method is efficient, robust to occlusions, and superior in detail reconstruction, offering a practical solution without the need for supervision.

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

TL;DR: A unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, applicable to various camera types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms like the 5-point or 8-point methods are limited to synchronized views, failing for asynchronous data from rolling shutter or event cameras.

Method: Formulates the problem using first-order dynamics and a constant velocity model, deriving a linear point incidence relation for efficient recovery of velocity and 3D points.

Result: Validated on simulated and real-world data, showing consistent improvement over recent methods across different sensing modalities.

Conclusion: The work enables efficient structure and motion estimation from asynchronous data, with potential for diverse applications.

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Motivation: Existing models for human trajectory prediction often overlook visual cues from body poses, which are crucial for accurate predictions in autonomous driving.

Method: The authors introduce 'Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that captures human poses and social interactions, compatible with various prediction architectures (LSTM, GAN, MLP, Transformer).

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets (Joint Track Auto, Human3.6M, etc.) show improvements over state-of-the-art models. The study also examines 2D vs. 3D poses and noise impact.

Conclusion: Using body poses enhances trajectory prediction, with 'Social-pose' proving effective across architectures and datasets, also applicable in robot navigation.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection
increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection
techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level
Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by
the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale
audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level
deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples,
thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features
an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual
interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under
the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware
cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised
singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive
experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation
studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and

the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of trained sonographers in low-income countries makes high-quality fetal ultrasound measurements challenging. Automated solutions are needed to improve prenatal care.

Method: FetalCLIP is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for image quality assessment (IQA) and evaluated against CNN and Transformer baselines. A segmentation model is also repurposed for classification.

Result: FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves an F1 score of 0.757, and the adapted segmentation model further improves performance to 0.771.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal ultrasound models enables task-specific adaptations, advancing prenatal care in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

TL;DR: MoCHA is a novel VLLM framework integrating multiple vision backbones and a dynamic MoECs module to address high costs and visual detail extraction challenges, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLLMs face high training/inference costs and difficulties in extracting visual details and bridging modalities.

Method: MoCHA integrates four vision backbones (CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2, ConvNeXt) and uses MoECs for dynamic expert selection, plus HGA for feature optimization.

Result: MoCHA outperforms open-weight models, improving hallucination mitigation by 3.25% in POPE and raising MME scores by 153 points.

Conclusion: MoCHA's MoECs and HGA modules are effective and robust, enhancing performance in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

TL;DR: Proposes DISTIL, a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion method for detecting Trojan attacks in deep neural networks, outperforming existing methods by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to Trojan attacks, necessitating reliable detection methods without strong assumptions or extensive data.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier to iteratively produce candidate triggers aligned with the model's malicious behavior.

Result: Achieves up to 7.1% higher accuracy on BackdoorBench and 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning.

Conclusion: DISTIL offers a promising, reliable backdoor defense without reliance on data or strong trigger assumptions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

*Patryk Rygiel,Julian Suk,Christoph Brune,Kak Khee Yeung,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometric deep learning model is proposed to estimate hemodynamic parameters in AAA patients, showing strong generalization across real-world variations like geometry changes and boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD simulations for AAA hemodynamics are computationally expensive, prompting the need for faster, accurate alternatives like geometric deep learning.

Method: An E(3)-equivariant deep learning model using robust geometrical descriptors and projective geometric algebra is trained on CT scans and CFD data from 100 AAA patients.

Result: The model generalizes well within and outside the training distribution, handles geometry remodelling, boundary condition changes, and varying mesh resolutions, and works with new artery tree topologies.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers accurate, fast hemodynamic estimation, demonstrating potential for clinical use in AAA patient assessment.

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

*Mian Zou,Nan Zhong,Baosheng Yu,Yibing Zhan,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised method using bi-level optimization improves AI-generated face detection by pretraining on photographic images and optimizing pretext tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of supervised learning for AI-generated face detection, which struggles with generalization to new generative techniques.

Method: Bi-level optimization: inner loop pretrains a vision encoder on photographic images with weighted pretext tasks (EXIF tag classification, ranking, and manipulation detection); outer loop optimizes task weights for manipulated face detection. Detection uses Gaussian mixture models or a lightweight classifier.

Result: Detectors outperform existing methods in one-class and binary classification, showing strong generalization to unseen generators.

Conclusion: The self-supervised approach aligns pretraining with detection goals, enhancing generalization and performance for AI-generated face detection.

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

*Qingcheng Zhao,Xiang Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Zeyuan Chen,Jianwen Xie,Yuan Gao,Zhuowen Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepR is a depth-guided framework for single-view scene reconstruction, using instance-level diffusion and depth throughout training and inference for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods underutilize depth information, limiting reconstruction quality. DepR aims to fully exploit depth for better scene reconstruction.

Method: DepR integrates depth-guided conditioning into diffusion models, using depth for DDIM sampling and layout optimization during inference.

Result: DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Depth-guided conditioning and integration throughout the pipeline significantly enhance single-view scene reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular multi-agent framework for UI-to-code generation improves robustness and interpretability by breaking the process into grounding, planning, and generation stages, outperforming black-box methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between visual UI designs and front-end code generation, leveraging multimodal inputs for better spatial and visual intent capture.

Method: A three-stage framework: grounding (detects UI components), planning (constructs hierarchical layout), and generation (produces HTML/CSS code). Extended into a scalable data engine for synthetic training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

Conclusion: The framework enhances UI-to-code generation, offering interpretability, scalability, and improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available

*Kedong Xiu,Saiqian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRecover is a framework to recover high-level semantic content (e.g., labels, captions) from intermediate features in split-DNN VLMs, addressing privacy risks without image reconstruction. It achieves high accuracy and introduces a noise-based protection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy risks from semantic information leakage in split-DNN VLMs, where existing methods produce blurry images, necessitate direct semantic recovery solutions.

Method: CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework, recovers semantics (labels, captions) from intermediate features. It also proposes adding and removing random noise to protect against leakage.

Result: CapRecover achieves 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and fluent captions on COCO2017 (ROUGE-L 0.52). Deeper layers encode more semantics. Noise-based protection is effective.

Conclusion: CapRecover effectively recovers semantics from features and mitigates leakage with noise, offering privacy protection without extra training costs.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

*Siqi Luo,Haoran Yang,Yi Xin,Mingyang Yi,Guangyang Wu,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TR-PTS is a task-driven framework for efficient fine-tuning of large models by selecting task-relevant parameters and tokens, improving both performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained models are costly to fine-tune, and existing PEFT methods lack task-specific adaptations, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal performance.

Method: TR-PTS uses Fisher Information Matrix for layer-wise parameter selection and dynamic token selection to merge redundant tokens, optimizing both parameters and tokens.

Result: TR-PTS outperforms full fine-tuning by 3.40% on FGVC and 10.35% on VTAB-1k, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TR-PTS effectively enhances fine-tuning efficiency and accuracy by focusing on task-discriminative information.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing GPU workload in modern games by leveraging AI for efficient upscaling.

Method: Train LCS on GameIR image pairs using adversarial training, reparameterization, and quantization. Compare with AMD EASF and FSR1.

Result: LCS outperforms AMD methods in perceptual quality, showing ESR models' potential for resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: LCS is a viable solution for efficient upscaling, reducing GPU workload while maintaining quality.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

*Kaining Ying,Henghui Ding,Guanquan Jie,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniAVS, a dataset with 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal expressions, and OISA, a model for multimodal reasoning and segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating multimodal information and understanding audiovisual content in Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (RAVS).

Method: Proposes OmniAVS dataset with 8 multimodal expression types and OISA model using MLLM for reasoning-based segmentation.

Result: OISA outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on related tasks.

Conclusion: OmniAVS and OISA advance RAVS by enabling deeper multimodal understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant
advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and
deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the
boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset
containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS
stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of
audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and
perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA
outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on
other related tasks.

*Penghan Zhu,Shurui Mei,Shushan Chen,Xiaobo Chu,Shanbo He,Ziyi Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using 3D U-Net for brain region segmentation and amyloid positivity classification from PET images alone, achieving high accuracy and potential for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on structural MRI or CT for brain region segmentation and amyloid classification, enabling scalable and reproducible analysis in PET-only settings.

Method: A 3D U-Net with four layers was trained on 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans (130/20/50 split). Segmentation used Dice scores; classification used ROC AUC.

Result: Segmentation Dice scores ranged 0.45-0.88; PET uptake error as low as 0.0011. Classification accuracy was 0.98, AUC 0.99.

Conclusion: The framework is promising for PET-only diagnostics, reducing manual work and coregistration needs. Future work includes clinical validation and extending to other PET tracers.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated
segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using
positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for
structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was
trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans,
with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with
scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy,
particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake
within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus,
and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square
error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a
classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake
quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results
highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic
pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available.
This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation,
enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research
applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to
diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

*Yueh-Po Peng,Vincent K. M. Cheung,Li Su*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model, improves fMRI task-evoked activity decoding using spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning, leveraging large-scale datasets for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding mental states from fMRI data is challenging due to high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise, and limited data. The paper aims to address this by leveraging large-scale datasets and transfer learning.

Method: Proposes STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model with spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning, pretrained on 995 HCP subjects' fMRI data.

Result: Substantially improves task-evoked activity decoding across sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal preprocessing. Shows benefits of larger receptive fields and functional relevance in pretraining.

Conclusion: Transfer learning with large-scale datasets is effective for overcoming fMRI decoding challenges, as demonstrated by STDA-SwiFT's performance gains.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain
activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial
precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity --
remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio,
and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer
vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns
transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via
spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning.
Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human
Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves
downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory
and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate
performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient
attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in
pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer
learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome
challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

### [109] [Towards Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via a Visual Foundation Model-driven Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22481)
*Tianyi Liu,Kejun Wu,Chen Cai,Yi Wang,Kim-Hui Yap,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework using visual foundation models and a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion module, eliminating the need for manual annotations and improving recovery quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for bitstream-corrupted video recovery require labor-intensive annotations and struggle with misleading residual information, prompting the need for a more efficient and effective solution.

Method: Integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, introducing the Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model and a Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC) module for adaptive residual processing.

Result: Achieves outstanding performance in recovery without manual masks, suppressing artifacts and enhancing residuals.

Conclusion: The framework improves user experience and reliability in multimedia systems, with potential for wider applications.

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,
as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain
degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,
bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and
understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and
labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,
resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery
remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames
may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,
we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that
integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to
different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the
framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich
priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and
corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.
Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)
module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level
corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and
high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our
method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in
bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask
sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user
experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia
communication and storage systems.

*Haoyu Wei,Xin Liu,Yuhui Liu,Qiang Fu,Wolfgang Heidrich,Edmund Y. Lam,Yifan Peng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an off-aperture DOE design to improve imaging fidelity in wide fields of view, outperforming traditional on-aperture systems by over 5 dB in PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing E2E imaging systems struggle with high computational complexity and off-axis aberrations, limiting image fidelity at wide fields of view.

Method: The work positions a DOE off-aperture for local wavefront control, using hybrid refractive-diffractive optics with differentiable ray and wave optics modeling.

Result: The off-aperture DOE improves imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at ~45° FoV and recovers color/depth at ~28° FoV.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and versatile, validated by physical prototypes.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs
with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks.
However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining
high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational
complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while
accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of
placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a
global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work
explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture,
enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local
control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages
hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and
wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and
demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the
off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of
approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming
traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and
depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE
configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications
validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

*MohammadAmin Alamalhoda,Arsalan Firoozi,Alessandro Venturino,Sandra Siegert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: trAIce3D is a deep-learning model for precise 3D segmentation of microglia, addressing challenges like noise and overlapping structures with a two-stage approach using vision transformers and cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation methods struggle with microglia due to noise, overlap, and lack of automation, limiting clinical insights for neurodegenerative diseases.

Method: A two-stage 3D U-Net with vision transformers: first detects somas, then refines branches using cross-attention and soma prompts. Training involves self-supervised soma segmentation followed by branch segmentation.

Result: trAIce3D improves accuracy and generalization on 41,230 microglial cells, enabling scalable analysis of complex morphologies.

Conclusion: The architecture, optimized for microglia, can extend to other cell types like neurons, enhancing neurobiological research.

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

*Yuxin Wei,Yue Zhang,Moxin Zhao,Chang Shi,Jason P. Y. Cheung,Teng Zhang,Nan Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel pipeline using depth and surface information for accurate spine morphology estimation in scoliosis, addressing limitations of X-rays and RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIS assessment tools like X-rays have radiation risks and accessibility issues, while RGB images are unstable due to environmental factors.

Method: Uses a Grid-Aware Multiscale Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net) with dual encoders and attention modules for depth estimation, integrating depth and surface data for spine analysis.

Result: Depth estimation achieves high accuracy (78.2%, 93.6%, 97.5%), and spine curve generation reaches 97% accuracy.

Conclusion: The integrated approach improves spine morphology estimation, offering a safer and more reliable alternative to X-rays and RGB methods.

Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and
appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common
form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant
limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and
remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB
images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible
to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model
stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel
pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,
compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine
morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the
subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an
adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale
Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both
patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based
Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)
module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our
depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different
evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,
respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we
integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.
This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,
achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

*Qiushi Sun,Jinyang Gong,Lei Li,Qipeng Guo,Fei Yuan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeEvo is a framework for synthesizing high-quality instruction-code pairs using two LLM agents (Coder and Reviewer) with hybrid feedback, outperforming baselines in code generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual curation of instruction-code pairs is costly and limited, necessitating scalable, validated synthetic data methods.

Method: CodeEvo employs iterative interactions between a Coder (generates code/test cases) and a Reviewer (provides instructions/feedback), with hybrid feedback for quality control.

Result: Models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data outperform baselines in code generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: CodeEvo offers an effective, scalable approach for code-centric data synthesis, validated by superior performance and in-depth analyses.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GeoOutageKG integrates nighttime light satellite images, high-resolution outage maps, and county-level reports to improve power outage detection and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outage data lacks spatial resolution, while satellite data lacks temporal granularity. Combining these can enhance outage assessment.

Method: Constructs GeoOutageKG by aligning diverse data sources (satellite images, outage maps, reports) with the GeoOutageOnto ontology.

Result: GeoOutageKG includes 10.6M outage records, 300K NTL images, and 15K outage maps, enabling robust multimodal analysis.

Conclusion: GeoOutageKG is a modular, reusable resource that improves geospatiotemporal outage analysis through multimodal data integration.

Abstract: Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk
assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year,
exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data
are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution
and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers
excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image
data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more
comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing
the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events.
However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating
spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge
representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and
predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal
knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light
satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and
county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for
constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology,
GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual
outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from
2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and
reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We
demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power
outages.

TL;DR: RecGPT is a next-gen recommender system framework that integrates LLMs to focus on user intent, improving diversity and satisfaction while benefiting all stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems overfit to historical data, reinforcing filter bubbles and harming user experience.

Method: RecGPT uses LLMs for user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, with multi-stage training and a Human-LLM judge system.

Result: Deployed on Taobao, RecGPT boosts content diversity, user satisfaction, and platform conversions.

Conclusion: LLM-driven, intent-centric design fosters a sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial
intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants,
and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant
on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,
optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.
This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical
preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a
result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately
harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole
recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of
recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places
user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large
language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,
and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into
an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the
above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a
multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced
pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative
judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.
Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance
gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and
satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.
These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that
LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually
beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

*Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper redefines systematicity in AI beyond explainability, distinguishing four senses of 'systematicity of thought' and reconciling it with connectionism. It argues for a dynamic, rationale-driven approach to systematization in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To broaden the understanding of systematicity in AI, moving beyond the narrow focus on explainability and addressing the perceived tension between systematicity and connectionism.

Method: Proposes a conceptual framework distinguishing four senses of 'systematicity of thought,' applies five rationales for systematization to AI, and evaluates their transferability.

Result: Reconciles systematicity with connectionism and introduces the 'hard systematicity challenge,' advocating for a dynamic, rationale-regulated approach to systematization in AI.

Conclusion: Systematicity in AI should be guided by rationales for systematization, determining how and when AI models need to be systematic.

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoEx introduces a hierarchical agent architecture to dynamically update the world model in LLM agents, improving planning accuracy by co-evolving plans with real-time observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents rely on static internal world models, leading to misalignment with the true state of the world and erroneous plans.

Method: CoEx uses hierarchical state abstraction, LLM reasoning for dynamic subgoal planning, and a neurosymbolic belief state for continuous learning.

Result: CoEx outperforms existing agent paradigms in planning and exploration across diverse scenarios like ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho.

Conclusion: CoEx's dynamic world model integration enhances LLM agent planning, addressing the limitations of static models.

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, LLM-Crowdsourced, is proposed to address challenges in evaluating large language models (LLMs) by leveraging LLMs to generate, answer, and evaluate questions dynamically, transparently, objectively, and professionally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs suffer from data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference, making it hard to assess true capabilities.

Method: The LLM-Crowdsourced method uses LLMs to generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually, incorporating dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional criteria.

Result: Experiments on eight LLMs in mathematics and programming show the method's effectiveness in distinguishing performance, revealing novel insights like Gemini's superior question-design and memorization-based answering in some models.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust, comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, uncovering findings traditional methods miss, and demonstrates high consistency in results.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [120] [Eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic near-eye displays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22420)
*Jie Zhou,Shuyang Xie,Yang Wu,Lei Jiang,Yimou Luo,Jun Wang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pupil-optimized holographic near-eye display (NED) that eliminates eyepieces and improves image quality by optimizing amplitude and phase distributions across multiple viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current holographic NEDs face challenges like image degradation and poor depth cues due to finite and dynamic pupil apertures, limiting practical applications in VR/AR.

Method: A customized spherical phase modulation strategy generates multiple viewpoints within the pupil, jointly optimizing amplitude and phase distributions to mitigate image degradation.

Result: The method significantly reduces image degradation and resolves depth cue issues, advancing compact and lightweight holographic NED systems.

Conclusion: This approach marks a major step toward practical, high-quality holographic NEDs for future VR/AR technologies.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization
approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR)
displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing
comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical
assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms
enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical
implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face
substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil
apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this
study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our
proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to
generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the
dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of
amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly
mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves
inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method
signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact,
lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent
requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

### [121] [Mesh based segmentation for automated margin line generation on incisors receiving crown treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22859)
*Ammar Alsheghri,Ying Zhang,Farnoosh Ghadiri,Julia Keren,Farida Cheriet,Francois Guibault*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A deep learning framework automates margin line detection in dental crown design, improving consistency and accuracy over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual margin line definition in dental crown design is inconsistent and non-repeatable, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: A modified mesh-based neural network segments teeth into regions to identify margin lines, enhanced by k-fold cross-validation, voting classifiers, and graph cut optimization.

Result: The ensemble model achieved 7 successful test cases out of 13, with better preparation quality reducing divergence from ground truth (Spearman's -0.683).

Conclusion: The proposed framework automates margin line detection effectively, with preparation quality influencing accuracy.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or
missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are
carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a
preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually
define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a
non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework
to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A
dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to
train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was
modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth
into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary
faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to
train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their
results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and
optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation
results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to
represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the
centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that
an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest
number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance
threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground
truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the
preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth
margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide
the train and test datasets for the community.

*Yangshu Yuan,Heng Chen,Xinyi Jiang,Christian Ng,Kexin Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIMR, a novel framework for multimodal reasoning, outperforms state-of-the-art models by integrating iterative self-correction and dynamic feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of LLMs and LVLMs in handling complex, multi-step multimodal tasks requiring logical reasoning and iterative correction.

Method: Proposes CIMR with two stages: initial reasoning/response generation and iterative refinement using multi-modal feedback. A dynamic fusion module integrates features at each step.

Result: Achieves 91.5% accuracy on the MAP dataset, surpassing models like GPT-4V (89.2%) and LLaVA-1.5 (78.5%).

Conclusion: CIMR's iterative reasoning and self-correction significantly improve performance in complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex

*Yanjin He,Qingkai Zeng,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using Zipf's law to determine optimal vocabulary size in tokenization, showing improved model performance when token distributions align with power-law behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting vocabulary size in tokenization rely on heuristics or dataset-specific choices, lacking a principled approach.

Method: Analyzes token frequency distributions using Zipf's law to determine vocabulary size, ensuring alignment with power-law behavior.

Result: Models achieve peak performance when token distributions closely follow Zipf's law, validated across NLP, genomics, and chemistry tasks.

Conclusion: Zipfian alignment is a robust and generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection, enhancing model efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

### [124] [Efficient Differentially Private Fine-Tuning of LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22565)
*Afshin Khadangi,Amir Sartipi,Igor Tchappi,Ramin Bahmani,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLDP introduces a reinforcement learning framework to optimize differential privacy in LLMs, improving utility and efficiency while maintaining privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between data privacy and model utility in LLMs, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, is a critical challenge. Existing DP-SGD methods are rigid and inefficient.

Method: RLDP uses deep reinforcement learning (SAC) to dynamically adjust per-parameter gradient-clipping thresholds and noise injection during training, optimizing privacy budget allocation.

Result: RLDP reduces perplexity by 1.3-30.5% and improves downstream utility by 5.6% on average, while speeding up training by 71% and maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: RLDP effectively balances privacy and utility in LLMs, outperforming traditional DP-SGD methods.

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

*Yunrui Yu,Hang Su,Cheng-zhong Xu,Zhizhong Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes floating-point arithmetic errors in gradient-based adversarial attacks using CE loss, identifies key contributors (underflow and rounding), and proposes the T-MIFPE loss function to mitigate these errors, improving attack accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overestimation issues in gradient-based adversarial attacks caused by floating-point arithmetic errors, which are not well-studied.

Method: Theoretical analysis of floating-point errors in four attack scenarios, leading to the development of the T-MIFPE loss function with an optimal scaling factor.

Result: T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss functions (CE, C&W, DLR, MIFPE) in attack potency and robustness evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Conclusion: The T-MIFPE loss function effectively mitigates floating-point errors, enhancing the accuracy of gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCR-AF, a novel activation function combining GELU and ReLU advantages to enhance neural network robustness and generalization, validated by theoretical and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in safety-critical applications, prompting exploration of activation functions for robustness.

Method: Proposes RCR-AF, blending GELU's smoothness and ReLU's monotonicity, with hyperparameters α and γ to control sparsity, capacity, and Rademacher complexity.

Result: RCR-AF outperforms ReLU, GELU, and Swish in clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, supported by theoretical Rademacher complexity analysis.

Conclusion: RCR-AF offers a principled, effective solution for improving neural network robustness through activation function design.

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

*Kuan-Ting Tu,Po-Hsien Yu,Yu-Syuan Tseng,Shao-Yi Chien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP) framework to compress DNNs for edge devices, combining fractional-order calculus and Gaussian functions. It achieves high compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy DNN loads on edge devices necessitate efficient compression techniques, but deployment remains challenging.

Method: Integrates fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs) using Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives and adaptive unstructured pruning (AUP) for compression.

Result: ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10: 85.2% size reduction with 1.52% accuracy drop; ResNet-50 on ImageNet: 69.1% size reduction with 1.63% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: FGFP effectively compresses DNNs for edge devices, outperforming recent methods in accuracy and compression.

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size
by 69.1%.

TL;DR: ReLU networks implicitly learn a linear model, and its decision boundary can be approximated and visualized using modified backward passes, revealing interpretable patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and interpret the implicit linear model learned by ReLU networks, demonstrating their reliance on interpretable patterns.

Method: Formally describe the implicit model and modify the backward pass to approximate its decision boundary, producing excitation pullbacks.

Result: Excitation pullbacks reveal high-resolution, perceptually aligned features in ImageNet-pretrained architectures.

Conclusion: Neural networks rely on interpretable patterns, enabling knowledge discovery and dependable AI development.

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

TL;DR: A method for optimizing attack generator prompts in LLM-based systems by measuring attack discoverability through repeated attacks and random seeding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the identification of vulnerabilities in LLM-based applications by refining attack generator prompts.

Method: Repeats attacks multiple times against randomly seeded targets to measure discoverability (expectation of individual attack success) and uses this to optimize prompts.

Result: Reveals exploitable patterns for prompt optimization, enhancing generator robustness.

Conclusion: The approach enables more robust evaluation and refinement of attack generators in automated red teaming.

Abstract: Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread,
making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important.
Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and
execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using
the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of
success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing
attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating
each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an
attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This
approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization,
ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SDeflection is a defense strategy for LLMs that neutralizes jailbreaking attacks by redirecting harmful intent instead of outright refusal, reducing attack success rates without compromising benign performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in critical areas necessitates robust defenses against advanced jailbreaking attacks, which bypass traditional refusal-based safeguards.

Method: SDeflection redefines LLM responses to logit-level attacks by producing semantically adjacent answers that strip harmful intent, neutralizing threats.

Result: Experiments show SDeflection significantly lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining performance on benign queries.

Conclusion: SDeflection shifts defensive strategies from refusal to strategic redirection, effectively countering advanced threats.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas,
ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While
traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent
logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by
directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We
introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the
LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model
produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet
strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful
intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers
Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign
queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving
from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced
threats.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the misuse of text-to-image diffusion models to create hateful optical illusions, evaluates their detection by moderation models, and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emerging risk of adversaries using AI-generated optical illusions to embed hate messages and bypass content moderation.

Method: Generated 1,860 optical illusions using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, evaluated six moderation classifiers and nine VLMs on the Hateful Illusion dataset.

Result: Existing models showed low detection accuracy (below 0.245 for classifiers, 0.102 for VLMs), highlighting vulnerabilities in vision encoders.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improved moderation tools and suggests preliminary mitigation strategies to counter hateful illusions.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the creation
of a new form of digital art: optical illusions--visual tricks that create
different perceptions of reality. However, adversaries may misuse such
techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages
into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work,
we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful
illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation
models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable
Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are
hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or
subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models
(VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal
significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection
accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs.
We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which
mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary
layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore
preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from
the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.

TL;DR: Dragon-FM unifies autoregressive and flow-matching models for efficient, high-quality text-to-speech generation, addressing limitations of AR and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models lack future context and are slow, while diffusion models struggle with KV caching. Dragon-FM aims to overcome these issues.

Method: Combines AR modeling across chunks for global coherence and parallel flow-matching within chunks for fast denoising, using 48 kHz audio codec tokens.

Result: Efficiently generates high-quality zero-shot podcasts, leveraging KV-cache and future context within chunks.

Conclusion: Dragon-FM bridges AR and flow-matching, enabling fast, coherent, and high-quality TTS generation.

Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced
generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which
rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow
generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)
caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel
text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model
processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per
second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global
coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast
iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache
across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it
bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous
AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers.
This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the
proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content.
Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its
capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

TL;DR: A low-cost radar-based method for human motion direction determination using feature augmentation and a hybrid Vision Transformer-CNN model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motion direction angle impacts micro-Doppler spectrum width, which is crucial for tasks like gait recognition. Current DTM-based methods lack simultaneous feature augmentation and motion determination.

Method: Generates radar-based gait DTMs, uses a feature linking model for augmentation, and implements HMDD with a lightweight Vision Transformer-CNN hybrid model.

Result: Verified effectiveness using an open-source dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method is low-cost, accurate, and improves motion direction determination for downstream tasks.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague.
The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus
determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information
for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map
(DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature
augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost
but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is
explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first
generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking
model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast
Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper addresses scanner bias in computational pathology (CPath) using deep learning (DL) and proposes ScanGen, a contrastive loss function, to mitigate this bias, improving model robustness across scanners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scanner bias in DL models for CPath hinders clinical trust and deployment. Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise better generalization but still suffer from scanner bias.

Method: Benchmark FMs on a multi-scanner dataset, identify scanner bias, and propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function for task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: ScanGen enhances generalization across scanners and maintains or improves performance in EGFR mutation prediction.

Conclusion: ScanGen effectively mitigates scanner bias, improving model robustness and clinical applicability in CPath.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining
actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been
at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,
it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those
introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This
may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired
by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in
CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent
pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a
multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.
Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function
applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby
enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied
to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe
that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while
retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.
