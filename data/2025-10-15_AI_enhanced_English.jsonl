Leveraging a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial\ntransformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:\nFirst, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the\ninput images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS\ntransformation.

This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model\nperformance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.\nUsing a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across\nfour partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and\ncompared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy\napproximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic\ncomplexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with\nprevious research, the results show that the models are able to generalize\nmorphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,\naccuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability\nthan with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In\nparticular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital\nrepresentation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than\nless-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that\nmodel behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather\nthan by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance\nthat resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs show human-like accuracy in morphological generalization tasks but performance is driven more by training data quantity than linguistic complexity, with better results for high-resource languages.", "motivation": "To investigate whether LLMs' linguistic abilities approximate human competence and whether performance is shaped by linguistic complexity or training data quantity.", "method": "Used multilingual Wug Test across four languages (Catalan, English, Greek, Spanish) to test morphological generalization with novel words, comparing six models with human speakers.", "result": "Models generalized morphological processes with human-like accuracy, but accuracy patterns aligned more with community size and data availability than structural complexity - better performance for high-resource languages like Spanish and English.", "conclusion": "Model behavior is primarily driven by linguistic resource richness rather than grammatical complexity sensitivity, resulting in only superficial resemblance to human linguistic competence."}}
