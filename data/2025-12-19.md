### [1] [TabReX : Tabular Referenceless eXplainable Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15907)
*Tejas Anvekar,Juhna Park,Aparna Garimella,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TabReX is a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating LLM-generated tables using graph-based reasoning and interpretable scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating LLM-generated tables either flatten tables into text (ignoring structure) or rely on fixed references that limit generalization, creating an open challenge for quality assessment.

Method: TabReX converts source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through LLM-guided matching, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity.

Result: TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis. The TabReX-Bench benchmark spans six domains and twelve perturbation types across three difficulty tiers.

Conclusion: TabReX establishes a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems with controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of tables generated by large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge: existing metrics either flatten tables into text, ignoring structure, or rely on fixed references that limit generalization. We present TabReX, a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating tabular generation via graph-based reasoning. TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through an LLM-guided matching process, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity. The resulting metric provides controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, yielding human-aligned judgments and cell-level error traces. To systematically asses metric robustness, we introduce TabReX-Bench, a large-scale benchmark spanning six domains and twelve planner-driven perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Empirical results show that TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems.

*Joel Mire,Maria Antoniak,Steven R. Wilson,Zexin Ma,Achyutarama R. Ganti,Andrew Piper,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocialStoryFrames is a computational formalism for modeling nuanced reader responses to stories, enabling large-scale analysis of storytelling practices across online communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models of reader response are limited and cannot capture rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses that readers have to stories, preventing nuanced analysis of storytelling at scale.

Method: Developed SocialStoryFrames formalism using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. Created two models: SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (382 participants) and expert annotations. Applied to SSF-Corpus of 6,140 social media stories.

Result: Models successfully characterize frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and compare narrative practices across diverse communities. The framework enables linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with generic taxonomy of reader responses.

Conclusion: SocialStoryFrames enables new research into storytelling in online communities by providing a computational approach to analyze nuanced reader responses at scale, bridging narrative theory with computational modeling.

Abstract: Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.

*Armağan Amcalar,Eyup Cinar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRAID introduces structured prompting using Mermaid-based instruction graphs to improve reasoning accuracy and cost efficiency in LLMs, evaluated across multiple GPT tiers on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show nonlinear relationships between performance, cost, and token usage, with current prompting methods often relying on unbounded natural-language token expansion that is inefficient for production agent systems.

Method: BRAID (Bounded Reasoning for Autonomous Inference and Decisions) uses a bounded reasoning framework with Mermaid-based instruction graphs that enable models to reason structurally rather than through unbounded token expansion.

### [4] [Examining the Utility of Self-disclosure Types for Modeling Annotators of Social Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16034)
*Kieran Henderson,Kian Omoomi,Vasudha Varadarajan,Allison Lahnala,Charles Welch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Personal information categories (demographics, attitudes, relationships, experiences) analyzed for predicting annotator labels on social norms; demographics most impactful, few related comments sufficient, diverse samples work best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work used personal information for modeling individual characteristics but limited exploration of what types of information are most informative for predicting annotator labels in subjective tasks.

Method: Categorize self-disclosure sentences, build annotator models for predicting social norm judgments, perform ablations and analyses to examine impact of information types on prediction accuracy.

Result: Demographics more impactful than attitudes, relationships, and experiences; theory-based approaches better than automatic clusters; only small number of related comments needed; diverse samples yield best performance.

Conclusion: Type of personal information matters for predicting annotator labels, with demographics being most informative, and diverse samples with targeted information selection improve model performance for subjective annotation tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of personal information in the form of persona sentences or self-disclosures to improve modeling of individual characteristics and prediction of annotator labels for subjective tasks. The volume of personal information has historically been restricted and thus little exploration has gone into understanding what kind of information is most informative for predicting annotator labels. In this work, we categorize self-disclosure sentences and use them to build annotator models for predicting judgments of social norms. We perform several ablations and analyses to examine the impact of the type of information on our ability to predict annotation patterns. We find that demographics are more impactful than attitudes, relationships, and experiences. Generally, theory-based approaches worked better than automatic clusters. Contrary to previous work, only a small number of related comments are needed. Lastly, having a more diverse sample of annotator self-disclosures leads to the best performance.

### [5] [Are We on the Right Way to Assessing LLM-as-a-Judge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16041)
*Yuanning Feng,Sinan Wang,Zhengxiang Cheng,Yao Wan,Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sage introduces a human-annotation-free evaluation suite for LLM-as-a-Judge using rational choice theory axioms to measure local self-consistency and global logical consistency, revealing significant reliability issues in current LLM judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks rely on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias and scalability constraints, undermining assessment reliability.

Method: Sage uses axioms from rational choice theory to measure LLM judges through local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity). It curates 650 questions combining structured benchmarks with real-world user queries.

Result: Sage metrics show stability and high correlation with supervised benchmarks. Current top LLMs (Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5) fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly 25% of difficult cases due to "situational preference." Finetuning, panel-based judging, and deep reasoning improve consistency. Human judgments also show substantial inconsistency.

Conclusion: Sage provides a reliable, human-annotation-free evaluation suite for LLM judges, revealing significant reliability issues in current models. Human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard, and explicit rubrics can help improve consistency.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted as an evaluation method and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.

### [6] [Convolutional Lie Operator for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16125)
*Daniela N. Rim,Heeyoul Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Integrating Lie Convolutions into CNN-based sentence classifiers improves accuracy by capturing complex non-Euclidean symmetries in language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs capture local, position-invariant features in text but have limited capacity to model complex transformations within language. The authors aim to explore Lie group operations to capture complex, non-Euclidean symmetries that are not commonly associated with language modeling.

Method: The authors integrate Lie Convolutions into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, proposing two models: SCLie and DPCLie. This approach leverages Lie group operations to capture complex transformations and non-Euclidean symmetries in language.

Result: The proposed models SCLie and DPCLie empirically outperform traditional Convolutional-based sentence classifiers. The results suggest that Lie-based models relatively improve accuracy by capturing transformations not commonly associated with language.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the value of integrating Lie Convolutions into language models and motivate further exploration of new paradigms in language modeling that can capture complex, non-Euclidean symmetries in text.

Abstract: Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks have been successful in capturing local, position-invariant features in text, but their capacity to model complex transformation within language can be further explored. In this work, we explore a novel approach by integrating Lie Convolutions into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, inspired by the ability of Lie group operations to capture complex, non-Euclidean symmetries. Our proposed models SCLie and DPCLie empirically outperform traditional Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, suggesting that Lie-based models relatively improve the accuracy by capturing transformations not commonly associated with language. Our findings motivate more exploration of new paradigms in language modeling.

### [7] [MRG-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Clinically Aligned Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16145)
*Pengyu Wang,Shuchang Ye,Usman Naseem,Jinman Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Medical report generation using semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) with report-level clinical correctness rewards instead of token-level objectives, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical report generation methods focus on mimicking radiologists' linguistic style rather than ensuring clinical correctness, as they use token-level objectives that prioritize word choice and sentence structure over medical accuracy.

Method: Proposes semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a large vision-language model. Uses margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) between key radiological findings from generated and reference reports as report-level reward, plus lightweight reasoning format constraint for structured "thinking report" outputs.

Result: MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 scores of 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR datasets, demonstrating that label-semantic reinforcement outperforms conventional token-level supervision.

Conclusion: Optimizing clinically grounded, report-level rewards rather than token overlap meaningfully improves clinical correctness in medical report generation, establishing semantic reinforcement as a promising approach for supervising medical accuracy in large vision-language models.

Abstract: Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a system for detecting hate speech driven by fake narratives (Faux-Hate) in Hindi-English code-mixed social media text, achieving competitive results in a shared task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms enable rapid spread of harmful content like hate speech and fake narratives, creating a need for automated detection systems to address this specific phenomenon called Faux-Hate.

Method: Combines advanced NLP techniques with domain-specific pretraining, using multi-task learning to handle both binary Faux-Hate detection and target/severity prediction tasks.

Result: The system achieved competitive results in the shared task, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting hate speech driven by fake narratives in code-mixed Hindi-English text.

Conclusion: Multi-task learning combined with domain-specific pretraining is effective for complex hate speech detection problems involving fake narratives in multilingual social media contexts.

Abstract: Social media platforms, while enabling global connectivity, have become hubs for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech and fake narratives \cite{davidson2017automated, shu2017fake}. The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain-adapted extraction pipeline using Qwen2.5-7B with LoRA fine-tuning achieves high accuracy (>98%) for extracting 15 key fields from noisy police incident announcements on Chinese social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured information extraction from police incident announcements is crucial but challenging due to variability and informality of social media text sources like Weibo posts.

Method: Developed domain-adapted extraction pipeline combining targeted prompt engineering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-7B model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Trained on manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020).

Result: LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly outperformed base and instruction-tuned models, achieving >98.36% accuracy for mortality detection, 95.31% Exact Match Rate for fatality counts, and 95.54% for province-level location extraction across 15 key fields.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides validated, efficient solution for multi-task structured information extraction in specialized domains, offering practical framework for transforming unstructured social media text into reliable structured data for social science research.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from police incident announcements is crucial for timely and accurate data processing, yet presents considerable challenges due to the variability and informal nature of textual sources such as social media posts. To address these challenges, we developed a domain-adapted extraction pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This approach enables the model to handle noisy, heterogeneous text while reliably extracting 15 key fields, including location, event characteristics, and impact assessment, from a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances derived from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020). Experimental results demonstrated that LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly improved performance over both the base and instruction-tuned models, achieving an accuracy exceeding 98.36% for mortality detection and Exact Match Rates of 95.31% for fatality counts and 95.54% for province-level location extraction. The proposed pipeline thus provides a validated and efficient solution for multi-task structured information extraction in specialized domains, offering a practical framework for transforming unstructured text into reliable structured data in social science research.

### [10] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Healthcare LLMs with Granular Fact-Checking and Domain-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16189)
*Musarrat Zeba,Abdullah Al Mamun,Kishoar Jahan Tithee,Debopom Sutradhar,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Saddam Mukta,Reem E. Mohamed,Md Rafiqul Islam,Yakub Sebastian,Mukhtar Hussain,Sami Azam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fact-checking module and domain-specific summarization model to reduce hallucinations in LLM-generated healthcare outputs, achieving high precision/recall for fact-checking and good summary quality scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated outputs in healthcare are often unreliable due to hallucinations, which poses risks for decision-making and patient safety. There's a need for reliable, accurate outputs in critical healthcare applications.

Method: Proposes a fact-checking module independent of LLMs that uses numerical tests and logical checks via discrete logic in NLP to validate facts against EHRs. Also develops a domain-specific summarization model fine-tuned using LoRa on MIMIC-III dataset.

Result: Fact-checking module achieves precision: 0.8904, recall: 0.8234, F1-score: 0.8556. LLM summary model achieves ROUGE-1: 0.5797 and BERTScore: 0.9120 for summary quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses hallucination issues in healthcare LLM outputs through independent fact-checking and domain-specific fine-tuning, providing reliable and accurate results for critical healthcare applications.

Abstract: In healthcare, it is essential for any LLM-generated output to be reliable and accurate, particularly in cases involving decision-making and patient safety. However, the outputs are often unreliable in such critical areas due to the risk of hallucinated outputs from the LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a fact-checking module that operates independently of any LLM, along with a domain-specific summarization model designed to minimize hallucination rates. Our model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset and is paired with the fact-checking module, which uses numerical tests for correctness and logical checks at a granular level through discrete logic in natural language processing (NLP) to validate facts against electronic health records (EHRs). We trained the LLM model on the full MIMIC-III dataset. For evaluation of the fact-checking module, we sampled 104 summaries, extracted them into 3,786 propositions, and used these as facts. The fact-checking module achieves a precision of 0.8904, a recall of 0.8234, and an F1-score of 0.8556. Additionally, the LLM summary model achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 0.5797 and a BERTScore of 0.9120 for summary quality.

### [11] [An Information-Theoretic Framework for Robust Large Language Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16227)
*Qizhou Chen,Chengyu Wang,Taolin Zhang,Xiaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IBKE is a novel LLM editing framework based on information bottleneck theory that enables precise knowledge updates with minimal disruption, achieving state-of-the-art performance in open-domain editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often contain errors or outdated information, but full retraining is expensive and disruptive. Current editing techniques struggle with generalization and cause unintended consequences, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE) uses information bottleneck theory to compress and isolate essential information for knowledge correction. It leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates for robust editing.

Result: IBKE demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple LLM architectures and benchmark tasks, showing improved generality and specificity of edits compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing LLM utility and trustworthiness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools in science, technology, and society, enabling transformative advances across diverse fields. However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.

### [12] [LoPA: Scaling dLLM Inference via Lookahead Parallel Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16229)
*Chenkai Xu,Yijie Jin,Jiajun Li,Yi Tu,Guoping Long,Dandan Tu,Tianqi Hou,Junchi Yan,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoPA is a training-free algorithm that improves parallelism in diffusion LLMs by optimizing token filling order, achieving up to 10.1 tokens per forward pass while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current confidence-driven decoding for diffusion LLMs has limited parallelism (1-3 tokens per forward pass), restricting inference speed despite their potential for high-speed generation.

Method: LoPA explores multiple candidate token filling orders in parallel branches, selects the one with highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence, and uses a specialized multi-device inference system with Branch Parallelism.

Result: Applied to D2F model, LoPA increases tokens per forward pass to 10.1 on GSM8K while maintaining superior performance to baseline. Achieves 1073.9 tokens per second throughput with multi-GPU deployment.

Conclusion: LoPA significantly accelerates diffusion LLM inference through token filling order optimization and specialized parallelization, enabling unprecedented parallelism without training.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for high-speed inference. However, current confidence-driven decoding strategies are constrained by limited parallelism, typically achieving only 1--3 tokens per forward pass (TPF). In this work, we identify that the degree of parallelism during dLLM inference is highly sensitive to the Token Filling Order (TFO). Then, we introduce Lookahead PArallel Decoding LoPA, a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm, to identify a superior TFO and hence accelerate inference. LoPA concurrently explores distinct candidate TFOs via parallel branches, and selects the one with the highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence. We apply LoPA to the state-of-the-art D2F model and observe a substantial enhancement in decoding efficiency. Notably, LoPA increases the TPF of D2F-Dream to 10.1 on the GSM8K while maintaining performance superior to the Dream baseline. Furthermore, to facilitate this unprecedented degree of parallelism, we develop a specialized multi-device inference system featuring Branch Parallelism (BP), which achieves a single-sample throughput of 1073.9 tokens per second under multi-GPU deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/zhijie-group/LoPA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves extreme sparsity (20B total params, 0.5B activated) with fine-grained expert segmentation and progressive sparsification for load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push the boundaries of sparsity in Mixture-of-Experts models, addressing the challenge of expert load balancing in highly sparse settings where traditional methods fail.

Method: Fine-grained expert segmentation (up to 96 experts per layer, activating only one expert per token), progressive sparsification schedule for load balancing, pre-training on diverse corpus, and post-training.

Result: Stable training without irrecoverable loss spikes, top-tier performance among comparable models despite activating only 0.5B parameters, and insights into load balancing for highly sparse MoE.

Conclusion: Sigma-MoE-Tiny demonstrates that extreme sparsity (2.5% activation) is achievable with proper load balancing techniques, offering a promising direction for efficient foundation model scaling.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for foundation models due to its efficient and powerful scalability. In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT reasoning models show 16% lower refusal rates than non-reasoning models when translating between Finnish and four low-resource Uralic languages, demonstrating better performance for endangered language translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation for translation focuses mainly on high-resource languages, creating a gap in understanding performance on low-resource and endangered languages, particularly Uralic languages which need preservation efforts.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of OpenAI's GPT models using parallel corpus of literary texts, analyzing differences between reasoning and non-reasoning architectures for Finnish to four Uralic languages (Komi-Zyrian, Moksha, Erzya, Udmurt) translation, with refusal rate analysis.

Result: Significant performance variations between reasoning and non-reasoning models, with reasoning models showing 16 percentage points lower refusal rates when attempting translations of low-resource Uralic languages.

Conclusion: Reasoning models demonstrate superior capability for endangered language translation tasks, providing valuable insights for Uralic language researchers and contributing to broader understanding of reasoning models for language preservation.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translation tasks has primarily focused on high-resource languages, leaving a significant gap in understanding their performance on low-resource and endangered languages. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of OpenAI's GPT models, specifically examining the differences between reasoning and non-reasoning architectures for translating between Finnish and four low-resource Uralic languages: Komi-Zyrian, Moksha, Erzya, and Udmurt. Using a parallel corpus of literary texts, we evaluate model willingness to attempt translation through refusal rate analysis across different model architectures. Our findings reveal significant performance variations between reasoning and non-reasoning models, with reasoning models showing 16 percentage points lower refusal rates. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working with Uralic languages and contribute to the broader understanding of reasoning model capabilities for endangered language preservation.

### [15] [Hacking Neural Evaluation Metrics with Single Hub Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16323)
*Hiroyuki Deguchi,Katsuki Chousa,Yusuke Sakai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers propose a method to find single adversarial texts ("hub texts") that consistently score high on neural evaluation metrics regardless of test cases, revealing vulnerabilities in widely-used metrics like COMET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural text evaluation metrics like COMET are widely used but black-box in nature, raising concerns about their reliability and safety. There's no guarantee they yield reliable evaluation results, so researchers want to identify vulnerabilities in these metrics.

Method: Propose a method for finding a single adversarial text in discrete space that is consistently evaluated as high-quality regardless of test cases. This "hub text" exploits vulnerabilities in evaluation metrics by achieving high scores across different source sentences.

Result: The hub text achieved 79.1 COMET% for English-to-Japanese and 67.8 COMET% for English-to-German translation tasks, outperforming translations generated individually for each source sentence by M2M100. The method also generalizes across multiple language pairs (Ja--En and De--En).

Conclusion: The findings raise serious concerns about the reliability and safety of neural evaluation metrics, showing they can be easily fooled by adversarial texts. This highlights the need for more robust and reliable evaluation methods in generation model development.

Abstract: Strongly human-correlated evaluation metrics serve as an essential compass for the development and improvement of generation models and must be highly reliable and robust. Recent embedding-based neural text evaluation metrics, such as COMET for translation tasks, are widely used in both research and development fields. However, there is no guarantee that they yield reliable evaluation results due to the black-box nature of neural networks. To raise concerns about the reliability and safety of such metrics, we propose a method for finding a single adversarial text in the discrete space that is consistently evaluated as high-quality, regardless of the test cases, to identify the vulnerabilities in evaluation metrics. The single hub text found with our method achieved 79.1 COMET% and 67.8 COMET% in the WMT'24 English-to-Japanese (En--Ja) and English-to-German (En--De) translation tasks, respectively, outperforming translations generated individually for each source sentence by using M2M100, a general translation model. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the hub text found with our method generalizes across multiple language pairs such as Ja--En and De--En.

TL;DR: SpeechLLMs (speech-integrated LLMs) don't yet outperform traditional cascade systems for speech-to-text translation, despite being designed to bypass transcription pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether integrating speech as a native modality in LLMs (creating SpeechLLMs) actually improves speech-to-text translation quality compared to established cascaded architectures that combine speech foundation models with multilingual LLMs.

Method: Created "Hearing to Translate" test suite that comprehensively benchmarks 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems. Evaluation spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech.

Result: Cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall. Current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings, and speech foundation models (SFMs) lag behind both. Integrating an LLM (either within the model or in a pipeline) is essential for high-quality speech translation.

Conclusion: Despite the theoretical advantage of bypassing transcription pipelines, current SpeechLLMs don't yet outperform traditional cascade approaches for speech-to-text translation, highlighting that LLM integration (in any form) is crucial for quality.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

TL;DR: Proposes privacy-preserving LoRA adaptation for clinical ASR to overcome domain shift and data constraints, achieving 17.1% WER improvement with 47% less forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical ASR could revolutionize healthcare documentation in resource-limited settings, but faces barriers: data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts that degrade existing models to 40.94% WER.

Method: Proposes efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for continual learning on edge devices, integrated with multi-domain experience replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Achieves 17.1% relative WER improvement on target clinical domain and reduces catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within real-world healthcare constraints while preserving patient data confidentiality.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) holds immense potential to streamline clinical documentation, such as digitizing handwritten prescriptions and reports, thereby increasing patient throughput and reducing costs in resource-constrained sectors like rural healthcare. However, realizing this utility is currently obstructed by significant technical barriers: strict data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts. We quantify this gap by showing that a robust multilingual model (IndicWav2Vec) degrades to a stark 40.94% Word Error Rate (WER) when deployed on real-world clinical audio (Gram Vaani), rendering it unusable for practical applications. To address these challenges and bring ASR closer to deployment, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable continual learning from incoming data streams directly on edge devices, ensuring patient data confidentiality. Our strategy yields a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on the target domain. Furthermore, by integrating multi-domain experience replay, we reduce catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation. These results demonstrate a viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within the constraints of high-impact real-world environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve health literacy by making complex biomedical information more accessible through text simplification using Large Language Models.

Method: Used public dataset of biomedical abstracts; tested three approaches: baseline prompt template, two AI agent approach, and fine-tuning; evaluated using OpenAI gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini models.

Result: gpt-4o-mini showed superior performance while fine-tuning approaches underperformed; G-Eval metric aligned well with qualitative human evaluations.

Conclusion: LLMs, particularly gpt-4o-mini, are effective for biomedical text simplification, and LLM-based evaluation metrics like G-Eval can reliably assess simplification quality.

Abstract: This study investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simplifying biomedical texts to enhance health literacy. Using a public dataset, which included plain language adaptations of biomedical abstracts, we developed and evaluated several approaches, specifically a baseline approach using a prompt template, a two AI agent approach, and a fine-tuning approach. We selected OpenAI gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini models as baselines for further research. We evaluated our approaches with quantitative metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid grade level, SMOG Index, SARI, and BERTScore, G-Eval, as well as with qualitative metric, more precisely 5-point Likert scales for simplicity, accuracy, completeness, brevity. Results showed a superior performance of gpt-4o-mini and an underperformance of FT approaches. G-Eval, a LLM based quantitative metric, showed promising results, ranking the approaches similarly as the qualitative metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simplifying scientific texts at both sentence and document levels for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText track competition, exploring different approaches to make complex scientific content more accessible.

Method: Used OpenAI's GPT-4.1 models (gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano) with two approaches: 1) no-context method relying on prompt engineering, and 2) fine-tuned models. Compared performance across models and approaches for both sentence-level and document-level simplification.

Result: GPT-4.1-mini with no-context approach showed robust performance at both sentence and document levels. Fine-tuned models had mixed results, with gpt-4.1-nano-ft performing well at document-level simplification in one specific case. Results highlight the complexity of text simplification at different granularities.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering with GPT-4.1-mini (no-context) provides effective scientific text simplification, while fine-tuning shows variable results depending on model size and simplification granularity, suggesting careful approach selection is needed for different simplification tasks.

Abstract: This work describes our submission to the CLEF 2025 SimpleText track Task 1, addressing both sentenceand document-level simplification of scientific texts. The methodology centered on using the gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1mini, and gpt-4.1-nano models from OpenAI. Two distinct approaches were compared: a no-context method relying on prompt engineering and a fine-tuned (FT) method across models. The gpt-4.1-mini model with no-context demonstrated robust performance at both levels of simplification, while the fine-tuned models showed mixed results, highlighting the complexities of simplifying text at different granularities, where gpt-4.1-nano-ft performance stands out at document-level simplification in one case.

*Iker García-Ferrero,David Montero,Roman Orus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Refusal Steering is an inference-time method that uses LLM-as-a-judge to assign refusal confidence scores and ridge-regularized steering vectors to control LLM refusal behavior on politically sensitive topics without retraining, removing political refusals while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have fragile pattern-based refusal detection for politically sensitive topics, and there's a need for fine-grained control over refusal behavior without retraining models. The paper aims to provide transparent, controllable moderation at inference time.

Method: Replace pattern-based refusal detection with LLM-as-a-judge to assign refusal confidence scores. Propose ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate refusal-compliance direction. Apply activation steering during inference to modify model behavior.

Result: On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, the method removes refusal behavior on politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. Approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired.

Conclusion: Activation steering can remove political refusal behavior while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time. Refusal signals concentrate in deeper transformer layers and are distributed across many dimensions.

Abstract: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

TL;DR: JustRL shows that simple single-stage RL training with fixed hyperparameters can outperform complex multi-stage approaches on reasoning tasks, using less compute and avoiding common training instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions whether the increasing complexity in RL for LLMs (multi-stage pipelines, dynamic hyperparameters, curriculum learning) is actually necessary, suggesting simpler approaches might work better.

Method: JustRL uses minimal single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters, applied to two 1.5B reasoning models, avoiding complex interventions like length penalties and robust verifiers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (54.9% and 64.3% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) with 2× less compute than sophisticated approaches, with smooth training and transferable hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Complexity in RL for LLMs may be solving problems that disappear with stable, scaled-up baselines; simpler approaches can be more effective and efficient.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.

TL;DR: GinSign framework improves NL-to-temporal logic translation by learning to ground NL spans to system signatures, achieving 95.5% logical-equivalence accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks either assume accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy, limiting their practical use for building trustworthy autonomous systems.

Method: Proposes GinSign framework with hierarchical grounding model: first predicts predicate labels, then selects appropriately typed constant arguments. Converts free-form generation into structured classification using smaller masked language models instead of expensive LLMs.

Result: Achieves 95.5% grounded logical-equivalence scores, 1.4× improvement over state-of-the-art. Frameworks without proper grounding produce syntactically correct but semantically nonequivalent LTL.

Conclusion: GinSign enables accurate grounding for NL-to-TL translation, supporting downstream model checking and improving practical applicability for autonomous systems specification.

Abstract: Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems fail when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated/subjective information, and prior work lacks unified reasoning supervision for these issues.

Method: Proposes reasoning-trace-augmented RAG with three reasoning stages: document-level adjudication, conflict analysis, and grounded synthesis. Introduces Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline using LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation.

Result: Substantial gains over baselines: Qwen SFT improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722. Created 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline.

Conclusion: The framework establishes foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems with structured reasoning and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

TL;DR: MM-RAG for biomedical QA: Converting figures/tables to text works better for mid-size models, while OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive with frontier models. ColFlor retriever offers efficiency parity with heavier options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off in MM-RAG between converting figures/tables to text vs. using OCR-free visual retrieval for visually dense biomedical domains like glycobiology, and to determine optimal pipeline choices based on model capacity.

Method: Built a benchmark of 120 MCQs from 25 glycobiology papers stratified by retrieval difficulty. Implemented four augmentations: None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali). Evaluated mid-size open-source (Gemma-3-27B-IT) and frontier proprietary models (GPT-4o/5 families) with multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Used Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing with 5 runs per configuration.

Result: With Gemma-3-27B-IT: Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o: Multi-modal achieved 0.808, Text 0.782, ColPali 0.745. With GPT-5 family: Best results with ColPali/ColFlor improved to 0.828. ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger variants by 8-10%.

Conclusion: Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, while OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive with frontier models. ColFlor offers parity with heavier retrievers at smaller footprint, making it an efficient default with strong generators.

Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) promises grounded biomedical QA, but it is unclear when to (i) convert figures/tables into text versus (ii) use optical character recognition (OCR)-free visual retrieval that returns page images and leaves interpretation to the generator. We study this trade-off in glycobiology, a visually dense domain. We built a benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty (easy text, medium figures/tables, hard cross-evidence). We implemented four augmentations-None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali)-using Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing. We evaluated mid-size open-source and frontier proprietary models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT, GPT-4o family). Additional testing used the GPT-5 family and multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed over 5 runs per configuration. With Gemma-3-27B-IT, Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o, Multi-modal achieved 0.808, with Text 0.782 and ColPali 0.745 close behind; within-model differences were small. In follow-on experiments with the GPT-5 family, the best results with ColPali and ColFlor improved by ~2% to 0.828 in both cases. In general, across the GPT-5 family, ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger GPT-5 variants by roughly 8-10%. Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, whereas OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models. Among retrievers, ColFlor offers parity with heavier options at a smaller footprint, making it an efficient default when strong generators are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NL-to-temporal logic translation methods struggle with accurate atomic proposition lifting, handling co-references, and learning from limited data due to unrestricted vocabulary prediction.

Method: GraFT reduces solution space complexity by restricting valid output tokens at each step using grammar constraints, exploiting unique properties of lifting and translation problems.

Result: GraFT improves end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average across CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks.

Conclusion: Grammar-constrained token restriction significantly improves NL-to-temporal logic translation efficiency and accuracy, with theoretical justification for better learning.

Abstract: Translating natural language (NL) into a formal language such as temporal logic (TL) is integral for human communication with robots and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.

*Aditya Yadavalli,Tiago Pimentel,Tamar I Regev,Ethan Wilcox,Alex Warstadt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers propose an information-theoretic method to quantify how much information prosody (speech melody) conveys beyond text, finding it provides 10x more information about sarcasm and emotion than text alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prosody conveys critical information not captured by text, but there's a need to quantify exactly how much information it provides and what that information is about. Current approaches don't systematically measure the specific information content of prosody separate from text.

Method: Use large speech and language models to estimate mutual information between utterance meaning dimensions (emotion, sarcasm, questionhood) and communication channels (audio vs text). Apply this approach to TV and podcast speech data.

Result: For sarcasm and emotion, audio/prosody transmits over 10x more information than text alone when long-term context is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic approach successfully quantifies prosodic information. Future work should apply this method to more meaning dimensions, communication channels, and languages.

Abstract: Prosody -- the melody of speech -- conveys critical information often not captured by the words or text of a message. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information. We conclude by outlining a program applying our approach to more dimensions of meaning, communication channels, and languages.

TL;DR: LLMCache is a layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity, achieving up to 3.1× speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have high inference latency that limits real-time and large-scale deployment. Existing caching mechanisms like token-level key-value caches are limited in scope and applicability.

Method: A model-agnostic layer-wise caching framework that reuses intermediate activations based on semantic similarity. Uses lightweight fingerprinting for input matching and adaptive eviction strategies for cache management.

Result: Achieves up to 3.1× speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMCache provides a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications, supporting both encoder and decoder architectures with arbitrary layer caching.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSearch: A two-stage RL framework for LLM search agents that explicitly separates problem solving from search invocation decisions, improving knowledge boundary awareness and reducing unnecessary searches while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM search agents either over-rely on search (costly, risky) or under-use it (hallucination risk). Existing RL approaches use crude search call penalties that require extensive reward engineering, have ambiguous credit assignment, and can be gamed. There's a need for agents that truly understand when to use parametric knowledge vs. search, especially for high-stakes domains requiring transparency.

Method: AdaSearch: A two-stage reinforcement learning framework that disentangles problem solving from search invocation decisions. First stage: agents learn to solve problems. Second stage: explicit decision-making about whether to invoke search, making the process transparent and interpretable. Uses outcome-driven RL rather than search call penalties.

Result: Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors compared to prior methods like Search-R1.

Conclusion: AdaSearch addresses key limitations of existing search agents by making search invocation decisions explicit and interpretable, enabling better adaptation between parametric knowledge and external search. This is particularly valuable for high-stakes domains like finance and medical QA where transparency is crucial.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors.

*Yushi Hu,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Melissa Hall,Emily Dinan,Luke Zettlemoyer,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMRB2 is the first comprehensive benchmark for multimodal reward models, covering 4 tasks with 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs, revealing current models achieve 59-80% accuracy vs >90% for humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models are crucial for training LLMs but remain underexplored for multimodal (image+text) models, creating a need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Created MMRB2 benchmark with: 1) practical challenging prompts, 2) responses from SOTA models/agents, 3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus via ensemble filtering. Evaluated existing judges including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and human-preference-trained models.

Result: Gemini 3 Pro: 75-80% accuracy; GPT-5 & Gemini 2.5 Pro: 66-75%; GPT-4o: 59%; Qwen3-VL-32B: similar to Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). Humans achieve >90% accuracy. MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success.

Conclusion: MMRB2 enables systematic evaluation of multimodal reward models, revealing significant performance gaps between current models and human-level judgment, and identifies key improvement areas for future development.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.

*Eric Todd,Jannik Brinkmann,Rohit Gandikota,David Bau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers trained on arithmetic with variable symbol meanings develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms rather than geometric embeddings, achieving near-perfect accuracy and generalization to unseen algebraic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work shows transformers develop geometric embeddings mirroring algebraic structure when tokens have fixed meanings, but this paper investigates what happens when symbol meanings vary across sequences, creating a more challenging reasoning task.

Method: Devised a new task where assignment of symbols to algebraic group elements varies per sequence, trained transformers on this task, and used targeted data distributions to create causal tests of hypothesized mechanisms.

Result: Transformers achieved near-perfect accuracy on the variable-symbol task and generalized to unseen algebraic groups. Three consistent mechanisms were identified: commutative copying (dedicated head copies answers), identity element recognition, and closure-based cancellation (tracks group membership).

Conclusion: Unlike fixed-symbol settings that produce geometric representations, models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed, showing transformers can learn abstract symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms that arise when transformers are trained to solve arithmetic on sequences where tokens are variables whose meaning is determined only through their interactions. While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed.

TL;DR: CCA method identifies and updates only sparse circuits responsible for specific tasks, improving math reasoning by +11.4% while modifying ≤1.59% of components with minimal impact on other abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research shows LLMs have sparse subnetworks (circuits) for specific tasks, and fine-tuning often strengthens existing circuits. This suggests possibility of direct circuit intervention for precise, task-targeted updates.

Method: Constructive Circuit Amplification (CCA) identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces and model components responsible for desired task, then updates only those specific components.

Result: Applied to mathematical reasoning: improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components. Minimal impact on other abilities (MMLU, TriviaQA, TruthfulQA).

Conclusion: Targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components, demonstrating precise circuit-level intervention is effective.

Abstract: Prior studies investigating the internal workings of LLMs have uncovered sparse subnetworks, often referred to as circuits, that are responsible for performing specific tasks. Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components.

Motivation: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition, creating a need for effective data augmentation methods to generate realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations.

Method: Two-step framework: 1) Rule-based mask warping, 2) Unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs. Introduces non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity.

TL;DR: JARVIS is a JEPA-inspired framework that enhances MLLMs' visual reasoning by integrating self-supervised visual learning through frozen vision foundation models, improving performance on vision-centric tasks without harming multimodal abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited visual reasoning capabilities because they learn visual understanding primarily from subjective/incomplete textual descriptions and overfit language priors due to modest multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training.

Method: Integrates I-JEPA learning paradigm into standard vision-language alignment pipeline. Uses frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor (implemented as early LLM layers) to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments show JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: JARVIS effectively addresses MLLMs' visual reasoning limitations by incorporating self-supervised visual learning, enhancing visual understanding while maintaining multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CityNav, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' sequential decision-making in real-world city navigation without environmental annotations, and proposes Verbalization of Path (VoP) to improve performance by grounding reasoning in explicit cognitive maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluation benchmarks are too language-centric or simulation-based, lacking assessment of nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning needed for practical real-world embodied tasks like city navigation.

Method: 1) Introduces Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation task; 2) Creates CityNav benchmark with 4 global cities, 50+ decision points; 3) Agents use only visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning; 4) Proposes Verbalization of Path (VoP) technique that probes explicit cognitive maps (landmarks, directions) from MLLMs to ground reasoning.

Result: Current SOTA MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform on CityNav. VoP substantially enhances navigation success by explicitly grounding agent reasoning.

Conclusion: CityNav reveals limitations of current MLLMs in knowledge-intensive real-world navigation. VoP demonstrates the importance of explicit cognitive mapping for improving embodied agent performance in challenging, sparsely grounded environments.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R4 is a training-free framework that equips vision-language models with structured 4D spatio-temporal memory for embodied reasoning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human ability to build persistent, structured internal representations of semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics for reasoning about surroundings in four dimensions.

Method: Continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations for VLM reasoning.

Result: R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks.

Conclusion: R4 advances a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments by enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training through direct 4D space retrieval.

Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Perceptual Observatory is a framework for evaluating multimodal LLMs' visual perceptual capabilities beyond just accuracy, testing robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluations focus on end-task accuracy but overlook robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under perturbations. There's concern that progress may reflect textual knowledge rather than genuine visual grounding, especially since many models reuse identical vision encoders while scaling language components.

Method: A framework with two main verticals: (1) simple vision tasks like face matching and text-in-vision comprehension, and (2) local-to-global understanding including image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization. Uses ground-truth datasets systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions.

Result: The framework provides insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, offering a principled foundation for analyzing model strengths and weaknesses beyond leaderboard accuracy.

Conclusion: The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond traditional accuracy-focused evaluation to systematically characterize MLLMs' perceptual capacities, addressing concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on textual knowledge.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

Motivation: Most prior research focuses on single-human behavior prediction from egocentric view, but many robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective, which lacks suitable datasets and methods.

Method: Uses Vision Language Model (VLM) framework incorporating contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs. Fine-tuned with synthetic human behavior data from photorealistic simulator using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: CAMP-VLM outperforms best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy. Evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses multi-human behavior prediction from third-person perspective using VLM with contextual and spatial features, demonstrating strong generalization from synthetic to real-world data.

Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated multispectral data restricts deep detector training, while textual class information can provide valuable semantic supervision. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for few-shot multispectral object detection due to their semantic priors learned from large-scale data.

Method: Adapt two VLM-based detectors (Grounding DINO and YOLO-World) to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual, and thermal modalities.

Result: VLM-based detectors excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, and achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings on FLIR and M3FD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, offering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current vision-language models underperform supervised baselines on agricultural classification tasks, with best VLM reaching ~62% accuracy vs. supervised YOLO11's superior performance. Evaluation methodology significantly affects results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of vision-language models (VLMs) for agricultural decision support, as they are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions but their performance on agricultural tasks remains poorly understood.

Method: Benchmarked diverse open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from AgML collection (162 classes across plant disease, pest/damage, and plant/weed species). Used zero-shot evaluation with multiple-choice and open-ended prompting, plus LLM-based semantic judging for open-ended responses.

Result: Zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform supervised YOLO11 baseline. Best VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches ~62% average accuracy with multiple-choice prompting; open-ended prompting yields much lower performance (<25%). LLM-based semantic judging improves open-ended accuracy (e.g., 21% to 30%). Qwen-VL-72B best open-source model. Plant/weed classification easier than pest/damage identification.

Conclusion: Current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transform ecologically worthless monocultural lawns into vibrant biotopes that boost urban biodiversity, moving beyond passive rewilding approaches.

Method: Uses ResNet50 pretrained on PlantNet300K for deep feature-space analysis to identify diverse vegetation patches, calculates global deviation metric for biodiversity estimation, and implements selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation.

Result: Strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming feasibility of deep visual diversity as proxy for ecological richness and effectiveness of the mowing decision approach.

Conclusion: The system successfully demonstrates that robotic mowers can actively enhance garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making, potentially transforming urban lawns into valuable biotopes.

Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

TL;DR: A method to generate video-action pairs from text instructions using a dual diffusion model with cross-modal attention, enabling robotic policy learning without action annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robotic policy learning either use two-stage pipelines that limit cross-modal information sharing, or adapt single-modal diffusion models that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. There's a lack of action annotations for video diffusion models, preventing their full use in robotic learning.

Method: Extends a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel action diffusion model to preserve pretrained knowledge. Introduces Bridge Attention for effective cross-modal interaction between video and action modalities. Includes an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets.

Result: Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets show the method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning by automatically providing action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the lack of action annotations.

Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

TL;DR: A closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving that generates adversarial interactions in real-world scenes to create safety-critical corner cases for testing model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical corner cases are difficult to collect in the real world but crucial for evaluating autonomous driving systems. Existing adversarial evaluation methods work in simplified simulation environments but not for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes a closed-loop evaluation platform with two main components: 1) A real-world image generator based on flow matching that efficiently generates realistic driving images from traffic environment information, and 2) An adversarial traffic policy that models challenging interactions to create corner cases that current systems struggle with.

Result: The platform successfully generates realistic driving images efficiently and can evaluate performance degradation of end-to-end models (UniAD and VAD) in corner cases. The adversarial policy effectively identifies model vulnerabilities and performance issues in safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: The platform effectively detects potential issues in end-to-end autonomous driving models, facilitating improved safety and robustness by identifying vulnerabilities through adversarial testing in realistic corner cases.

Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model that predicts high angular resolution FOD from low angular resolution dMRI using FOD-patch adapters, voxel-level conditioning, and SH attention modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) has limited accuracy for fiber orientation distribution estimation, while multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires long scanning times that limit clinical applicability. Diffusion models show promise but face challenges due to the large number of spherical harmonic coefficients in FOD.

Method: Proposes a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model with three key components: 1) FOD-patch adapter incorporating prior brain anatomy for efficient patch-based learning, 2) voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance global understanding, and 3) SH attention module to learn complex correlations between spherical harmonic coefficients.

Result: The method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion model effectively addresses the challenge of generating high-quality HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD by incorporating anatomical priors, global conditioning, and specialized attention mechanisms for spherical harmonic coefficients.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary 3D detection methods still require user-specified classes during training and inference. The authors aim to create a truly automatic system that generates class names without any human input.

Method: Proposes AV3DOD framework using 2D vision-language models with three key components: image captioning to generate semantic candidates, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. Introduces Semantic Score (SS) metric to evaluate generated class name quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Surpasses previous SOTA (CoDA) by 3.48 overall mAP and achieves 24.5% relative improvement in Semantic Score on ScanNetV2.

Conclusion: AV3DOD successfully demonstrates auto-vocabulary 3D object detection that automatically generates meaningful class names without user input, advancing the field toward more autonomous 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art human pose estimation models are too computationally expensive for edge deployment, while existing lightweight models sacrifice too much accuracy. There's a need for models that balance efficiency and accuracy for edge devices.

Method: LAPX builds on previous LAP work by incorporating self-attention to capture global context, advancing stage design, and refining lightweight attention modules within an Hourglass network architecture.

Result: Achieves competitive results on MPII and COCO benchmarks with only 2.3M parameters, demonstrating real-time performance suitable for edge devices.

Conclusion: LAPX successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in human pose estimation, providing a viable solution for edge device deployment with minimal parameter count and real-time performance.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera calibration is essential for photogrammetry and 3D vision, but existing methods may lack reliability, controllability, or require complex setups. The paper aims to provide a more reliable and flexible calibration solution using a collimator system.

Method: Uses a designed collimator system to create a controlled calibration environment. Introduces an angle invariance constraint based on the collimator's optical geometry, proving that relative motion follows a spherical motion model (reducing from 6DOF to 3DOF pure rotation). Develops closed-form linear solvers for multiple images, minimal solver for two images, and a single collimator image calibration algorithm that eliminates camera motion requirements.

Result: Evaluated in synthetic and real-world experiments, verifying feasibility of collimator-based calibration and demonstrating superiority over existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The collimator system provides a reliable calibration environment, and the proposed method offers flexible, fast calibration with reduced motion requirements, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart livestock management needs automated detection of cattle interactions (e.g., for estrus detection), but existing methods face challenges due to the rarity of such interactions and lack of comprehensive behavioral datasets with interactions.

Method: 1) Learn action latent space from large-scale cattle action dataset; 2) Embed rare interactions via fine-tuning pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning; 3) Construct unified latent space of actions and interactions; 4) Develop practical system integrating video and GPS inputs.

Result: Experiments on commercial-scale pasture demonstrate accurate interaction detection compared to baselines. The method effectively handles rare interaction events through data-efficient approach.

Conclusion: CattleAct provides a practical, data-efficient solution for automated cattle interaction detection, enabling smart livestock management applications like estrus detection with available implementation for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dual-spectral CT reconstruction including channel imbalance and near-interface artifacts, while leveraging both physical knowledge and data-driven approaches for improved accuracy.

Method: Two-stage hybrid framework: 1) Knowledge-driven phase using OPMT for fast basis material decomposition, 2) Data-driven phase using ResDynUNet++ (UNet++ with residual dynamic convolution blocks) to refine intermediate solution and remove artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the method's efficacy and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework successfully integrates iterative and deep learning methods for DSCT reconstruction, effectively addressing key challenges and producing clean, accurate final solutions.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegGraph: A novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation using SAM segment graph propagation to effectively aggregate 2D foundation model knowledge to 3D while preserving geometric structures and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for few-shot 3D part segmentation either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglect high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. There's a need to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D.

Method: SegGraph uses a SAM segment graph-based propagation method that explicitly learns geometric features from SAM's segmentation masks. It constructs a segment graph (similar to an atlas) where nodes represent segments and edges capture spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. A novel view-direction-weighted fusion maps segment features to 3D points while attenuating contributions from low-quality segments.

Result: Extensive experiments on PartNet-E show SegGraph outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9% mIoU. Further analysis reveals particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating superior geometric understanding.

Conclusion: SegGraph effectively addresses the challenge of aggregating 2D foundation model knowledge to 3D for few-shot part segmentation by explicitly modeling geometric structures through segment graph propagation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with strong geometric understanding capabilities.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuning strategies for VLMs in UDA primarily align marginal distributions but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, leading to class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability.

Method: C-DGPA uses a dual-branch architecture: 1) marginal distribution alignment branch with dynamic adversarial training, and 2) conditional distribution alignment branch with Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to standardize semantic prompt understanding and prevent source domain over-reliance.

Result: Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 show C-DGPA achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

Conclusion: The dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowledge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensuring domain-invariant and semantically discriminative representations for UDA tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras suffer from domain gap problems when deployment conditions differ from training data, particularly with day-night lighting differences. This performance degradation in autonomous driving systems motivates finding alternative sensors that maintain consistent performance across lighting conditions.

Method: The paper proposes using event cameras instead of traditional cameras for end-to-end driving. Event cameras are evaluated as an alternative sensor modality that can handle lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments or domain adaptation techniques.

Result: Event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions compared to traditional cameras. They exhibit domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: Event cameras are a promising alternative to traditional cameras for autonomous driving systems, particularly for addressing the day-night domain gap problem. They offer more consistent performance across lighting conditions without requiring additional domain adaptation adjustments.

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space.

TL;DR: VALOR introduces a reinforcement learning framework with Group-Relative Proximal Optimization to improve visual grounding and clinical accuracy in radiology report generation by aligning vision and language representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Medical Vision-Language Models struggle with generating visually grounded and clinically accurate radiology reports, often suffering from hallucinations due to poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. Existing approaches rely on large labeled corpora, costly preference data, or retrieval methods that don't adequately address these alignment issues.

Method: VALOR uses a two-stage reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework with Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). Stage 1 improves the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology. Stage 2 aligns the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, guiding attention toward image regions most relevant to diagnosis.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art radiology report generation methods.

Conclusion: VALOR effectively addresses the critical challenge of generating both visually grounded and clinically accurate radiology reports by improving cross-modal alignment through reinforcement learning, representing an important advancement in automated healthcare workflows.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

*Zilin Wang,Sangwoo Mo,Stella X. Yu,Sima Behpour,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OAK is a novel model for open ad-hoc visual categorization that combines CLIP's image-text alignment with visual clustering to dynamically discover and expand categories from few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents need adaptive categorization to handle changing tasks, unlike fixed common categories. Ad-hoc categories are created dynamically for specific goals, requiring systems that can discover underlying context and expand categories through semantic extension and visual clustering.

Method: OAK introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP model, then optimizes using both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective, leveraging similar perceptual mechanisms between ad-hoc and common categories.

Result: OAK achieves state-of-the-art performance on Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, with 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood (surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%). It also produces interpretable saliency maps that focus on relevant visual features for different categorization tasks.

Conclusion: OAK enables adaptive and generalizable categorization while promoting transparency and trust through interpretable saliency maps, demonstrating effective open ad-hoc categorization by combining semantic and visual learning objectives.

Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.
  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.
  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.

*Amit Vishwakarma,K. S. Subrahamanian Moosath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, bounded Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence for comparing 3D point clouds represented as Gaussian Mixture Models on a statistical manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geometric metrics (Hausdorff, Chamfer distances) fail to capture global statistical structure and are sensitive to outliers, while existing KL divergence approximations for GMMs can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values.

Method: Represent point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models on a statistical manifold, prove GMMs form a statistical manifold, and propose Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds for numerical stability.

Result: MSKL provides stable, monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations in experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset).

Conclusion: The information geometric framework with MSKL divergence offers a robust, numerically stable approach for 3D point cloud shape analysis that better captures statistical structure than traditional geometric metrics.

Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

TL;DR: EDN: An encoder-decoder network that transforms random Gaussian noise into high-quality initial noise for diffusion-based novel view synthesis models, improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for novel view synthesis show that certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better results, but there's no dedicated learning framework to generate such noise from random Gaussian noise.

Method: 1) Design discretized Euler inversion to inject image semantic information into random noise, creating paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. 2) Propose encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise.

Result: EDN can be seamlessly integrated into various NVS models (SV3D, MV-Adapter) and achieves significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed EDN framework effectively learns to generate high-quality initial noise from random noise, enhancing diffusion-based novel view synthesis models without architectural changes.

Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

*Justin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVD-based low-rank matrix approximations for image compression are evaluated but found to be consistently worse than standard formats like JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP, with compression efficiency issues especially at low error levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Images constitute a large portion of internet data, making efficient compression crucial for reducing storage and bandwidth requirements. The study aims to investigate whether Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations can provide effective image compression solutions.

Method: The research applies Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations to both grayscale and multichannel images. Performance is evaluated using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio metrics to assess compression efficiency.

Result: While low-rank approximations can produce visually similar images to originals, the compression efficiency is consistently worse than established formats (JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, SVD compression can even produce files larger than the original images.

Conclusion: SVD-based low-rank approximation methods are not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression applications, despite their ability to produce visually acceptable results.

Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

TL;DR: ARMFlow is an autoregressive framework for real-time 3D human reaction generation that addresses motion fidelity, real-time inference, and autoregressive adaptability challenges simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve high motion fidelity, real-time inference, and autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios in 3D human reaction generation.

Method: ARMFlow uses a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework with causal context encoder and MLP-based velocity predictor, plus Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) to reduce error accumulation in autoregressive generation.

Result: ARMFlow surpasses existing online methods by over 40% in FID on InterHuman and InterX datasets, matches offline state-of-the-art performance using only partial sequence conditions, and achieves fastest inference among offline methods with ReMFlow variant.

Conclusion: ARMFlow successfully addresses the three key challenges of 3D human reaction generation through its autoregressive framework with BSCE, enabling high-quality real-time online generation that matches offline performance.

Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

*Qi Zhang,Yunfei Gong,Zhidan Xie,Zhizi Wang,Antoni B. Chan,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks using model ranking constraints to address limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view crowd counting suffers from limited datasets due to difficulty in collecting and annotating multi-view images. Existing approaches either use synthetic data or semi/weakly-supervised methods, but more effective semi-supervised approaches are needed.

Method: Two semi-supervised frameworks based on ranking multi-view fusion models: 1) Vanilla model ranking predictions (predictions with fewer views ≤ predictions with more views), 2) Ranking model uncertainties (uncertainties with more views ≤ uncertainties with fewer views). These constraints are incorporated into training with limited labeled data.

Result: Experiments show advantages over other semi-supervised counting methods, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed model ranking approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks with model ranking constraints effectively address data limitations and outperform existing semi-supervised methods.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIM_PSR_k is a deep learning-based pixel super-resolution framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from low-resolution data, enabling 5x super-resolution and 25x space-bandwidth product increase for faster, higher-quality clinical FLIM imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of FLIM is limited by long pixel dwell times and low SNR, creating strict resolution-speed trade-offs. There's a need for methods that can overcome these limitations to enable faster, higher-resolution FLIM imaging for translational applications.

Method: FLIM_PSR_k uses a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework for multi-channel pixel super-resolution. It reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to 5x increased pixel size, offering faster inference than diffusion model alternatives.

Result: The method achieves reliable 5x super-resolution factor, resulting in 25x increase in space-bandwidth product. It reveals fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics in blind testing on patient-derived tumor tissue samples.

Conclusion: FLIM_PSR_k advances FLIM toward faster, higher-resolution implementations compatible with low-NA and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for clinical translation by overcoming current resolution-speed limitations.

Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text editing in images remains largely unexplored despite being a challenging frontier in visual generation. Current approaches struggle with generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence, creating a gap in evaluation capabilities.

Method: Introduces TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark focusing on text-centric regions in images. Goes beyond basic pixel manipulations to emphasize reasoning-intensive editing scenarios requiring understanding of physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. Proposes a novel evaluation dimension called Semantic Expectation (SE) to measure reasoning ability for maintaining semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. The benchmark establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning.

Conclusion: TextEditBench addresses a fundamental but overlooked capability in multimodal generation, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework that pushes the field toward better reasoning-intensive text editing in images.

Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFLAN is a two-stage generative framework for floor plan synthesis that separates topological planning from geometric realization, using specialized neural architectures to address architectural reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle with architectural reasoning - capturing topological relationships over geometric instantiation, functional constraint propagation, and circulation patterns from connectivity decisions. Current methods often fail to properly structure the floor plan generation problem.

Method: Two-stage decomposition: Stage A uses dual-encoder convolutional architecture to sequentially allocate room centroids via discrete probability maps. Stage B constructs heterogeneous graph linking rooms to boundaries, then applies Transformer-augmented GNN to jointly regress room boundaries.

Result: The paper introduces GFLAN framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization, departing from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation.

Conclusion: GFLAN provides a principled approach to floor plan generation that better captures architectural reasoning by separating topological relationships from geometric instantiation, addressing fundamental challenges in automated floor plan synthesis.

Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

TL;DR: LaverNet is a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network with only 362K parameters that addresses challenges of time-varying degradations through selective degradation-agnostic feature propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current all-in-one video restoration methods face two key challenges: 1) degradations can dominate temporal modeling, confusing models to focus on artifacts rather than video content, and 2) existing approaches rely on large models that conceal underlying difficulties in handling multiple degradations.

Method: Proposes LaverNet, a lightweight network with only 362K parameters. Introduces a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames to mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling.

Result: Despite having less than 1% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable and even superior performance across benchmarks, demonstrating that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network.

Conclusion: LaverNet successfully addresses the challenges of time-varying degradations in video restoration through selective feature propagation, proving that effective all-in-one restoration doesn't require large models and can be achieved with lightweight architectures.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored all-in-one video restoration, which handles multiple degradations with a unified model. However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of multicollinearity in design matrices when using least squares estimation for UAV target localization under challenging conditions (long distances, small intersection angles, large inclination angles), which causes ill-conditioned problems, instability, and low robustness.

Method: Proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation that combines sequential imagery (rich scene information) with laser ranging (high precision). Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate multicollinearity issues that occur under limited observation conditions.

Result: The method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information sources. Ridge estimation effectively enhances robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

Conclusion: The ridge estimation-based fusion approach successfully addresses multicollinearity problems in UAV target localization, improving both accuracy and robustness under challenging observation conditions.

Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

### [71] [Collaborative Edge-to-Server Inference for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16349)
*Soochang Song,Yongjune Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A collaborative edge-to-server VLM framework that reduces communication costs by selectively retransmitting only essential image regions when confidence is low, maintaining accuracy while minimizing data transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current edge-to-server VLM deployments transmit entire images, but resizing to encoder resolution loses fine details, causing accuracy degradation. There's a need to reduce communication costs while preserving inference accuracy.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Server performs initial inference on global image, identifies RoI using VLM attention, computes min-entropy confidence measure; 2) If confidence low (min-entropy exceeds threshold), requests detail-preserved local image of RoI from edge device, then refines inference using both global and local images.

Result: Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show significant reduction in communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy compared to traditional full-image transmission approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed selective retransmission framework effectively balances communication efficiency and inference accuracy for edge-to-server VLM deployments by transmitting only essential visual content when needed.

Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

*Tao Hu,Weiyu Zhou,Yanjie Tu,Peng Wu,Wei Dong,Qingsen Yan,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMODiff is a one-step diffusion framework that uses gain maps for efficient multi-exposure HDR reconstruction, addressing limitations of traditional latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) show promise for HDR reconstruction but face three key challenges: limited dynamic-range representation from 8-bit latent compression, high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and content hallucination from generative nature.

Method: Reformulates HDR reconstruction as gain map (GM) estimation, where GM encodes extended dynamic range while keeping same bit depth as LDR images. Uses regression-based estimate as initialization for single-step denoising, and leverages regression priors to guide both denoising and latent decoding to suppress hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy.

Result: GMODiff performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods and is 100× faster than previous LDM-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework effectively addresses the limitations of applying LDMs to HDR reconstruction, achieving both high quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EverybodyDance addresses identity correspondence in multi-character animation by using an Identity Matching Graph and Mask-Query Attention to ensure characters maintain correct identities during position swaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-driven character animation works well for single characters but struggles with multi-character scenarios, especially when characters swap positions. The core challenge is maintaining correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between reference and generated frames.

Method: Proposes EverybodyDance with Identity Matching Graph (IMG) modeling characters as nodes in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Uses Mask-Query Attention (MQA) to compute affinity weights. Formalizes IC correctness as a graph structural metric and optimizes it during training. Includes identity-embedded guidance, multi-scale matching, and pre-classified sampling strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both Identity Correspondence and visual fidelity. Introduces Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark for multi-character IC correctness.

Conclusion: EverybodyDance provides a systematic solution for correct identity correspondence in multi-character animation, addressing the core challenge of maintaining character identities during position swaps through graph-based modeling and targeted optimization strategies.

Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

*Mariam Hassan,Bastien Van Delft,Wuyang Li,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FVG decomposes T2V generation into three specialized stages: LLM reasoning for initial scene description, T2I model for anchor frame synthesis, and video model for temporal animation, improving quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V diffusion models often fail at complex scene composition and logical temporal instructions, with many errors stemming from inability to create semantically correct initial frames.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) LLM rewrites video prompt to describe only initial scene, 2) T2I model synthesizes high-quality anchor frame, 3) video model finetuned to understand anchor focuses on animation.

Result: Sets new SOTA on T2V CompBench benchmark, significantly improves all tested models on VBench2, enables 70% reduction in sampling steps without performance loss, leading to substantial speed-up.

Conclusion: Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis by decoupling scene composition from temporal animation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

*Zhanwei Li,Liang Li,Jiawan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFDAN is a novel domain adaptation framework that aligns features in the frequency domain to address medical image segmentation data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art results on vitiligo and retinal vessel segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation suffers from scarce high-quality annotated data due to time-consuming manual annotation. Domain adaptation can help transfer knowledge from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, but existing methods may not effectively handle domain shifts in medical imaging.

Method: AFDAN (Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network) integrates three core components: 1) Adversarial Domain Learning Module for feature transfer, 2) Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module for blending frequency representations, and 3) Spatial-Frequency Integration Module combining both frequency and spatial features for enhanced segmentation accuracy.

Result: AFDAN achieves 90.9% IoU on the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset for vitiligo segmentation and 82.6% IoU on the DRIVE retinal vessel segmentation benchmark, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed AFDAN framework effectively addresses data scarcity in medical image segmentation through frequency domain alignment and cross-domain knowledge transfer, demonstrating superior performance on both vitiligo and retinal vessel segmentation tasks.

Abstract: High-quality annotated data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate segmentation. However, such data for medical image segmentation are often scarce due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*Haodi He,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting for unified face reconstruction from uncalibrated images, enabling standard graphics pipeline integration and neural texture creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified 3D representation of human faces from uncalibrated images that can be integrated into standard graphics pipelines, overcoming limitations of existing neural representations like NeRFs.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting with segmentation annotations for semantic alignment, constrains Gaussians to triangulated surfaces, transforms splats into view-dependent neural textures, and employs relightable models for texture-lighting disentanglement.

Result: Achieves neutral pose reconstruction from only 11 images (vs. long videos), produces structured Gaussian Splat reconstructions, generates delit high-resolution albedo textures, and enables text-driven asset creation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges neural representations with traditional graphics pipelines, offering high visual fidelity without modifying existing assets or pipeline components, while enabling training with disparate images under incompatible lighting.

Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.

*Liyuan Deng,Hao Guo,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Huaxi Huang,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepLLM enables LLMs to process 3D Boundary Representation models by converting Breps to graphs, aligning them with text embeddings, and fine-tuning LLMs for 3D understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with 3D Brep models containing complex geometric and topological information, creating a modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Cross-modal alignment pre-training with adaptive UV sampling, hierarchical BrepEncoder, and CLIP text embedding alignment; 2) Multi-stage LLM fine-tuning with semantic mapping, LLM fine-tuning, and Mixture-of-Query Experts for geometric diversity.

Result: BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks, demonstrating effective bridging of 3D geometry and language.

Conclusion: BrepLLM successfully enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between 3D geometry and natural language through innovative graph representation and multi-stage training.

Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountZES is a training-free zero-shot object counting framework that progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages to accurately count unseen object categories specified only by class names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object counting methods have limitations: open-vocabulary detectors produce multi-instance candidates, while random patch sampling fails to accurately delineate object instances. There's a need for better exemplar selection in zero-shot counting scenarios.

Method: CountZES uses three progressive stages: 1) Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE) refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars; 2) Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE) uses density-driven self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent exemplars; 3) Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE) reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES achieves superior performance among zero-shot object counting methods and generalizes effectively across natural, aerial, and medical domains.

Conclusion: CountZES provides an effective training-free framework for zero-shot object counting that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness through progressive exemplar discovery, outperforming existing methods across multiple domains.

Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

TL;DR: Training-free method improves subject consistency in text-to-image diffusion models by refining text embeddings to suppress semantic entanglement, outperforming existing baselines without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with subject consistency across multiple outputs for visual storytelling. Existing approaches require computationally expensive fine-tuning or per-subject optimization, while training-free methods like 1Prompt1Story suffer from semantic leakage and text misalignment.

Method: Proposes a simple training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics, preventing embeddings across frames from becoming entangled.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines without requiring model fine-tuning or per-subject optimization.

Conclusion: The training-free geometric approach effectively solves semantic entanglement in text embeddings, enabling better subject consistency for visual storytelling applications while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new approach for generating gaze-primed human reaching motions using diffusion models, with curated dataset of 23.7K sequences and novel evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion generation is challenging but important for creating realistic human behavior. The paper focuses specifically on gaze priming behavior - where humans spot objects/locations from a distance before approaching them - which is a well-studied but underexplored aspect of motion generation.

Method: 1) Curated 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences from five public datasets (HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, GIMO). 2) Pre-trained a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model. 3) Fine-tuned the model conditioned on goal pose or location using the curated sequences. 4) Introduced new evaluation metrics including 'Prime Success' for gaze priming behavior.

Result: On the largest dataset (HD-EPIC), the model achieved 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on goal object location, demonstrating effective generation of gaze-primed reaching motions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully generates realistic gaze-primed human reaching motions, with the curated dataset and novel evaluation metrics providing a foundation for future research in this specific aspect of human motion generation.

Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNOW is a training-free framework that integrates VLM semantics with 3D geometry and temporal dynamics for unified 4D scene understanding, using object proposals, multimodal token encoding, and a 4D Scene Graph for robotic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots need spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments. Current approaches have limitations: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lack 3D geometry and temporal grounding, while geometric perception is semantically sparse. There's a need to combine semantic priors with geometric and temporal information for reliable navigation and interaction.

Method: SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds. It uses HDBSCAN clustering for object-level proposals to guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each region is encoded via Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP) to produce multimodal tokens capturing semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG). A lightweight SLAM backend provides spatial anchoring and global reference alignment.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance in several settings. The framework demonstrates the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

Conclusion: SNOW successfully integrates VLM semantics with geometric and temporal information through a unified 4D Scene Graph, providing a queryable world model that enables VLMs to interpret spatial structure and temporal dynamics for improved autonomous robotic systems.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

*Senmao Li,Kai Wang,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Jian Yang,Yaxing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StageVAR is a stage-aware acceleration framework for Visual Autoregressive models that speeds up generation by preserving early critical steps while pruning/approximating later detail-refining steps, achieving 3.4x speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from high computational complexity and runtime at large-scale steps. Existing acceleration methods rely on manual step selection and ignore the varying importance of different stages in the generation process.

Method: StageVAR analyzes generation stages and finds early steps are critical for semantic/structure preservation while later steps mainly refine details. It introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy exploiting semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations without additional training.

Result: StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only 0.01 drop on GenEval and 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines.

Conclusion: Stage-aware design is a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation, demonstrating that systematic analysis of generation stages enables effective acceleration without compromising quality.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

*Yuan Li,Yahan Yu,Youyuan Lin,Yong-Hao Yang,Chenhui Chu,Shin'ya Nishida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for blind image quality assessment that learns human-like perception-reasoning capabilities by using human annotations as rewards, achieving competitive performance while improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, but current BIQA models lack human-like reasoning capabilities and self-consistent judgment processes. The authors aim to develop models that can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning for better interpretability in quality assessment.

Method: 1) Collect human evaluation data capturing perception-reasoning aspects; 2) Use reinforcement learning with human annotations as reward signals to guide model toward human-like perception; 3) Design additional reward to enable self-consistent reasoning by inferring quality purely from self-generated descriptions.

Result: Achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems (Pearson/Spearman correlations). More importantly, achieves ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (vs 0.443 baseline) on over 1,000 human-annotated samples, showing substantial coverage of human explanations and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach successfully develops models with human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA, marking progress toward more transparent and human-aligned quality assessment systems through reinforcement learning with human feedback.

Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

### [84] [Smile on the Face, Sadness in the Eyes: Bridging the Emotion Gap with a Multimodal Dataset of Eye and Facial Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16485)
*Kejun Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Lin Wei,Chang Tang,Yibing Zhan,Zijing Chen,Zhe Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMER dataset and EMERT model that use eye behaviors to bridge the gap between facial expression recognition and genuine emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expressions are often social tools rather than genuine emotional manifestations, creating a gap between FER and true ER. Eye behaviors provide important emotional cues to address this limitation.

Method: 1) Created EMER dataset using spontaneous emotion induction with eye movement sequences, fixation maps, and facial videos. 2) Developed EMERT model with modality-adversarial feature decoupling and multitask Transformer to integrate eye behaviors with facial expressions.

Result: EMERT outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin. Seven benchmark protocols show eye behaviors significantly enhance robust emotion recognition.

Conclusion: Eye behaviors are crucial for bridging the gap between FER and ER. The EMER dataset and EMERT model advance robust emotion recognition by complementing facial expressions with eye behavior analysis.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.

*Huma Hafeez,Matthew Garratt,Jo Plested,Sankaran Iyer,Arcot Sowmya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-4K: An efficient real-time object detection framework for 4K panoramic images that reduces latency by 75% while improving accuracy compared to standard YOLO11.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360-degree images present challenges for object detection due to spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors like YOLO struggle with computational demands of 4K+ resolution imagery typical in panoramic vision.

Method: Introduces YOLO11-4K with: 1) Novel multi-scale detection head with P2 layer for better small object detection, 2) GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity while maintaining representational power, 3) Manually annotated CVIP360 dataset with 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes for evaluation.

Result: Achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3ms inference per frame, representing 75% latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3ms) while improving accuracy (0.95 vs 0.908 mAP).

Conclusion: YOLO11-4K balances efficiency and precision for robust object detection in 360-degree environments, making it suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and AR.

Abstract: The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

### [86] [PoseMoE: Mixture-of-Experts Network for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16494)
*Mengyuan Liu,Jiajie Liu,Jinyan Zhang,Wenhao Li,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseMoE: A Mixture-of-Experts network that disentangles 2D pose and depth feature encoding to improve monocular 3D human pose estimation by reducing depth uncertainty's negative impact on 2D pose features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lifting-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation encode detected 2D poses and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, which introduces depth uncertainty to the 2D pose features and limits overall accuracy. The paper reveals that jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental when depth is initially unknown, but beneficial when depth is refined first.

Method: Proposes PoseMoE with two key components: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules separately refine well-detected 2D pose features and learn depth features, disentangling their encoding to reduce depth uncertainty's influence on 2D features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module that aggregates spatio-temporal contextual information through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth experts.

Result: Extensive experiments show PoseMoE outperforms conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Conclusion: The depth representation is pivotal for 3D human pose estimation. Disentangling 2D pose and depth feature encoding through a mixture-of-experts approach reduces the negative impact of depth uncertainty and improves overall estimation accuracy compared to traditional entangled encoding methods.

Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

TL;DR: VenusBench-GD is a comprehensive bilingual GUI grounding benchmark spanning multiple platforms with hierarchical evaluation, showing general multimodal models match specialized GUI models on basic tasks but advanced tasks still favor specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding benchmarks have limitations: insufficient data volume, narrow domain coverage, single-platform focus, and require specialized domain knowledge. There's a need for comprehensive, multi-platform evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created VenusBench-GD with: (1) large-scale cross-platform benchmark with extensive application coverage, diverse UI elements, and rich annotations; (2) high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks; (3) hierarchical task taxonomy dividing grounding into basic and advanced categories with six distinct subtasks.

Result: General-purpose multimodal models now match or surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. Advanced tasks still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness.

Conclusion: Comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks are necessary for GUI grounding. The benchmark reveals current limitations of specialized models and the progress of general multimodal models, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation approaches.

Abstract: GUI grounding is a critical component in building capable GUI agents. However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness. These results underscore the necessity of comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks.

*Qiushuo Cheng,Jingjing Liu,Catherine Morgan,Alan Whone,Majid Mirmehdi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining with snippet discrimination and U-shaped feature fusion improves skeleton-based temporal action localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods work well for skeleton-based action recognition but struggle with temporal action localization, which requires temporally sensitive features to detect precise action boundaries where subtle frame differences matter.

Method: 1) Snippet discrimination pretext task: densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and uses contrastive learning to distinguish them across videos. 2) U-shaped module: fuses intermediate features from strong skeleton action recognition backbones to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization.

Result: Consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. Achieves state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

Conclusion: The proposed snippet discrimination pretext task and U-shaped feature fusion module effectively address the challenges of skeleton-based temporal action localization, enabling better detection of action boundaries through temporally sensitive features.

Abstract: The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

*Hossein Javidnia*

TL;DR: MAGINet is a deep learning system for intrinsic decomposition of face images that predicts high-resolution diffuse albedo and five additional rendering passes for photorealistic face relighting and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is essential for photorealistic relighting, digital doubles, and AR effects, but existing methods have limitations in quality and completeness.

Method: Uses hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-channel attention, multi-scale feature fusion to predict 512×512 albedo, then refines to 1024×1024 with RefinementNet, and finally generates five additional rendering passes using Pix2PixHD-based translator.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and significantly improved fidelity for complete rendering stack compared to prior methods, enabling high-quality relighting and material editing.

Conclusion: MAGINet provides a comprehensive solution for face intrinsic decomposition that produces six physically-based rendering passes for photorealistic face manipulation applications.

Abstract: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is a prerequisite for photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and augmented-reality effects. This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods. The resulting passes enable high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces.

*Zhiwei Li,Yitian Pang,Weining Wang,Zhenan Sun,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTP is a lightweight test-time defense framework for CLIP models that detects adversarial inputs via cosine similarity shift from spatial padding, then uses trainable padding to restore attention patterns for robust predictions while preserving clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models like CLIP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in safety-critical scenarios. Existing defenses either require costly adversarial fine-tuning with labeled data, or test-time strategies that fail to reliably distinguish clean from adversarial inputs, preventing optimal robustness and accuracy.

Method: TTP performs adversarial detection by computing cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings before and after spatial padding, using a universal threshold. For detected adversarial cases, it uses trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns with similarity-aware ensemble strategy. For clean inputs, it leaves them unchanged or optionally integrates test-time adaptation techniques.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy.

Conclusion: TTP provides an effective lightweight defense framework that addresses limitations of previous approaches by combining reliable adversarial detection with targeted adaptation at inference time, achieving both robustness and accuracy without costly retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

TL;DR: N3D-VLM is a unified framework that integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding beyond conventional 2D multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. They can only answer questions based on 2D images without true 3D understanding.

Method: Proposes N3D-VLM framework with native 3D object perception capabilities for direct 3D object localization from textual descriptions. Uses scalable data construction pipeline leveraging depth estimation to lift 2D annotations into 3D space, generating large-scale 3D grounding and spatial QA datasets for joint training of 3D localization and reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks and consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning. Data pipeline yields over 6x larger dataset than existing single-image 3D detection datasets.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully integrates native 3D perception with interpretable spatial reasoning, advancing multimodal models beyond 2D understanding to comprehensive 3D scene comprehension with both precise grounding and structured reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create persistent 4D reconstructions that capture not only currently visible scene parts but also previously viewed elements, enabling complete replayable scene histories and object permanence.

Method: Decomposes scene into rigid 3D primitives with estimated motion, uses dense 2D correspondences to jointly infer rigid motion through optimization, and employs motion-grouping techniques to extrapolate motion for invisible objects.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on object scanning and multi-object datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively, enabling 4D spatio-temporal awareness with replayable 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: The system successfully achieves complete and persistent 4D scene reconstruction from casual monocular video, providing object permanence and enabling novel applications in dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.
  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.
  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Yin Zhang,Yongqiang Zhang,Yaoyue Zheng,Bogdan Raducanu,Dan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Tune: A novel fine-tuning strategy for Vision Foundation Models that identifies and disentangles causal vs. non-causal factors in feature frequency spectra to improve domain generalization in semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFM fine-tuning methods overlook artifacts from long-term pre-training that hinder domain generalization. These artifacts are associated with non-causal factors residing in low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum, degrading performance on unseen domains.

Method: Proposes Causal-Tune: 1) Extract frequency spectrum of features from each layer using DCT, 2) Apply Gaussian band-pass filter to separate causal vs. non-causal components, 3) Introduce causal-aware learnable tokens in frequency domain to refine causal components while discarding non-causal ones, 4) Transform refined features back to spatial domain via inverse DCT for next layer processing.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance across cross-domain tasks, particularly under adverse weather conditions. Achieves +4.8% mIoU improvement over baseline in snow conditions.

Conclusion: Causal-Tune effectively identifies and disentangles causal factors from VFM features, suppressing non-causal artifacts to achieve more robust domain generalization in semantic segmentation, especially in challenging weather scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

TL;DR: CRONOS is a unified framework for 3D medical scan forecasting that supports both discrete and continuous timestamps, enabling many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans with irregular sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for 3D medical scan forecasting have limitations: they rely on single prior scans, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which restricts voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling conditions common in medical imaging.

Method: CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at arbitrary times, operating directly in 3D voxel space. It supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in a unified model.

Result: Across three public datasets (Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI), CRONOS outperforms other baselines while remaining computationally competitive. It's the first model to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data.

Conclusion: CRONOS provides an effective framework for multi-context, continuous-time forecasting of 3D medical scans, with plans to release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking in this important area.

Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment.

CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkiLa enables MLLMs to generate visual embeddings (latent sketch tokens) as visual thoughts during reasoning, allowing unified visual-text imagination without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack visual imagination capabilities - they can't form flexible visual-text interactions during thinking like humans do. Humans can imagine visually without predefined toolkits because they process visual and text information in a unified brain space.

Method: Proposes Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa) paradigm that expands MLLMs' auto-regressive capabilities to generate continuous visual embeddings (latent sketch tokens) as visual thoughts. Uses dynamic alternation between textual thinking mode and visual sketching mode during multi-step reasoning, with latent visual semantics reconstruction to ground the sketch tokens semantically.

Result: SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enables MLLMs to perform unified multi-modal reasoning with visual imagination capabilities, bridging the gap between visual understanding and visual imagination in AI systems.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

*Shaohua Wu,Tong Yu,Shenling Wang,Xudong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Yuan-TecSwin is a text-conditioned diffusion model that replaces CNN blocks with Swin-transformer blocks to improve long-range semantic understanding, achieving state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The locality of convolution operations in CNN-based diffusion models limits their ability to understand long-range semantic information, which is crucial for high-quality image synthesis.

Method: Replaces CNN blocks with Swin-transformer blocks in encoder and decoder; improves text-image alignment through better text encoder, effective text embedding utilization, and careful text condition incorporation; uses adapted time step search across diffusion stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark; improves inference performance by 10% with adapted time step search; generates images indistinguishable from human-painted ones in human evaluation.

Conclusion: Yuan-TecSwin demonstrates that transformer-based architectures can significantly improve diffusion models' non-local modeling ability and text-image alignment, leading to superior image generation quality without requiring additional models at different denoising stages.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

*Yifan Zhou,Zeqi Xiao,Tianyi Wei,Shuai Yang,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLSA introduces a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism that reduces quadratic attention costs to log-linear complexity for long token sequences in Diffusion Transformers, enabling efficient high-resolution image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) face quadratic self-attention costs that limit scaling to long token sequences. Existing Top-K sparse attention approaches still suffer from quadratic selection costs and require increasing K as sequences grow, making them inefficient for extremely long sequences.

Method: LLSA uses hierarchical Top-K selection that progressively adopts sparse selection with indices from previous levels, plus Hierarchical KV Enrichment to preserve global context with fewer tokens of different granularity. Includes high-performance GPU implementation using only sparse indices without dense attention masks.

Result: LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences while maintaining generation quality. Enables high-resolution pixel-space image generation without patchification or VAE encoding.

Conclusion: LLSA provides an efficient log-linear sparse attention mechanism for training long-sequence DiTs, offering a promising direction for scaling visual generation models to extremely long token sequences while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

*Kanwal Aftab,Graham Adams,Mark Scanlon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline uses electric sockets as indoor markers for forensic geolocation, achieving high accuracy in detection, classification, and country mapping despite data scarcity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor multimedia geolocation is underdeveloped but crucial for fighting serious crimes like human trafficking and child exploitation. While outdoor geolocation is well-explored, indoor geolocation faces challenges including similar room layouts, visual ambiguity, unreliable GPS, and limited datasets in sensitive domains.

Method: Three-stage deep learning pipeline: 1) YOLOv11 for plug socket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.843), 2) Xception for classifying sockets into 12 types (accuracy = 0.912), 3) mapping detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold). Created two datasets to address data scarcity: socket detection dataset (2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072) and classification dataset (3,187 images across 12 classes.

Result: Pipeline achieved high accuracy across all stages: 84.3% mAP for detection, 91.2% accuracy for socket type classification, and 96% accuracy for country mapping. Evaluated on realistic TraffickCam subset of Hotels-50K dataset with challenging conditions like poor lighting and amateur angles.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates practical progress toward real-world digital forensic applications by using standardized electric sockets as consistent indoor markers. The approach addresses data scarcity through dedicated dataset creation and shows robustness in realistic conditions. All code, models, and data are open source.

Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

### [100] [DeContext as Defense: Safe Image Editing in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16625)
*Linghui Shen,Mingyue Cui,Xingyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeContext is a defense method that uses targeted perturbations to weaken cross-attention pathways in diffusion models, preventing unauthorized in-context image editing while preserving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context diffusion models enable powerful image manipulation but raise serious privacy concerns, as personal images can be easily modified without consent for identity impersonation, misinformation, or malicious uses. Current defenses focus on personalized text-to-image generation, leaving large-scale DiT-based models vulnerable.

Method: DeContext injects small, targeted perturbations to weaken cross-attention pathways in multimodal attention layers, which are identified as the primary channels for contextual information propagation. The method focuses perturbations on early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks where context propagation is most dominant.

Result: Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. The method demonstrates that attention-based perturbations effectively decouple the link between input and output in in-context editing.

Conclusion: DeContext provides an efficient and robust defense against unauthorized image manipulation in in-context diffusion models by targeting attention mechanisms, offering a practical solution to privacy concerns while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARMAE is a noise-aware masked autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning that addresses data scarcity and speckle noise challenges through large-scale pre-training on SAR-1M dataset with speckle-aware enhancement and semantic alignment using optical priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imagery suffers from data scarcity and physically grounded speckle noise that hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning, limiting the effectiveness of deep learning approaches for SAR applications.

Method: Proposes SARMAE with three key components: 1) SAR-1M dataset - first million-scale SAR dataset with paired optical images, 2) Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE) - injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders for noise-aware learning, 3) Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC) - leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SARMAE effectively addresses SAR data scarcity and speckle noise challenges through self-supervised learning with noise-aware masked autoencoders and semantic alignment, achieving superior performance across various SAR downstream tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

### [102] [REGLUE Your Latents with Global and Local Semantics for Entangled Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16636)
*Giorgos Petsangourakis,Christos Sgouropoulos,Bill Psomas,Theodoros Giannakopoulos,Giorgos Sfikas,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REGLUE improves latent diffusion models by jointly modeling VAE latents, local patch-level semantics, and global image-level semantics from Vision Foundation Models within a single transformer backbone, achieving better image quality and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent diffusion models have limitations: their reconstruction-style denoising provides only indirect semantic supervision, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Existing approaches that inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models either use external alignment or only model a narrow slice of VFM features, underutilizing rich multi-layer spatial semantics.

Method: REGLUE introduces a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models: (1) VAE image latents, (2) compact local patch-level VFM semantics, and (3) global image-level [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. It uses a lightweight convolutional semantic compressor to nonlinearly aggregate multi-layer VFM features into low-dimensional spatially structured representations, which are entangled with VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID scores and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG methods. Experiments show that spatial VFM semantics are crucial, nonlinear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and global tokens with external alignment act as complementary lightweight enhancements.

Conclusion: REGLUE demonstrates that jointly modeling global-local-latent representations with nonlinear compression of multi-layer VFM features significantly improves latent diffusion model performance, providing more direct semantic supervision and better utilization of Vision Foundation Model semantics.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameDiffuser: An autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames from G-buffer data for interactive applications, using previous frame conditioning for temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based approaches for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis have limitations: single-image models lack temporal consistency, while video models are computationally expensive and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input.

Method: Autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates frames by conditioning on G-buffer data (geometry, materials, surface properties) and the model's own previous output. Uses dual-conditioning architecture combining ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. Implements three-stage training strategy for stable autoregressive generation, with environment-specific training for superior quality.

Result: FrameDiffuser maintains stable, temporally consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames, achieving superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches, while being suitable for interactive applications.

Conclusion: FrameDiffuser addresses critical limitations of existing approaches by providing temporally consistent, photorealistic neural rendering for interactive applications through autoregressive generation with G-buffer conditioning and previous frame guidance, demonstrating that environment-specific training yields better results than generalized approaches.

Abstract: Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

TL;DR: Subject fingerprinting method detects data leakage by mapping all images of a subject to distinct latent regions, achieving high re-identification accuracy on medical imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining open-source datasets can cause data leakage when the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance that doesn't reflect real-world generalization.

Method: Use subject fingerprinting with ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss to map all images of a subject to distinct regions in latent space, enabling subject re-identification via similarity matching. Evaluate on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in few-shot scenarios.

Result: High Mean-Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS-2021.

Conclusion: Subject fingerprinting effectively detects data leakage in medical imaging datasets, providing a reliable method to ensure proper dataset splits and prevent inflated performance metrics.

Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation shows deepfake detectors partially transfer to localized inpainting detection, performing well on medium/large manipulations and regeneration-style edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI enables realistic localized image manipulations (inpainting/editing) used in cybersecurity threats, but existing detectors for fully synthetic images lack characterization for localized edits.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors on localized inpainting detection using multiple datasets with diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques.

Result: Models trained on diverse generators show partial transferability to inpainting detection, reliably detecting medium/large manipulations and regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming ad hoc approaches.

Conclusion: Deepfake detectors exhibit useful transfer capabilities for localized inpainting detection, particularly for significant manipulations, offering better performance than specialized ad hoc methods.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled highly realistic image manipulations, including inpainting and region-level editing. These approaches preserve most of the original visual context and are increasingly exploited in cybersecurity-relevant threat scenarios. While numerous detectors have been proposed for identifying fully synthetic images, their ability to generalize to localized manipulations remains insufficiently characterized. This work presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors, originally trained for the deepfake detection on fully synthetic images, when applied to a distinct challenge: localized inpainting detection. The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques. Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches.

*Antonella Rech,Nicola Conci,Nicola Garau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDFoam improves mesh reconstruction in neural radiance fields by combining explicit Voronoi Diagrams with implicit Signed Distance Fields, achieving better surface quality while maintaining rendering efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and RadiantFoam struggle with precise mesh reconstruction despite advances in view synthesis and rendering speed. There's a need for better surface reconstruction while preserving photometric quality and efficiency.

Method: Jointly learns an explicit Voronoi Diagram with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing with Eikonal regularization. The SDF creates metric-consistent isosurfaces that bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set.

Result: Produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology. Substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) while maintaining comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM) and preserving training speed on par with RadiantFoam.

Conclusion: The hybrid implicit-explicit formulation (SDFoam) successfully addresses the mesh reconstruction gap in neural radiance fields, achieving better surface quality without sacrificing efficiency or photometric performance.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: First open multi-center, multi-device fetal ultrasound dataset with expert landmark annotations for all primary biometric measurements, enabling robust AI development for fetal growth assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual landmarking in fetal ultrasound is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to scanner/site variability, limiting reproducibility of automated approaches. There's a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment methods.

Method: Created an open benchmark dataset with 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects across three clinical sites using seven different US devices. Provided expert anatomical landmark annotations for head bi-parietal/occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse/antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. Included standardized subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results.

Result: Dataset enables quantification of domain shift - training/evaluation confined to single center substantially overestimates performance compared to multi-center testing. Demonstrated the importance of multi-center evaluation for realistic performance assessment.

Conclusion: First publicly available multi-center, multi-device landmark-annotated dataset covering all primary fetal biometry measures provides robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-center generalization, enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across clinical centers.

Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

Proposed Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr) - an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification using hierarchical memory banks storing frame-level details and window-level semantics, plus learnable position-aware queries initialized from memory.

Result: OMG-Bench features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6% in detection rate.

Conclusion: Established first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition and proposed HMATr framework that sets strong baseline for the field, addressing challenges of subtle motions and continuous execution in VR/AR interaction.

Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

TL;DR: TODSynth: A task-oriented data synthesis framework using Multimodal Diffusion Transformer with triple attention and control-rectify flow matching to generate stable, high-quality synthetic data for remote sensing semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current controllable generation methods for remote sensing data synthesis face challenges with semantic mask control complexity and sampling quality uncertainty, limiting their utility for downstream semantic segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes TODSynth framework with: 1) Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) using unified text-image-mask triple attention with full fine-tuning of image and mask branches; 2) Control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) that dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during early high-plasticity stages.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data, particularly effective in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios for remote sensing semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: TODSynth effectively addresses the challenges of semantic mask control and sampling quality uncertainty, bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks through task-oriented synthesis guided by semantic feedback.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

*Zhiyang Guo,Ori Zhang,Jax Xiang,Alan Zhao,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Make-It-Poseable is a feed-forward framework that reformulates 3D character posing as latent-space transformation, using a latent posing transformer to manipulate shape tokens based on skeletal motion, achieving superior posing quality and extending to 3D editing applications.


<details>

Motivation: Existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation struggle with inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability for 3D character posing.

Method: Reformulates character posing as latent-space transformation problem using a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. Includes dense pose representation for precise control, latent-space supervision strategy for high-fidelity geometry, and adaptive completion module for topological changes.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in posing quality compared to existing methods, and naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

Conclusion: Make-It-Poseable provides a novel feed-forward framework that overcomes limitations of traditional character posing methods by operating in latent space, offering improved robustness, generalizability, and enabling broader 3D editing applications.

Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

*Enis Baty,C. P. Bridges,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDet reformulates object detection using Conditional Flow Matching instead of diffusion, learning straighter transport paths that enable faster performance scaling with inference steps and better results than DiffusionDet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize DiffusionDet's generative detection formulation to broader transport problems while maintaining flexibility in box count and inference steps, addressing the curved stochastic paths of diffusion that limit performance scaling.

Method: Uses Conditional Flow Matching techniques to learn simpler, straighter transport paths in bounding box space, enabling variable number of boxes and inference steps without retraining.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-based detection (DiffusionDet) and non-generative baselines across various experiments, with gains up to +3.6% AP on COCO and +4.2% AP_rare on LVIS, especially effective in recall-constrained settings.

Conclusion: FlowDet successfully generalizes generative detection to conditional flow matching, achieving superior performance through straighter transport paths and better scaling with inference steps.

Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: Kling-Omni represents a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating, and interacting with dynamic, complex worlds beyond just content creation.

Abstract: We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R3ST is a synthetic 3D dataset that combines synthetic environments with real-world trajectories from drone footage to create realistic vehicle motion for trajectory forecasting research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets have limitations: real datasets lack precise ground-truth annotations, while synthetic datasets lack realistic vehicle motion due to AI-generated or rule-based trajectories.

Method: Create synthetic 3D environment and integrate real-world trajectories from SinD (bird's-eye-view drone footage dataset) to generate realistic synthetic trajectories.

Result: R3ST dataset bridges the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, providing accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations with authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

Conclusion: The dataset advances trajectory forecasting research by offering both synthetic data benefits (cost-effective annotation) and realistic motion patterns from real-world driving behavior.

Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

*Shuting Zhao,Zeyu Xiao,Xinrong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineST is a kinematics-guided state space model for efficient full-body motion tracking from sparse AR/VR headset signals, achieving better accuracy and temporal coherence than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-body motion tracking is crucial for AR/VR applications but challenging due to sparse signals from head-mounted displays. Existing methods have high computational costs or separate spatial/temporal modeling, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency.

Method: Proposes KineST with two core innovations: 1) kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning within the State Space Duality framework to capture intricate joint relationships with kinematic priors, and 2) mixed spatiotemporal representation learning to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts. Also introduces geometric angular velocity loss for physically meaningful rotational constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

Conclusion: KineST effectively addresses the challenges of full-body pose reconstruction from sparse AR/VR signals by integrating kinematics priors and spatiotemporal modeling, achieving better balance between accuracy, smoothness, and efficiency.

Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPredict enhances VLA models with predictive 3D geometric reasoning for better robotic manipulation in spatially demanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models are largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable for tasks requiring precise 3D reasoning and spatial awareness.

Method: Introduces two predictive modules: 1) trajectory-level module encoding motion history and predicting multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories, and 2) predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module forecasting workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future trajectories. Uses depth-based rendering for training-time supervision only.

Result: GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

Conclusion: Adding predictive 3D geometric reasoning to VLA models significantly improves their performance in manipulation tasks requiring spatial awareness, while maintaining efficient inference with only lightweight additional query tokens.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

*Marius Dähling,Sebastian Krebs,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseBEV introduces a novel two-stage anchor generation method for multi-camera 3D object detection using BEV feature cells as anchors instead of random queries, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Waymo datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BEV-based transformers use random queries as anchors, which are optimized gradually. Recent approaches use auxiliary network detections, but the authors propose a more intuitive approach using BEV feature cells directly as anchors for better efficiency and performance.

Method: 1) Uses BEV feature cells as anchors in an end-to-end approach; 2) Two-stage anchor generation specifically for multi-camera 3D detection; 3) BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression to handle scaling issues with many queries; 4) Hybrid temporal modeling integrating prior detections with temporal BEV information.

Result: Significant improvements on nuScenes dataset (NDS and mAP), especially for small objects (3.8% mAP increase for pedestrians). On Waymo Open dataset, achieves state-of-the-art LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing previous best by 5.4%. Works well even with sparser BEV grids.

Conclusion: DenseBEV provides an efficient and effective approach for multi-camera 3D object detection by using BEV feature cells as anchors, with strong performance improvements and particular effectiveness for small object detection.

Abstract: In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA radiology report generation systems (MAIRA-2, MedPaLM-M) require extensive multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most clinical settings.

Method: Combines frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer encoder with GPT-2 decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention using lung/heart segmentation masks with hierarchical Gaussian smoothing to bias attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters.

Result: Achieved substantial gains on MIMIC-CXR: CheXpert Macro-F1 for 5 key pathologies increased 168% (0.083→0.238), Micro-F1 146% (0.137→0.337), broader 14 observations improved 86% (0.170→0.316), and RadGraph F1 rose 9.7% for structural coherence.

Conclusion: Decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and coherence in clinically relevant regions, demonstrating effective radiology report generation with compact, purely image-conditioned design accessible to resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is a promising application of multimodal deep learning, aiming to reduce reporting workload and improve consistency. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

Motivation: T2I model evaluation faces benchmark drift problems where static benchmarks fail to keep up with evolving model capabilities, causing misalignment with human judgment over time.

Method: Analyzed GenEval benchmark drift, conducted large-scale human study, then created GenEval 2 with improved visual concept coverage and higher compositionality, plus Soft-TIFA evaluation method combining primitive visual concept judgments.

Result: GenEval has drifted significantly (up to 17.7% absolute error from human judgment) and been saturated for some time. GenEval 2 is more challenging for current models, and Soft-TIFA shows better alignment with human judgment.

Conclusion: Benchmark drift is a serious issue in T2I evaluation. GenEval 2 and Soft-TIFA provide improved benchmarks and evaluation methods, but continual audits and improvements are essential to maintain human-aligned evaluation over time.

Abstract: Automating Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation is challenging; a judge model must be used to score correctness, and test prompts must be selected to be challenging for current T2I models but not the judge. We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.

### [122] [RePlan: Reasoning-guided Region Planning for Complex Instruction-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16864)
*Tianyuan Qu,Lei Ke,Xiaohang Zhan,Longxiang Tang,Yuqi Liu,Bohao Peng,Bei Yu,Dong Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RePlan is a plan-then-execute framework for complex instruction-based image editing that uses a vision-language planner to decompose instructions and ground them to specific regions, then applies parallel multi-region edits via attention-region injection without iterative inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing models struggle with Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes, leading to poor performance in fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits.

Method: RePlan couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and grounds them to target regions. The editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. GRPO-based reinforcement learning is applied to the planner using 1K instruction-only examples to improve reasoning fidelity.

Result: RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets across IV-Complex settings, improving regional precision and overall fidelity. The authors also introduce IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits.

Conclusion: RePlan effectively addresses IV-Complexity in instruction-based image editing through its plan-then-execute framework with explicit region grounding and parallel editing capabilities, demonstrating superior performance even compared to models trained on much larger datasets.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

### [123] [Pixel Seal: Adversarial-only training for invisible image and video watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16874)
*Tomáš Souček,Pierre Fernandez,Hady Elsahar,Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi,Valeriu Lacatusu,Tuan Tran,Tom Sander,Alexandre Mourachko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel Seal introduces a new SOTA watermarking method that addresses key limitations of existing approaches through adversarial-only training, three-stage optimization, and high-resolution adaptation for both images and videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods struggle to balance robustness and true imperceptibility, relying on flawed perceptual losses, suffering from optimization instability, and failing to scale effectively to high-resolution images and videos.

Method: 1) Adversarial-only training paradigm eliminating unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses; 2) Three-stage training schedule decoupling robustness and imperceptibility for stable convergence; 3) High-resolution adaptation using JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation; 4) Temporal watermark pooling for video adaptation.

Result: Pixel Seal achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and imperceptibility across various image types and transformations, and efficiently adapts to video applications.

Conclusion: Pixel Seal provides a practical and scalable solution for reliable digital provenance in real-world image and video settings, addressing fundamental limitations of existing watermarking approaches.

Abstract: Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.

### [124] [Memory-Enhanced SAM3 for Occlusion-Robust Surgical Instrument Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16880)
*Valay Bundele,Mehran Hosseinzadeh,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMeDI-SAM3 enhances SAM3 for surgical instrument segmentation with memory filtering, interpolation, and re-identification to handle occlusions and motion in endoscopic videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos faces challenges from occlusions, rapid motion, specular artifacts, and instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a spatio-temporal framework, it has limitations in surgical scenes including indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions.

Method: Three training-free components: (1) relevance-aware memory filtering with occlusion-aware memory for pre-occlusion frames, (2) piecewise interpolation to expand effective memory capacity, and (3) feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for post-occlusion identity disambiguation.

Result: Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of ~7% and ~16% respectively over vanilla SAM3, outperforming prior training-based approaches.

Conclusion: ReMeDI-SAM3 effectively addresses SAM3's limitations for surgical scenes through memory enhancement, mitigating error accumulation and enabling reliable recovery after occlusions without requiring training.

Abstract: Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

*Norika Wada,Kohei Yamashita,Ryo Kawahara,Ko Nishino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PhyGs estimates material composition and mechanical parameters of complex multi-material objects (like flowers) from videos, using novel 3D/2D losses and temporal mini-batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world objects often have complex material compositions and geometries that existing methods can't handle, as they assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Flowers serve as a representative example of such complex natural objects.

Method: Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) jointly segments objects into similar materials and recovers continuum mechanical parameters from short videos. Uses cascaded 3D and 2D losses and temporal mini-batching for efficiency.

Result: Experimental results on the Phlowers dataset (people interacting with flowers) demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components for multi-material physical parameter estimation.

Conclusion: M-PhyGs successfully addresses the challenging task of estimating physical material parameters for complex multi-material objects from visual data, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge of the physical material properties governing the dynamics of a real-world object becomes necessary to accurately anticipate its response to unseen interactions. Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.

### [126] [LinkedOut: Linking World Knowledge Representation Out of Video LLM for Next-Generation Video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16891)
*Haichao Zhang,Yao Lu,Lichen Wang,Yunzhe Li,Daiwei Chen,Yunpeng Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinkedOut extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video frames to enable fast, multi-video recommendation without language bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLLMs have limitations for real-world video recommendation: high latency from decode-only generation, lack of multi-video input support, and loss of fine-grained visual details due to language-only outputs.

Method: LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs with promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. Uses cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE to select appropriate abstraction levels from VLLM features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for video recommendation without handcrafted labels. First VLLM-based video recommendation method operating on raw frames.

Conclusion: LinkedOut provides a practical path to leverage VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks like recommendation, with benefits confirmed through interpretability studies and ablations.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

*Kaiwen Jiang,Xueting Li,Seonwook Park,Ravi Ramamoorthi,Shalini De Mello,Koki Nagano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Instant4D: A method that distills 2D diffusion knowledge into a feed-forward encoder to create 3D-consistent, fast, and expressive animatable portraits from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D portrait animation methods lack 3D consistency and speed, while 3D-aware methods sacrifice expression details. There's a need to combine the strengths of both approaches for real-world applications like digital twins and telepresence.

Method: Distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models into a feed-forward encoder that converts single images into 3D-consistent animatable representations. Uses decoupled animation representation that learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating dependency on parametric models. Employs efficient lightweight local fusion strategy instead of computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms.

Result: Achieves 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while maintaining comparable animation quality to state-of-the-art methods. Successfully balances speed and quality without trading one for the other.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines the strengths of 2D diffusion models (expression details) and 3D-aware methods (consistency and speed), creating a practical solution for real-time portrait animation applications.

Abstract: Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

### [128] [FlashPortrait: 6x Faster Infinite Portrait Animation with Adaptive Latent Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16900)
*Shuyuan Tu,Yueming Pan,Yinming Huang,Xintong Han,Zhen Xing,Qi Dai,Kai Qiu,Chong Luo,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashPortrait is a video diffusion transformer that generates ID-consistent long portrait animations with 6x faster inference using dynamic sliding windows and higher-order latent derivative prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods for long-portrait animation fail to maintain identity consistency while being computationally slow. There's a need for an approach that preserves identity across long sequences while accelerating inference.

Method: Uses identity-agnostic facial expression features with a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align features with diffusion latents. Employs dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending for smooth transitions. Accelerates inference by predicting future timestep latents using higher-order latent derivatives based on variation rates and derivative magnitude ratios.

Result: Achieves up to 6x acceleration in inference speed while maintaining identity consistency in long portrait animations. Experiments show effectiveness both qualitatively and quantitatively on benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlashPortrait successfully addresses identity consistency and speed limitations in long-portrait animation generation, offering an efficient end-to-end solution for ID-preserving infinite-length video synthesis.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### [129] [Alchemist: Unlocking Efficiency in Text-to-Image Model Training via Meta-Gradient Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16905)
*Kaixin Ding,Yang Zhou,Xi Chen,Miao Yang,Jiarong Ou,Rui Chen,Xin Tao,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Alchemist is a meta-gradient-based framework that automatically selects high-quality text-image pairs for T2I model training, improving data efficiency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models are limited by low-quality training data from web-crawled and synthetic sources, which degrade visual fidelity and training efficiency. Existing data selection methods rely on manual curation or heuristic scoring, lacking automated solutions for image modalities.

Method: Alchemist uses meta-gradient learning to assess sample influence through two stages: 1) training a lightweight rater with multi-granularity perception to estimate sample influence using gradient information, and 2) applying Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets.

Result: Experiments show Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on just 50% of data selected by Alchemist can outperform training on the full dataset.

Conclusion: Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for T2I training, effectively addressing data quality issues and improving training efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

TL;DR: VIVA is a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that uses VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization to handle diverse real-world editing instructions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video editing methods are limited by training on simple editing operations, which prevents them from generalizing to complex, real-world editing instructions.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) VLM-based instructor encodes textual instructions, source video frames, and reference images into visually-grounded representations; 2) Edit-GRPO post-training stage adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization for video editing with relative rewards. Plus a synthetic data pipeline for diverse training data.

Result: VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VIVA addresses the generalization gap in instruction-based video editing through VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization, enabling handling of diverse real-world editing instructions with high fidelity.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing aims to modify an input video according to a natural-language instruction while preserving content fidelity and temporal coherence. However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods. Website: https://viva-paper.github.io

Abstract: Prior works on 3D hand trajectory prediction are constrained by datasets that decouple motion from semantic supervision and by models that weakly link reasoning and action. To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting object changes (added, removed, or moved) between scene captures is important for applications like robotic tidying and construction monitoring, but varying viewpoints can cause false positives.

Method: A training-free approach that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to align captures in 3D, extract object regions, and compare spatial and semantic features to detect changes.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements) on multi-view and two-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: SceneDiff provides an effective solution for multiview object change detection and introduces the first multiview change detection benchmark with object instance annotations, which will be publicly released.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying objects that have been added, removed, or moved between a pair of captures (images or videos) of the same scene at different times. Detecting such changes is important for many applications, such as robotic tidying or construction progress and safety monitoring. A major challenge is that varying viewpoints can cause objects to falsely appear changed. We introduce SceneDiff Benchmark, the first multiview change detection benchmark with object instance annotations, comprising 350 diverse video pairs with thousands of changed objects. We also introduce the SceneDiff method, a new training-free approach for multiview object change detection that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to robustly predict across multiple benchmarks. Our method aligns the captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and compares spatial and semantic region features to detect changes. Experiments on multi-view and two-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements). The benchmark and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: MomaGraph: Unified scene representation for mobile manipulators integrating spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements, with dataset, benchmark, and 7B vision-language model achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulators in households need compact, semantically rich scene representations that capture object locations, functions, and actionable parts. Current scene graph approaches separate spatial/functional relations, treat scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlook task-relevant information.

Method: Introduces MomaGraph unified scene representation, creates MomaGraph-Scenes dataset (large-scale annotated task-driven scene graphs), develops MomaGraph-Bench evaluation suite (6 reasoning capabilities), and trains MomaGraph-R1 (7B vision-language model with reinforcement learning) using Graph-then-Plan framework.

Result: MomaGraph-R1 achieves 71.6% accuracy on benchmark (+11.4% over best baseline), demonstrates state-of-the-art results among open-source models, generalizes across public benchmarks, and transfers effectively to real-robot experiments.

Conclusion: MomaGraph provides a comprehensive solution for embodied agents with unified scene representation, dataset, benchmark, and model that advances household mobile manipulation capabilities through integrated spatial-functional understanding and task-oriented reasoning.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.

Motivation: Discrete tokenizers lag behind continuous ones in multimodal systems despite their natural alignment with autoregressive paradigms, limiting their adoption in high-resolution image generation.

Result: Achieves SOTA reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) with only 64 tokens per image and exceptional class-to-image generation (gFID = 2.29).

Conclusion: SFTok demonstrates that discrete tokenizers can achieve competitive performance with continuous ones through proper architectural design and training strategies, enabling efficient multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).

TL;DR: A panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances using a data-in-the-loop paradigm with large-scale dataset collection and three-stage pseudo-label curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust panoramic depth estimation model that works across different scene distances (indoor/outdoor) and data sources (synthetic/real), addressing domain gaps and generalization challenges in panoramic depth estimation.

Method: 1) Data collection combining public datasets, UE5 synthetic data, text-to-image models, and web panoramic images. 2) Three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth. 3) DINOv3-Large backbone with plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization for distance robustness and geometric consistency.

Result: Strong performance on multiple benchmarks (Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, Deep360) with robust zero-shot generalization and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed panoramic metric depth foundation model effectively generalizes across diverse scene distances through comprehensive data curation and specialized optimization techniques, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we present a panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances. We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

TL;DR: UniStereo dataset and StereoPilot model for efficient monocular-to-stereo video conversion without depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High demand for stereo video content due to growth of VR/3D displays, but current production is costly and existing conversion methods suffer from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations.

Method: Created UniStereo (first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion covering both formats), then proposed StereoPilot - an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes target view without explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling, equipped with learnable domain switcher and cycle consistency loss.

Result: StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency, adapting seamlessly to different stereo formats with improved consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses limitations of traditional DWI pipeline through unified dataset and efficient direct synthesis model, enabling high-quality stereo video conversion for practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of stereoscopic displays, including VR headsets and 3D cinemas, has led to increasing demand for high-quality stereo video content. However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: AdaTooler-V is a multimodal LLM that adaptively decides when to use vision tools, avoiding unnecessary tool invocations that degrade performance and increase overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs often exhibit "blind tool-use reasoning" - invoking vision tools even when unnecessary, which increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. There's a need for adaptive tool-use that determines when tools are genuinely beneficial.

Method: 1) AT-GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging tool use only when beneficial. 2) Constructed two datasets: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data.

Result: Experiments across twelve benchmarks show strong reasoning capability, outperforming existing methods. AdaTooler-V-7B achieves 89.8% accuracy on V* benchmark, surpassing commercial models GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

Conclusion: AdaTooler-V demonstrates effective adaptive tool-use in MLLMs, reducing unnecessary tool invocations while maintaining strong performance. The approach with AT-GRPO and specialized datasets enables smarter tool utilization, making MLLMs more efficient and effective.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

TL;DR: DVGT is a driving-targeted dense 3D geometry perception model that reconstructs global dense 3D point maps from unposed multi-view visual inputs without relying on precise camera parameters or explicit 3D geometric priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of driving-targeted dense geometry perception models that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. Current methods rely on precise camera parameters and explicit 3D geometric priors, limiting their flexibility.

Method: Uses DINO backbone for visual feature extraction, then employs alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations. Multiple heads decode global point maps in ego coordinates and ego poses for each frame.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios, trained on large mixture of driving datasets (nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, DDAD). Directly predicts metric-scaled geometry without post-alignment with external sensors.

Conclusion: DVGT provides a flexible, camera-agnostic solution for dense 3D geometry perception in autonomous driving that eliminates dependency on precise camera parameters and explicit 3D priors, enabling adaptation to arbitrary camera configurations.

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video editing remains less explored compared to image editing, facing challenges in maintaining temporal consistency, providing flexible control, and generalizing across different editing scenarios. The authors aim to create a comprehensive framework that addresses these limitations.

Method: Three-pronged approach: 1) Data: compose existing experts with fast inverses, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision, mine dense-captioned clips, and add transition supervision. 2) Model: leverage pretrained text-to-video models' inherent editing capability with simple sequence concatenation conditioning and light LoRA fine-tuning. 3) Control: unify spatiotemporal control via single mask mechanism and support optional reference images.

Result: EasyV2V achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing both concurrent research systems and commercial systems. It supports flexible input combinations including video+text, video+mask+text, and video+mask+reference+text.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that a simplified design with careful consideration of data, architecture, and control can effectively address video editing challenges, providing a strong foundation for instruction-based video editing with flexible control mechanisms.

Abstract: While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

TL;DR: AuditDM is an automated framework that discovers and fixes MLLM failure modes by training an auditor model to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM evaluation methods lack interpretability and fail to fully reveal significant capability gaps between models, limiting effective model diagnosis and improvement.

Method: Fine-tune an MLLM as an auditor using reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models, creating interpretable failure exemplars.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovered over 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries improved all models across 16 benchmarks, enabling a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart.

Conclusion: As data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path for model diagnosis and improvement, with AuditDM providing an automated framework to discover and rectify MLLM failure modes.

Abstract: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

TL;DR: NEPA (Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression) is a self-supervised visual learning method that trains models to predict future patch embeddings instead of reconstructing pixels or using contrastive losses, achieving strong performance on ImageNet and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by successful generative pretraining in NLP, the authors explore whether similar principles can work for visual self-supervised learning. They propose shifting from learning representations to learning models that can perform predictive tasks directly.

Method: NEPA trains models to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones using causal masking and stop gradient. It's a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as the sole objective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads.

Result: Achieves 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transfers effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. The method retains architectural simplicity and scalability.

Conclusion: Generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning, bridging the gap between NLP-style generative pretraining and visual representation learning.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: Generative Refocusing: A two-step method using DeblurNet and BokehNet for single-image refocusing with semi-supervised training combining synthetic and real data for realistic bokeh effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography but difficult to achieve with single-image refocusing. Current methods have limitations: requiring all-in-focus inputs, relying on synthetic data from simulators, and having limited control over aperture settings.

Method: Two-step process: 1) DeblurNet recovers all-in-focus images from various inputs, 2) BokehNet creates controllable bokeh effects. Uses semi-supervised training combining synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, leveraging EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond simulator capabilities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Enables text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes for enhanced creative control.

Conclusion: Generative Refocusing provides an effective solution for single-image refocusing with realistic bokeh effects, overcoming limitations of previous methods through semi-supervised training that bridges synthetic and real data domains.

Abstract: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

TL;DR: WorldCanvas is a multimodal framework for generating controllable world events by combining text prompts, motion trajectories, and reference images to create coherent videos with multi-agent interactions and object persistence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches have limitations: text-only methods lack visual control, and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods are insufficient for complex world events. There's a need for a framework that enables rich, user-directed simulation with better control over motion, timing, object identity, and multi-agent interactions.

Method: WorldCanvas combines three modalities: 1) trajectories encoding motion, timing, and visibility; 2) natural language for semantic intent; and 3) reference images for visual grounding of object identity. This multimodal approach enables generation of coherent events including multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance, and counterintuitive events.

Result: The framework generates videos with both temporal coherence and emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene structure even when objects temporarily disappear. It successfully handles complex world events that existing methods struggle with.

Conclusion: WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators by supporting expressive world events generation through multimodal control, enabling richer and more controllable simulation capabilities.

Abstract: We present WorldCanvas, a framework for promptable world events that enables rich, user-directed simulation by combining text, trajectories, and reference images. Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance.

TL;DR: Value Lens is a two-stage LLM-based model that detects human values in text, first generating a formal theory of values and then identifying values in text using dual LLMs (detector + critic).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous systems make more decisions, they need to ensure their choices align with human values. Systems must assess whether their actions promote or undermine human values, requiring effective value detection methods.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) LLM generates formal theory of values verified by experts, 2) Pair of LLMs work together - one detects values in text, the other acts as critic/reviewer of the detection process.

Result: Value Lens performs comparably to, and even exceeds, the effectiveness of other models using different methods for similar value detection tasks.

Conclusion: Value Lens provides an effective generative AI approach for detecting human values in text, addressing the critical need for autonomous systems to align with human values through improved value detection capabilities.

Abstract: The autonomous decision-making process, which is increasingly applied to computer systems, requires that the choices made by these systems align with human values. In this context, systems must assess how well their decisions reflect human values. To achieve this, it is essential to identify whether each available action promotes or undermines these values. This article presents Value Lens, a text-based model designed to detect human values using generative artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed model operates in two stages: the first aims to formulate a formal theory of values, while the second focuses on identifying these values within a given text. In the first stage, an LLM generates a description based on the established theory of values, which experts then verify. In the second stage, a pair of LLMs is employed: one LLM detects the presence of values, and the second acts as a critic and reviewer of the detection process. The results indicate that Value Lens performs comparably to, and even exceeds, the effectiveness of other models that apply different methods for similar tasks.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Researchers developed a methodology to evaluate AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) for language models, applying four selected tools to Portuguese language models and interviewing developers to assess their effectiveness in identifying ethical considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models become more prevalent in AI, there's a growing need for responsible development and deployment. While many AI Ethics Tools have been published to help address ethical concerns, they often lack proper documentation, use examples, and evidence of practical effectiveness.

Method: Conducted extensive literature survey of 213 AIETs, selected four tools (Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, Harms Modeling) based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Applied these tools to Portuguese language models and conducted 35 hours of interviews with developers to evaluate the tools' usefulness and quality in identifying ethical considerations.

Result: The AIETs served as a general guide for formulating ethical considerations about language models, but they failed to address unique aspects like idiomatic expressions and didn't help identify potential negative impacts specific to Portuguese language models.

Conclusion: Current AI Ethics Tools provide a basic framework for ethical considerations but have significant limitations in addressing language-specific issues and identifying unique negative impacts of language models, particularly for non-English languages like Portuguese.

Abstract: In Artificial Intelligence (AI), language models have gained significant importance due to the widespread adoption of systems capable of simulating realistic conversations with humans through text generation. Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model. The results suggest that the applied AIETs serve as a guide for formulating general ethical considerations about language models. However, we note that they do not address unique aspects of these models, such as idiomatic expressions. Additionally, these AIETs did not help to identify potential negative impacts of models for the Portuguese language.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become essential for information access and decision support, ensuring their fairness across diverse contexts is crucial for safe and responsible deployment.

Method: Comprehensive examination of four widely adopted LLMs using carefully designed experiments: political neutrality via news summarization, ideological biases via news stance classification, geopolitical alliance tendencies via UN voting patterns, language bias via multilingual story completion, and gender affinities via World Values Survey responses.

Result: Results indicate that while LLMs are aligned to be neutral and impartial, they still exhibit various types of biases and affinities across all tested dimensions.

Conclusion: Despite alignment efforts, LLMs continue to show persistent biases, highlighting the need for ongoing fairness evaluation and mitigation strategies in their development and deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become indispensable tools for acquiring information and supporting human decision-making. However, ensuring that these models uphold fairness across varied contexts is critical to their safe and responsible deployment. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive examination of four widely adopted LLMs, probing their underlying biases and inclinations across the dimensions of politics, ideology, alliance, language, and gender. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we investigate their political neutrality using news summarization, ideological biases through news stance classification, tendencies toward specific geopolitical alliances via United Nations voting patterns, language bias in the context of multilingual story completion, and gender-related affinities as revealed by responses to the World Values Survey. Results indicate that while the LLMs are aligned to be neutral and impartial, they still show biases and affinities of different types.

*Yuxi Sun,Wei Gao,Hongzhan Lin,Jing Ma,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: ClarityEthic improves AI ethical assessment by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions to enhance valence prediction and provide explainable moral reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems assess human actions using data-driven approaches without explicit social norms, making them difficult to explain and untrustworthy. Human assessors consider social norms when evaluating actions, and conflicting norms create tension that influences behavior.

Method: Introduces ClarityEthic approach that generates conflicting social norms behind human actions using a contrastive learning strategy to strengthen language models' moral reasoning capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms strong baseline approaches. Human evaluations confirm that generated social norms provide plausible explanations for behavioral assessments.

Conclusion: Emulating human ethical assessment by considering conflicting social norms enhances AI's valence prediction and provides explainable moral reasoning, making AI systems more trustworthy.

Abstract: Human behaviors are often guided or constrained by social norms, which are defined as shared, commonsense rules. For example, underlying an action ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ``\textit{It is expected to be brave to report crimes}''. Current AI systems that assess valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human actions by leveraging large-scale data training not grounded on explicit norms may be difficult to explain, and thus untrustworthy. Emulating human assessors by considering social norms can help AI models better understand and predict valence. While multiple norms come into play, conflicting norms can create tension and directly influence human behavior. For example, when deciding whether to ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}'', one may balance \textit{bravery} against \textit{self-protection}. In this paper, we introduce \textit{ClarityEthic}, a novel ethical assessment approach, to enhance valence prediction and explanation by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions, which strengthens the moral reasoning capabilities of language models by using a contrastive learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline approaches, and human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations for the assessment of human behaviors.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multilingual bias evaluation framework combining explicit (BBQ benchmark) and implicit (prompt-based IAT) bias assessment across five languages, revealing significant cross-lingual bias variations in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for comprehensive cross-lingual bias analysis in LLMs, as current methods may miss implicit biases and lack systematic comparison across languages, hindering development of equitable multilingual models.

Method: Combines explicit bias assessment using BBQ benchmark with implicit bias measurement via prompt-based Implicit Association Test, translating prompts and word lists into five languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, French, Spanish) for direct cross-lingual comparison.

Result: Substantial bias gaps across languages: Arabic and Spanish show higher stereotype bias, Chinese and English show lower bias. Age exhibits lowest explicit but highest implicit bias, highlighting importance of detecting implicit biases missed by standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs vary significantly across languages and bias dimensions. The study fills a key research gap by providing comprehensive methodology for cross-lingual bias analysis, establishing foundation for developing equitable multilingual LLMs that ensure fairness across diverse languages and cultures.

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative multilingual bias evaluation framework for assessing bias in Large Language Models, combining explicit bias assessment through the BBQ benchmark with implicit bias measurement using a prompt-based Implicit Association Test. By translating the prompts and word list into five target languages, English, Chinese, Arabic, French, and Spanish, we directly compare different types of bias across languages. The results reveal substantial gaps in bias across languages used in LLMs. For example, Arabic and Spanish consistently show higher levels of stereotype bias, while Chinese and English exhibit lower levels of bias. We also identify contrasting patterns across bias types. Age shows the lowest explicit bias but the highest implicit bias, emphasizing the importance of detecting implicit biases that are undetectable with standard benchmarks. These findings indicate that LLMs vary significantly across languages and bias dimensions. This study fills a key research gap by providing a comprehensive methodology for cross-lingual bias analysis. Ultimately, our work establishes a foundation for the development of equitable multilingual LLMs, ensuring fairness and effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures.

TL;DR: LLaDA2.0 converts auto-regressive LLMs into discrete diffusion models through a 3-phase training scheme, creating 16B and 100B MoE models with parallel decoding advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment by converting pre-trained AR models into discrete diffusion LLMs instead of costly training from scratch, enabling knowledge inheritance and efficiency.

Method: Uses a 3-phase block-level WSD training scheme: progressive block-size increase (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable), and reverting to compact block diffusion (decay). Post-training alignment with SFT and DPO creates MoE variants.

Result: Created LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B) instruction-tuned MoE variants that deliver superior performance and efficiency at frontier scale with parallel decoding advantages. Both models were open-sourced.

Conclusion: LLaDA2.0 establishes a new paradigm for converting AR models to discrete diffusion LLMs, enabling efficient frontier-scale deployment with preserved knowledge and parallel decoding benefits.

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

### [150] [D3G: Diverse Demographic Data Generation Increases Zero-Shot Image Classification Accuracy within Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15747)
*Javon Hickmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D3G is a training-free, zero-shot method that uses Stable Diffusion XL to generate diverse demographic data at inference time to improve CLIP's classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models like CLIP still struggle with fine-grained image classification and demographic bias, especially when datasets lack balanced demographics, leading to harmful bias in zero-shot classification.

Method: Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G) uses CLIP as base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as generative model to create diverse demographic data at inference time without additional training.

Result: Providing diverse demographic data at inference improves classification accuracy and reduces demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models, with exploration of individual demographic impacts on accuracy.

Conclusion: D3G effectively addresses demographic bias in zero-shot image classification by generating diverse demographic representations at inference, improving both accuracy and fairness without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSO uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, enabling inference-time control over bias-performance trade-offs in VLMs and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs and LLMs exhibit demographic biases in decision-making (e.g., failing to identify women as doctors), and users need controllable bias reduction during inference, especially when bias mitigation causes performance loss.

Method: Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) - reinforcement learning approach to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance.

Result: DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, offering practitioners inference-time control over the bias-performance trade-off.

Conclusion: Directly optimized steering strategies are more effective for bias intervention than methods relying on pre-defined heuristics, highlighting the benefit of designing steering methods specifically for controlling model behavior.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

*Caner Erden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DR-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes low-rank factorization of attention in LLMs, adapting rank selection to input context and hardware constraints while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional low-rank approximations use static rank assumptions, limiting flexibility across diverse input contexts. There's a need for adaptive rank selection that balances attention fidelity with computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses RL agent for sequential rank selection policy optimization, integrates online matrix perturbation theory for incremental rank updates, employs lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched SVD operations for GPU scalability.

Result: Maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing FLOPs, especially effective in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096).

Conclusion: Bridges gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering principled alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques for resource-constrained deep learning.

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formulates LDA topic number selection as a discrete black-box optimization problem and compares evolutionary methods (GA, ES) with amortized approaches (PABBO, SABBO), finding amortized methods are much more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Choosing the optimal number of topics T in LDA is crucial for both statistical fit and interpretability, but current methods for selecting T are inefficient and computationally expensive.

Method: Formulate T selection as discrete black-box optimization where each evaluation trains an LDA model and measures validation perplexity. Compare four optimizers under fixed budget: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolution Strategy (ES), Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO), and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO).

Result: While all methods eventually reach similar final perplexity bands, amortized optimizers (PABBO, SABBO) are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically finds near-optimal T after essentially one evaluation, PABBO finds competitive configurations within few evaluations, while GA and ES require almost the full budget.

Conclusion: Amortized black-box optimization methods like PABBO and SABBO offer dramatically improved efficiency for LDA topic number selection compared to traditional evolutionary approaches, making them practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

TL;DR: DataFlow is a unified LLM-driven data preparation framework with system-level abstractions, reusable operators, and natural language pipeline generation via DataFlow-Agent, improving downstream LLM performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data preparation for LLMs relies on ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows that lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation, creating a need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines.

Method: DataFlow provides system-level abstractions for modular, reusable, and composable data transformations with a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API. It includes nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines. DataFlow-Agent automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification.

Result: DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance across six use cases: math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1-3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. A unified 10K-sample dataset enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data.

Conclusion: DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, establishing a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

### [155] [Impacts of Racial Bias in Historical Training Data for News AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16901)
*Rahul Bhargava,Malene Hornstrup Jespersen,Emily Boardman Ndulue,Vivica Dsouza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers investigate racial bias in an AI classifier trained on NY Times corpus, finding the "blacks" label acts as a flawed racism detector with poor performance on modern racial issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models trained on historical data encode outdated stereotypes, posing risks for newsroom applications. The study examines racial bias in a classifier trained on NY Times corpus to understand how historical biases affect modern AI tools.

Method: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the "blacks" label in training corpus, combined with explainable AI methods to understand what concepts the label encodes in the classifier.

Result: The "blacks" label partially functions as a general "racism detector" across minoritized groups but performs poorly on modern examples like COVID-19 anti-Asian hate stories and Black Lives Matter reporting.

Conclusion: Newsrooms face a fundamental tension: adopting AI workflow tools while reducing reproduction of historical biases. Interrogating embedded biases is crucial for responsible AI implementation in journalism.

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

*Peter Chen,Xiaopeng Li,Ziniu Li,Wotao Yin,Xi Chen,Tianyi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLM reasoning through paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards suppress exploitation while entropy minimization suppresses exploration, yet both improve performance. The paper investigates how policy entropy relates to performance and whether spurious rewards work via clipping bias and model contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards (suppressing exploitation) and entropy minimization (suppressing exploration). Both improve reasoning performance, but the underlying principles reconciling these effects remain poorly understood.

Method: The paper focuses on two fundamental questions: (1) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (2) whether spurious rewards yield gains through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. The authors propose a reward-misalignment model to explain why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings.

Result: Results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs. However, entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. The reward-misalignment model explains why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings.

Conclusion: The findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training, reconciling the paradoxical effects of suppressing both exploitation and exploration in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

### [157] [Surely Large Multimodal Models (Don't) Excel in Visual Species Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15748)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LMMs underperform FSL expert models in Visual Species Recognition, but can effectively correct expert model mistakes via post-hoc prompting, leading to a simple plug-and-play POC method that boosts FSL accuracy by +6.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VSR requires expert annotation which is scarce, making few-shot learning necessary. While LMMs excel at general recognition, their performance on specialized VSR tasks compared to FSL expert models is unknown.

Method: POC (Post-hoc Correction) prompts LMMs to re-rank FSL expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples, without extra training or validation.

Result: POC outperforms prior FSL methods by +6.4% accuracy across five VSR benchmarks, generalizes to different backbones and LMMs, and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement module.

Conclusion: LMMs struggle with direct VSR but excel at correcting expert model mistakes, enabling a simple post-hoc correction method that significantly boosts few-shot learning performance without additional training.

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control, creating a need for principled methods to bridge mechanistic interpretability with actionable model editing.

Method: Uses ℓ₁-regularized autoencoder to learn sparse feature basis without supervision, validates features with Grad-FAM saliency mapping, performs weight-space interventions via autoencoder structure, and derives critical suppression threshold α_crit for robustness diagnostics.

Result: Validated on ResNet-18 and ViT-B/16 models, demonstrating consistent interpretable control over model behavior, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features.

Conclusion: Provides a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing transparent and controllable AI systems through a unified discover-validate-control framework.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

TL;DR: Machine unlearning introduces privacy risks for retained data in dual-view settings where adversaries can query both original and unlearned models, enabling more effective membership inference attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While machine unlearning addresses data deletion requests, prior work focused on privacy of unlearned data, leaving retained data vulnerabilities unexplored. The paper aims to investigate privacy risks to retained data in dual-view settings where adversaries can access both original and unlearned models.

Method: Introduces privacy knowledge gain concept from information theory to show dual-view setting amplifies privacy leakage. Proposes DVIA (Dual-View Inference Attack) that extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models without training an attack model, employing lightweight likelihood ratio inference.

Result: Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate DVIA's effectiveness and highlight significant privacy risks in dual-view settings, demonstrating that adversaries gain more information than querying either model alone.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning introduces new privacy vulnerabilities for retained data in dual-view settings, necessitating consideration of these risks when implementing unlearning mechanisms to protect both unlearned and retained data privacy.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

TL;DR: Federated Learning enables collaborative ML for rare disease diagnosis using decentralized collagen VI microscopy images, achieving better performance than single-institution models while preserving patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML diagnosis of rare diseases like collagen VI-related dystrophies is limited by data scarcity and fragmentation across institutions. Privacy regulations and logistical barriers prevent data sharing, creating a need for privacy-preserving collaborative approaches.

Method: Used Federated Learning with Sherpa.ai FL platform to train ML models across distributed datasets from two international organizations. Applied FL to collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures to classify three pathogenic mechanism groups.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.82 for classifying collagen VI images into three pathogenic groups (exon skipping, glycine substitution, pseudoexon insertion), outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). FL improved diagnostic utility and generalizability.

Conclusion: Federated Learning enables effective collaborative ML for rare disease diagnosis while maintaining data privacy. This approach not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also supports variant interpretation and sequencing strategy prioritization for novel pathogenic variants.

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.

*Stefan Dvoretskii,Anwai Archit,Constantin Pape,Josh Moore,Marco Nolden*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BioimageAIpub is a workflow that simplifies bioimaging data conversion and enables seamless upload to HuggingFace for easier sharing and consumption by ML tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bioimage analysis requires large datasets, but existing repositories like IDR and BioImage Archive require substantial data wrangling before use with analysis tools, creating time-consuming barriers for researchers.

Method: Introduces BioimageAIpub workflow that streamlines bioimaging data conversion and enables direct upload to HuggingFace platform.

Result: Enables seamless sharing of bioimaging datasets on HuggingFace, reducing data wrangling time and making datasets more accessible for machine learning tools.

Conclusion: BioimageAIpub addresses the data accessibility bottleneck in bioimage analysis by providing a streamlined workflow for converting and sharing bioimaging datasets on popular ML platforms.

Abstract: Modern bioimage analysis approaches are data hungry, making it necessary for researchers to scavenge data beyond those collected within their (bio)imaging facilities. In addition to scale, bioimaging datasets must be accompanied with suitable, high-quality annotations and metadata. Although established data repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR) and BioImage Archive offer rich metadata, their contents typically cannot be directly consumed by image analysis tools without substantial data wrangling. Such a tedious assembly and conversion of (meta)data can account for a dedicated amount of time investment for researchers, hindering the development of more powerful analysis tools. Here, we introduce BioimageAIpub, a workflow that streamlines bioimaging data conversion, enabling a seamless upload to HuggingFace, a widely used platform for sharing machine learning datasets and models.

TL;DR: A framework for comparing AI segmentation models without ground truth, using standardized representations and visualization tools to evaluate 6 models on 31 anatomical structures in CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With many similar AI segmentation models available, there's a need to evaluate them on datasets lacking ground truth annotations to enable informed model selection.

Method: Harmonize segmentation results into standard interoperable representation with consistent terminology-based labeling. Extend 3D Slicer for loading/comparison, and create interactive summary plots and OHIF Viewer visualizations. Apply framework to evaluate 6 open-source models on 31 structures in NLST CT scans.

Result: Framework enables automated loading, structure-wise inspection, and model comparison. Shows excellent agreement for some structures (lungs) but not others (some models produce invalid vertebrae/rib segmentations). Allows quick detection of problematic results.

Conclusion: Provides practical resources (harmonization scripts, plots, visualization tools) to assist model evaluation without ground truth, ultimately enabling informed model selection for anatomy segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Purpose AI-based methods for anatomy segmentation can help automate characterization of large imaging datasets. The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results. The comparison shows excellent agreement segmenting some (e.g., lung) but not all structures (e.g., some models produce invalid vertebrae or rib segmentations). Conclusions The resources developed are linked from https://imagingdatacommons.github.io/segmentation-comparison/ including segmentation harmonization scripts, summary plots, and visualization tools. This work assists in model evaluation in absence of ground truth, ultimately enabling informed model selection.

*Jin Young Kim,Jeremy Hudson,Jeongchul Kim,Qing Lyu,Christopher T. Whitlow*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MCR-VQGAN synthesizes tau PET images from T1-weighted MRI, achieving superior image quality and preserving diagnostic features for Alzheimer's disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tau PET imaging is crucial for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis but faces barriers including radiation exposure, limited availability, high costs, and clinical workload. There's a need for accessible alternatives.

Method: Proposed Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) with three key enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Trained on 222 paired T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from ADNI, compared against cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN.

Result: MCR-VQGAN achieved superior synthesis performance: MSE 0.0056±0.0061, PSNR 24.39±4.49 dB, SSIM 0.9000±0.0453. CNN-based AD classifier showed comparable accuracy on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images, indicating preserved diagnostic features.

Conclusion: MCR-VQGAN offers a reliable, scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease research and clinical workflows.

Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it visualizes and quantifies neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.

*Linnea Evanson,Mingfang,Zhang,Hubert Banville,Saarang Panchavati,Pierre Bourdillon,Jean-Rémi King*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A framework using week-long intracranial recordings pretrains contrastive learning models that substantially outperform models trained only on short experimental data, with gains scaling log-linearly with dataset size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous speech decoding from brain activity has been limited by small datasets from short, controlled experiments. The authors aim to leverage much larger datasets from clinical monitoring to improve decoding performance.

Method: Use week-long intracranial and audio recordings from clinical monitoring patients as pretraining data, effectively increasing training dataset size by over 100x. Apply contrastive learning models and analyze learned representations.

Result: The contrastive learning model with pretraining substantially outperforms models trained only on classic experimental data, with gains scaling log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis reveals brain activity represents speech features but drifts across days.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable path for decoding brain representations in real-life and controlled settings, but models need to explicitly account for cross-day variability due to neural drift.

Abstract: Decoding speech from brain activity has typically relied on limited neural recordings collected during short and highly controlled experiments. Here, we introduce a framework to leverage week-long intracranial and audio recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, effectively increasing the training dataset size by over two orders of magnitude. With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability. Overall, our approach opens a scalable path toward decoding and modeling brain representations in both real-life and controlled task settings.

### [166] [Auto-Tuning Safety Guardrails for Black-Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15782)
*Perry Abdulkadir*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Treating safety guardrails as hyperparameters to optimize for black-box LLM deployments, using automated search to find effective configurations with fewer evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety guardrails for LLMs (system prompts, content filters) are typically hand-tuned, brittle, and difficult to reproduce, especially when model weights cannot be modified. There's a need for more systematic approaches to harden black-box LLM deployments.

Method: Treat safety guardrail design as a hyperparameter optimization problem over a frozen base model (Mistral-7B-Instruct). Use modular jailbreak and malware system prompts plus a ModernBERT-based harmfulness classifier. Evaluate configurations on three public benchmarks covering malware generation, classic jailbreak prompts, and benign user queries. Score using attack success rate, harmful-response rate, and latency. Compare grid search baseline with black-box Optuna optimization.

Result: Optuna reliably rediscovers the best grid configurations while requiring an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and roughly 8x less wall-clock time compared to exhaustive grid search.

Conclusion: Viewing safety guardrails as tunable hyperparameters is a feasible way to harden black-box LLM deployments under compute and time constraints, offering a systematic alternative to hand-tuned approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed behind safety guardrails such as system prompts and content filters, especially in settings where product teams cannot modify model weights. In practice these guardrails are typically hand-tuned, brittle, and difficult to reproduce. This paper studies a simple but practical alternative: treat safety guardrail design itself as a hyperparameter optimization problem over a frozen base model. Concretely, I wrap Mistral-7B-Instruct with modular jailbreak and malware system prompts plus a ModernBERT-based harmfulness classifier, then evaluate candidate configurations on three public benchmarks covering malware generation, classic jailbreak prompts, and benign user queries. Each configuration is scored using malware and jailbreak attack success rate, benign harmful-response rate, and end-to-end latency. A 48-point grid search over prompt combinations and filter modes establishes a baseline. I then run a black-box Optuna study over the same space and show that it reliably rediscovers the best grid configurations while requiring an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and roughly 8x less wall-clock time. The results suggest that viewing safety guardrails as tunable hyperparameters is a feasible way to harden black-box LLM deployments under compute and time constraints.

### [167] [ContextLeak: Auditing Leakage in Private In-Context Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16059)
*Jacob Choi,Shuying Cao,Xingjian Dong,Wang Bill Zhu,Robin Jia,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ContextLeak is the first framework to empirically measure worst-case information leakage in In-Context Learning, using canary insertion and targeted queries to audit privacy-preserving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-Context Learning (ICL) uses task-specific exemplars that may contain sensitive information, requiring privacy-preserving mechanisms. While many methods exist to protect information leakage, there's a lack of auditing frameworks to measure their effectiveness.

Method: ContextLeak uses canary insertion - embedding uniquely identifiable tokens in exemplars and crafting targeted queries to detect their presence. It empirically measures worst-case information leakage across various private ICL techniques.

Result: ContextLeak tightly correlates with theoretical privacy budget (ε) and reliably detects leakage. Results show existing methods often have poor privacy-utility trade-offs, either leaking sensitive information or severely degrading performance.

Conclusion: ContextLeak provides the first empirical framework for auditing privacy-preserving ICL methods, revealing that current approaches need improvement in balancing privacy protection with utility maintenance.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a standard technique for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks by supplying task-specific exemplars within the prompt. However, when these exemplars contain sensitive information, reliable privacy-preserving mechanisms are essential to prevent unintended leakage through model outputs. Many privacy-preserving methods are proposed to protect the information leakage in the context, but there are less efforts on how to audit those methods. We introduce ContextLeak, the first framework to empirically measure the worst-case information leakage in ICL. ContextLeak uses canary insertion, embedding uniquely identifiable tokens in exemplars and crafting targeted queries to detect their presence. We apply ContextLeak across a range of private ICL techniques, both heuristic such as prompt-based defenses and those with theoretical guarantees such as Embedding Space Aggregation and Report Noisy Max. We find that ContextLeak tightly correlates with the theoretical privacy budget ($ε$) and reliably detects leakage. Our results further reveal that existing methods often strike poor privacy-utility trade-offs, either leaking sensitive information or severely degrading performance.

*Hao Li,Yubing Ren,Yanan Cao,Yingjie Li,Fang Fang,Shi Wang,Li Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DualGuard is a novel LLM watermarking algorithm that defends against both paraphrase and piggyback spoofing attacks using adaptive dual-stream watermarking, enabling detection and tracing of spoofing attacks while maintaining text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more accessible through cloud services, risks of model abuse increase. Existing watermarking algorithms only defend against paraphrase attacks but overlook piggyback spoofing attacks, which can inject harmful content, compromise watermark reliability, and undermine trust in attribution.

Method: DualGuard employs an adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism where two complementary watermark signals are dynamically injected based on semantic content. This design enables detection and tracing of spoofing attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and language models show DualGuard achieves excellent detectability, robustness, traceability, and text quality, effectively advancing LLM watermarking for real-world applications.

Conclusion: DualGuard is the first watermarking algorithm capable of defending against both paraphrase and spoofing attacks, ensuring reliable and trustworthy watermark detection for LLM protection in practical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud-based services, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly accessible through various web platforms. However, this accessibility has also led to growing risks of model abuse. LLM watermarking has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate such misuse and protect intellectual property. Existing watermarking algorithms, however, primarily focus on defending against paraphrase attacks while overlooking piggyback spoofing attacks, which can inject harmful content, compromise watermark reliability, and undermine trust in attribution. To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard, the first watermarking algorithm capable of defending against both paraphrase and spoofing attacks. DualGuard employs the adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism, in which two complementary watermark signals are dynamically injected based on the semantic content. This design enables DualGuard not only to detect but also to trace spoofing attacks, thereby ensuring reliable and trustworthy watermark detection. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets and language models demonstrate that DualGuard achieves excellent detectability, robustness, traceability, and text quality, effectively advancing the state of LLM watermarking for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TOP-R is a new privacy risk in LLM-based autonomous agents where agents can autonomously aggregate information fragments across multiple tools to synthesize sensitive information, despite benign user goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-agent, multi-tool architectures for autonomous agents prioritize helpfulness over privacy, creating a fundamental risk where agents can orchestrate information from multiple tools to infer sensitive data that wasn't explicitly requested.

Method: 1) Formal framework attributing risk to misaligned objective functions; 2) TOP-Bench benchmark with paired leakage/benign scenarios; 3) H-Score metric for safety-robustness trade-off; 4) Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) mitigation method.

Result: TOP-R is severe: average Risk Leakage Rate of 8 models reaches 90.24%, average H-Score only 0.167 (none exceed 0.3). PEP method reduces RLR to 46.58% and improves H-Score to 0.624.

Conclusion: The work reveals a new class of privacy risk and structural limitations in current agent architectures, while providing effective mitigation strategies through the PEP method.

Abstract: Driven by Large Language Models, the single-agent, multi-tool architecture has become a popular paradigm for autonomous agents due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SemMark is a semantic-based watermarking method for protecting Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) copyright by injecting watermarks into specific semantic regions using locality-sensitive hashing and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EaaS watermarking methods ignore semantic properties, resulting in limited harmlessness and stealthiness. There's a need for semantic-aware watermarking to better protect intellectual property while maintaining embedding quality.

Method: Uses locality-sensitive hashing to partition semantic space, injects semantic-aware watermarks into specific regions, employs adaptive watermark weight mechanism based on local outlier factor to preserve original embedding distribution, and evaluates against Detect-Sampling and Dimensionality-Reduction attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on four NLP datasets show SemMark achieves superior verifiability, diversity, stealthiness, and harmlessness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SemMark provides an effective semantic-based watermarking paradigm for EaaS copyright protection that addresses the limitations of existing methods by considering semantic properties while maintaining embedding quality.

Abstract: Benefiting from the superior capabilities of large language models in natural language understanding and generation, Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) has emerged as a successful commercial paradigm on the web platform. However, prior studies have revealed that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks. Existing methods protect the intellectual property of EaaS through watermarking techniques, but they all ignore the most important properties of embedding: semantics, resulting in limited harmlessness and stealthiness. To this end, we propose SemMark, a novel semantic-based watermarking paradigm for EaaS copyright protection. SemMark employs locality-sensitive hashing to partition the semantic space and inject semantic-aware watermarks into specific regions, ensuring that the watermark signals remain imperceptible and diverse. In addition, we introduce the adaptive watermark weight mechanism based on the local outlier factor to preserve the original embedding distribution. Furthermore, we propose Detect-Sampling and Dimensionality-Reduction attacks and construct four scenarios to evaluate the watermarking method. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular NLP datasets, and SemMark achieves superior verifiability, diversity, stealthiness, and harmlessness.

TL;DR: Post-hoc watermarking rewrites existing text with LLMs to embed statistical signals for AI content traceability, offering better quality-detectability trade-offs than generation-time approaches, with varying effectiveness across text types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect copyrighted documents and detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity, enabling traceability of AI-generated content through statistical signals embedded in text.

Method: Post-hoc watermarking where LLMs rewrite existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, exploring compute allocation strategies (larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, entropy filtering) and comparing Gumbel-max scheme with alternatives under nucleus sampling.

Result: Strong detectability and semantic fidelity achieved on open-ended text like books; Gumbel-max surprisingly outperforms recent alternatives under nucleus sampling; beam search benefits most methods; smaller models outperform larger ones for verifiable text like code.

Conclusion: Post-hoc watermarking shows both potential and limitations, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research, with effectiveness varying significantly between open-ended and verifiable text types.

Abstract: Generation-time text watermarking embeds statistical signals into text for traceability of AI-generated content. We explore *post-hoc watermarking* where an LLM rewrites existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, to protect copyrighted documents, or detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity. Unlike generation-time approaches, which is constrained by how LLMs are served, this setting offers additional degrees of freedom for both generation and detection. We investigate how allocating compute (through larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, or entropy filtering at detection) affects the quality-detectability trade-off. Our strategies achieve strong detectability and semantic fidelity on open-ended text such as books. Among our findings, the simple Gumbel-max scheme surprisingly outperforms more recent alternatives under nucleus sampling, and most methods benefit significantly from beam search. However, most approaches struggle when watermarking verifiable text such as code, where we counterintuitively find that smaller models outperform larger ones. This study reveals both the potential and limitations of post-hoc watermarking, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning object detection models are vulnerable to adversarial examples in critical applications like autonomous driving and security surveillance, necessitating effective defense mechanisms.

Method: Propose autoencoder-based denoising defense using single-layer convolutional autoencoder to remove adversarial perturbations from images attacked with Perlin noise, evaluated on YOLOv5 with COCO vehicle images.

Result: Adversarial attacks reduced bbox mAP from 0.2890 to 0.1640 (43.3% degradation). Autoencoder defense recovered bbox mAP to 0.1700 (3.7% recovery) and improved bbox mAP@50 from 0.2780 to 0.3080 (10.8% improvement).

Conclusion: Autoencoder-based denoising provides partial defense against adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining, though recovery is limited and further improvements are needed for robust protection.

Abstract: Deep learning-based object detection models play a critical role in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and security surveillance systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose an autoencoder-based denoising defense to recover object detection performance degraded by adversarial perturbations. We conduct adversarial attacks using Perlin noise on vehicle-related images from the COCO dataset, apply a single-layer convolutional autoencoder to remove the perturbations, and evaluate detection performance using YOLOv5. Our experiments demonstrate that adversarial attacks reduce bbox mAP from 0.2890 to 0.1640, representing a 43.3% performance degradation. After applying the proposed autoencoder defense, bbox mAP improves to 0.1700 (3.7% recovery) and bbox mAP@50 increases from 0.2780 to 0.3080 (10.8% improvement). These results indicate that autoencoder-based denoising can provide partial defense against adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining.

TL;DR: Foundation models show promise in biomedical imaging but face significant challenges in clinical deployment, requiring hybrid, causally-aware systems that augment rather than replace human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess the gap between the potential of foundation models in biomedical imaging and current clinical deployment challenges, examining whether they exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic patterns.

Method: Critical assessment of state-of-the-art, taxonomy of reasoning capabilities, analysis of core capabilities vs. limitations, and examination of deployment challenges including trustworthiness, bias, and safety.

Result: Identifies significant challenges in clinical evaluation and deployment, highlighting the need for causal inference beyond statistical correlation, and addressing issues of algorithmic bias, data privacy, and model hallucinations.

Conclusion: While autonomous AI-doctors remain distant, immediate potential lies in assistive tools; future success depends on developing hybrid, causally-aware, verifiably safe systems that augment human expertise rather than scale alone.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are driving a prominent shift in artificial intelligence across different domains, including biomedical imaging. These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise.

TL;DR: DP-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating automatic data product creation, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation in this field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While data products have been created manually/semi-automatically for over a decade to solve specific business problems and provide insights, there's no existing benchmark to evaluate automatic data product creation methods.

Method: Created DP-Bench benchmark by leveraging existing ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) and Text-to-SQL benchmarks, and proposed several LLM-based approaches as baselines for automatic data product generation.

Result: Developed DP-Bench, the first benchmark for automatic data product creation, with supplementary materials made publicly available on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: DP-Bench fills a critical gap by providing a standardized evaluation framework for automatic data product creation, enabling better comparison and advancement of methods in this field.

Abstract: A data product is created with the intention of solving a specific problem, addressing a specific business usecase or meeting a particular need, going beyond just serving data as a raw asset. Data products enable end users to gain greater insights about their data. Since it was first introduced over a decade ago, there has been considerable work, especially in industry, to create data products manually or semi-automatically. However, there exists hardly any benchmark to evaluate automatic data product creation. In this work, we present a benchmark, first of its kind, for this task. We call it DP-Bench. We describe how this benchmark was created by taking advantage of existing work in ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) and Text-to-SQL benchmarks. We also propose a number of LLM based approaches that can be considered as baselines for generating data products automatically. We make the DP-Bench and supplementary materials available in https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibm-research/dp-bench .

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Large Video Planner (LVP) is a robot foundation model trained on internet-scale video data that generates video plans for novel tasks and scenes, which are then converted to executable robot actions, demonstrating zero-shot generalization and real-world feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot foundation models extend multimodal LLMs with action outputs (VLA systems), but this work explores an alternative paradigm using large-scale video pretraining as the primary modality. Videos naturally capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions aligned with robotic behavior, unlike static images and language.

Method: 1. Curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations. 2. Train a foundation-scale open video model for generative robotics planning. 3. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks. 4. Post-process video plans to extract executable robot actions.

Result: The model demonstrates robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments. It successfully produces executable actions for novel tasks without task-specific training.

Conclusion: Video-based foundation models are a viable alternative to language/image-based approaches for robotics, offering natural alignment with robotic behavior through spatio-temporal sequences. The released model and dataset support open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

Abstract: General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning. Our website is available at https://www.boyuan.space/large-video-planner/.

TL;DR: VERM method uses foundation models to create virtual task-adaptive views from 3D point clouds, filtering redundant multi-camera information for faster and more efficient robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-camera setups in 3D robotic manipulation introduce redundancy and irrelevant information, increasing computational costs and requiring extra training time to extract crucial task-relevant details.

Method: VERM leverages foundation models to imagine virtual task-adaptive views from 3D point clouds, with a depth-aware module and dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure for 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x training speedup and 1.54x inference speedup on RLBench simulation benchmark and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: VERM effectively filters redundant information, captures necessary task-relevant features, mitigates occlusion, and enables efficient 3D robotic manipulation with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: When performing 3D manipulation tasks, robots have to execute action planning based on perceptions from multiple fixed cameras. The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UGC videos have higher variability and diverse characteristics than traditional test videos, which challenges data-driven ML algorithms for encoding optimization in UGC scenarios.

Method: Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework with three adaptive components: 1) adaptive factor to regulate preprocessing intensity, 2) adaptive quantization level to fine-tune codec simulator, 3) adaptive lambda tradeoff to adjust rate-distortion loss function.

Result: Experimental results on large-scale test sets demonstrate that the method attains exceptional performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of UGC video variability for encoding optimization.

Abstract: In recent years, user generated content (UGC) has become the dominant force in internet traffic. However, UGC videos exhibit a higher degree of variability and diverse characteristics compared to traditional encoding test videos. This variance challenges the effectiveness of data-driven machine learning algorithms for optimizing encoding in the broader context of UGC scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework for UGC. Firstly, we employ an adaptive factor to regulate preprocessing intensity. Secondly, an adaptive quantization level is employed to fine-tune the codec simulator. Thirdly, we utilize an adaptive lambda tradeoff to adjust the rate-distortion loss function. Experimental results on large-scale test sets demonstrate that our method attains exceptional performance.

### [180] [QuadSentinel: Sequent Safety for Machine-Checkable Control in Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16279)
*Yiliu Yang,Yilei Jiang,Qunzhong Wang,Yingshui Tan,Xiaoyong Zhu,Sherman S. M. Chow,Bo Zheng,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuadSentinel is a four-agent guardrail system that compiles natural language safety policies into machine-checkable rules to improve safety enforcement for LLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety risks emerge as LLM-based agents perform complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent communication. Natural language safety policies are ambiguous and context-dependent, making them difficult to map to machine-checkable rules, leading to unreliable runtime enforcement.

Method: Express safety policies as sequents and use a four-agent system (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state. Includes referee logic and efficient top-k predicate updater to prioritize checks and resolve conflicts hierarchically.

Result: Tested on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA '25) and AgentHarm (ICLR '25), QuadSentinel improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Outperforms single-agent baselines like ShieldAgent (ICML '25) for overall safety control.

Conclusion: QuadSentinel provides a deployable pattern for safety enforcement without modifying core agents, keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. The approach offers better safety control for LLM-based agents performing complex tasks.

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic framework for understanding adaptation strategies in agentic AI systems, categorizing them into agent adaptations and tool adaptations with specific sub-types, offering practical guidance for system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As agentic AI systems become more complex and capable, adaptation has become crucial for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. However, the research landscape is rapidly expanding without a unified framework to understand different adaptation strategies and their trade-offs.

Method: The authors develop a systematic framework that unifies adaptation strategies into two main categories: agent adaptations (with tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms) and tool adaptations (with agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms). They analyze the design space, trade-offs, and provide practical guidance for selecting strategies during system design.

Result: The framework clarifies the design space of adaptation strategies, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for researchers and practitioners. It helps in selecting or switching among strategies during system design by reviewing representative approaches in each category and analyzing their strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: This paper offers both a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for building more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems by providing a systematic understanding of adaptation strategies and their applications in agentic AI development.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: Needle in the Web is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM search agents on fuzzy exploratory search tasks with ambiguous queries, showing current systems struggle with below 35% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search where queries are vague and multifaceted, and users seek relevant webpages rather than single factual answers.

Method: Introduces Needle in the Web benchmark with 663 questions across seven domains, using flexible methodology to generate queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims from web content.

Result: Benchmarked three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems, finding most models struggle with below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Needle in the Web presents significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

### [183] [Generative Adversarial Reasoner: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16917)
*Qihao Liu,Luoxin Ye,Wufei Ma,Yu-Cheng Chou,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Adversarial Reasoner (GAR) uses adversarial reinforcement learning with an LLM reasoner and discriminator to improve mathematical reasoning by providing dense step-level rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with reasoning capabilities still make process errors like incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and invalid steps, despite excelling at mathematical reasoning. Current approaches lack effective mechanisms to detect and correct these step-by-step errors during training.

Method: Introduces Generative Adversarial Reasoner (GAR), an on-policy joint training framework where an LLM reasoner and LLM-based discriminator co-evolve through adversarial reinforcement learning. Uses a compute-efficient review schedule to partition reasoning chains into logically complete slices. The discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with structured justifications, providing dense step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals.

Result: Achieves consistent gains across mathematical benchmarks. On AIME24, improves DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator enables flexible reward shaping for various objectives.

Conclusion: GAR effectively enhances LLM reasoning quality by providing dense, well-calibrated step-level rewards through adversarial training, improving credit assignment and sample efficiency while enabling flexible reward shaping for different reasoning objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: IPNet is a neuromorphic architecture using MTJ neurons with intrinsic plasticity to emulate human-like working memory, achieving high accuracy on dynamic vision tasks while drastically reducing energy consumption and footprint compared to conventional neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current artificial networks for working memory (RNNs, LSTMs) incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. The paper aims to create a bio-plausible, energy-efficient neuromorphic architecture that physically emulates biological memory volatility for superior dynamic vision processing.

Method: Hardware-software co-designed architecture using Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) neurons that exploit Joule-heating dynamics to physically emulate biological memory volatility. The design implements human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity without capacitors, enabling compact footprint.

Result: Achieved 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and 99.48% on 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN/LSTM/CNN baselines. Reduced steering prediction error by 14.4% for autonomous driving. Memory power reduced 2,874x vs LSTMs and 90,920x vs 3D-CNNs. Compact ~1.5um² footprint with >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons.

Conclusion: Instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity in neuromorphic hardware provides dual advantages: superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm with physical realizability confirmed through hardware-in-the-loop validation.

Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particulate composites have complex microstructures that strongly influence performance, but analyzing large-scale multimodal X-ray imaging data to discover physical insights and optimize microstructures remains challenging.

Method: Developed a machine learning-enabled framework that automatically transforms experimental multimodal X-ray images of multiphase particulate composites into scalable, topology-aware graphs for analysis at particle and network levels.

Result: Applied to solid-state lithium battery cathodes, the graph analysis confirmed the critical role of triple phase junctions and concurrent ion/electron conduction channels in achieving desirable local electrochemical activity.

Conclusion: Graph-based microstructure representation serves as a powerful paradigm for bridging multimodal experimental imaging with functional understanding, enabling microstructure-aware data-driven materials design across various particulate composites.

Abstract: Particulate composites underpin many solid-state chemical and electrochemical systems, where microstructural features such as multiphase boundaries and inter-particle connections strongly influence system performance. Advances in X-ray microscopy enable capturing large-scale, multimodal images of these complex microstructures with an unprecedentedly high throughput. However, harnessing these datasets to discover new physical insights and guide microstructure optimization remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a machine learning (ML) enabled framework that enables automated transformation of experimental multimodal X-ray images of multiphase particulate composites into scalable, topology-aware graphs for extracting physical insights and establishing local microstructure-property relationships at both the particle and network level. Using the multiphase particulate cathode of solid-state lithium batteries as an example, our ML-enabled graph analysis corroborates the critical role of triple phase junctions and concurrent ion/electron conduction channels in realizing desirable local electrochemical activity. Our work establishes graph-based microstructure representation as a powerful paradigm for bridging multimodal experimental imaging and functional understanding, and facilitating microstructure-aware data-driven materials design in a broad range of particulate composites.
