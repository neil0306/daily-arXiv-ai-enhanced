### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBA introduces counterbias data augmentation that decomposes text into semantic triples and modifies them to disrupt spurious correlations, improving model robustness and reducing biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often exploit spurious correlations in training data, leading to poor generalization and performance degradation on unseen data.

Method: Counterbias data augmentation framework that operates at semantic triple level: decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, selectively modifying them to disrupt spurious correlations, and reconstructing text from adjusted triples.

Result: CoBA improves downstream task performance, effectively reduces biases, and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CoBA offers a versatile and robust solution to address challenges posed by spurious correlations in deep learning models.

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First large-scale German toxic speech dataset with age estimates, showing age-based differences in toxic language patterns between younger and older users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits understanding of how different age groups communicate online, particularly in German language contexts.

Method: Collaborated with German public service network to collect 33,048 comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube (3,024 human-annotated + 30,024 LLM-annotated), using toxic keywords for relevance and combining human expertise with state-of-the-art language models for annotation.

Result: Dataset revealed age-based differences: younger users favor expressive language while older users more often engage in disinformation and devaluation. 16.7% of comments were labeled as problematic, with categories including insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.

Conclusion: The dataset provides new opportunities for studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports development of more equitable, age-aware content moderation systems.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit anchoring bias in price negotiations similar to humans, with reasoning models showing reduced susceptibility but no correlation with personality traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cognitive biases like anchoring effect in LLMs during price negotiations, as these biases affect LLM reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Instructed seller LLM agents to apply anchoring effect and evaluated negotiations using both objective and subjective metrics. Analyzed relationship with reasoning capabilities and personality traits.

Result: LLMs are influenced by anchoring effect like humans. Reasoning models are less prone to anchoring, suggesting chain of thought mitigates the effect. No significant correlation found between personality traits and susceptibility.

Conclusion: Findings contribute to understanding cognitive biases in LLMs and support development of safe, responsible LLM applications in society.

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs show surprisingly poor performance on basic visual perception tasks with generated images, despite excelling at complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' fundamental visual perception abilities using uncontaminated generated images with basic shapes, as previous research focused mainly on complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Created Percept-V dataset with 7200 program-generated images across 30 categories testing various visual perception skills, then tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude) and LRMs (OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1).

Result: Significant performance drop with increasing problem complexity across all models and categories. Models show similar accuracy patterns, with some cognitive skills being more challenging than others.

Conclusion: MLLMs struggle with basic visual perception despite strong performance on complex tasks, revealing important limitations in their fundamental visual understanding capabilities.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey presents a data-centric analysis of Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs), framing their development as co-evolution between models and scientific data, with comprehensive taxonomies of data and knowledge structures across disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex nature of scientific data poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring specialized approaches that differ from general NLP. Sci-LLMs need to handle multimodal, cross-scale, domain-specific data with uncertainty and require representations that preserve domain invariance while enabling cross-modal reasoning.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey with: 1) Unified taxonomy of scientific data and hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, 2) Systematic review of recent Sci-LLMs across disciplines, 3) Analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, 4) Examination of over 190 benchmark datasets with evaluation protocols.

Result: The analysis reveals that scientific corpora are heterogeneous, multi-scale, and uncertainty-laden, requiring distinct approaches. The survey traces a shift from static evaluations toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols for Sci-LLMs.

Conclusion: The work outlines a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous Sci-LLM agents actively experiment and contribute to evolving knowledge bases, providing a roadmap for building trustworthy AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery as true partners.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

### [8] [Quantifying Label-Induced Bias in Large Language Model Self- and Cross-Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21164)
*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM evaluation scores are heavily biased by model identity labels, with Claude labels boosting scores and Gemini labels depressing them, regardless of actual content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how bias affects LLM evaluations when models evaluate outputs from themselves and other models, particularly when model identity labels are present or manipulated.

Method: Used ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to evaluate blog posts under four label conditions: no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Measured both overall preference voting and quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness.

Result: Significant bias found - Claude labels consistently increased scores while Gemini labels decreased them. False labels reversed rankings with up to 50 percentage point shifts in preference votes and 12 point shifts in quality ratings. Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels.

Conclusion: Model identity perception heavily distorts LLM evaluations, requiring blind or multimodel evaluation protocols for fair benchmarking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

*Deepro Choudhury,Sinead Williamson,Adam Goliński,Ning Miao,Freddie Bickford Smith,Michael Kirchhof,Yizhe Zhang,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BED-LLM improves LLMs' ability to gather information adaptively using Bayesian experimental design, achieving better performance in multi-turn conversations and preference inference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' capability to intelligently gather information from users or external sources through adaptive questioning, making them more effective conversational agents.

Method: Uses sequential Bayesian experimental design framework with expected information gain maximization, probabilistic modeling from LLM beliefs, specialized EIG estimator, and targeted query proposal strategies.

Result: Substantial performance gains across 20-questions game and user preference inference tasks compared to direct prompting and other adaptive strategies.

Conclusion: BED-LLM provides a principled framework for LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents by adaptively gathering information through Bayesian experimental design.

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

*Arash Ahmadi,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Banad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated HFACS classification framework using RL with GRPO to fine-tune Llama-3.1 8B model for aviation safety analysis, achieving 350% accuracy improvement and outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HFACS methods for aviation accident analysis suffer from scalability and consistency limitations, requiring automated solutions for better safety analysis.

Method: Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune Llama-3.1 8B language model, incorporating multi-component reward system and synthetic data generation to address class imbalance.

Result: 350% increase in exact match accuracy (0.0400 to 0.1800), improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800, outperforming GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-flash on key metrics.

Conclusion: Smaller, domain-optimized models provide computationally efficient solutions for safety analysis, enabling low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, with exact match accuracy proposed as new benchmarking methodology.

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pixel-based language model replaces text embeddings with visual word representations to defend against orthographic attacks and support multilingual text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks using multilingual characters, causing performance degradation due to subword tokenizer limitations.

Method: Propose pixel-based generative language model that renders words as individual images instead of using text-based embeddings, providing robustness to noisy inputs.

Result: Evaluated on multilingual LAMBADA, WMT24, and SST-2 benchmarks, showing resilience to orthographic noise and effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Conclusion: Pixel-based representations offer stronger robustness against orthographic attacks and enable better compatibility with diverse multilingual writing systems compared to traditional text embeddings.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

### [12] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised speech models do not show clear Critical Period effects in phonological acquisition, unlike human language learning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Critical Period effects observed in human language acquisition (difficulty with delayed L2 exposure and L1 retention with delayed L1 offset) are present in self-supervised speech models, given the importance of spoken language in human learning.

Method: Trained self-supervised speech models with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training offsets on child-directed speech, then evaluated their phone discrimination performance.

Result: S3Ms do not exhibit clear Critical Period effects. Models with delayed L2 exposure onset performed better on L2, and delayed L1 exposure offset led to L1 forgetting - opposite patterns to human language acquisition.

Conclusion: Self-supervised speech models do not replicate human-like Critical Period effects in phonological learning, suggesting fundamental differences between artificial and human language acquisition mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

*Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu,Feiyi Wang,Dan Lu,Junqi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates self-consistency methods for hallucination detection by identifying redundant prefix tokens and using selective inference, achieving 3x speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods perform poorly on sentence-level generation and self-consistency approaches incur high computational costs due to repeated generation with redundant tokens.

Method: Identifies redundancy in self-consistency methods through shared prefix tokens analysis, then proposes DMP with selective inference and annealed decoding to accelerate generation while maintaining semantic content.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves up to 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance, being orthogonal to model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline.

Conclusion: DMP consistently improves efficiency of multi-response generation and holds promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks, addressing computational cost issues in self-consistency methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: jina-code-embeddings is a compact code embedding model suite that achieves state-of-the-art performance for code retrieval from natural language queries, technical QA, and cross-language code similarity detection using an autoregressive backbone with last-token pooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient code embedding models that can effectively bridge natural language queries with code retrieval, handle technical question-answering, and identify semantically similar code across different programming languages, while maintaining relatively small model sizes.

Method: Uses an autoregressive backbone pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings through last-token pooling technique. The approach focuses on an innovative training recipe for code embedding model construction.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in code retrieval and semantic similarity tasks despite the models' relatively small size, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The jina-code-embeddings suite successfully validates the use of autoregressive backbones with last-token pooling for building efficient and high-performing code embedding models that work across multiple programming languages and code-related tasks.

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical
question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across
programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone
pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

### [17] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the Turing test through the concept of normality, arguing it tests average human intelligence requiring imperfect behavior, and suggests current AI models target exceptional intelligence rather than normal intelligence needed to pass the test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and reinterpret the Turing test through the lens of normality and statistical averages, challenging conventional understandings of what constitutes artificial intelligence.

Method: Conceptual analysis of the Turing test using statistical interpretation of normality, examining both the target intelligence (normal human intelligence) and the judging mechanism (statistical aggregation of multiple judges).

Result: The paper concludes that large language models like ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as they target exceptional rather than normal human intelligence, representing artificial smartness rather than true artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: The Turing test is fundamentally a test of normal intelligence assessed through statistical aggregation, raising deeper questions about whether human cognition can be reduced to average/normal minds and challenging the normalist paradigm underlying the test.

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

TL;DR: Study reveals reproducibility issues in text summarization evaluation metrics, showing discrepancies between reported and actual performance, with a trade-off between human alignment and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate reproducibility challenges in automatic text summarization evaluation and highlight discrepancies between reported metric performances in literature versus experimental results.

Method: Conducted experiments across six representative metrics (including ROUGE and LLM-based methods like G-Eval, SEval-Ex) using a unified open-source framework applied to the SummEval dataset for fair comparison.

Result: Found significant performance discrepancies between literature reports and experimental results, revealing a structural trade-off: metrics with highest human judgment alignment are computationally intensive and less stable across runs. LLM-based methods show randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility.

Conclusion: Advocates for more robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic summarization assessment, highlighting concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation.

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

*Nils Dycke,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs used as automatic review generators fail to detect flaws in research logic, showing no significant difference in reviews of papers with vs without logical errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities and limitations of automatic review generators (ARGs) in scholarly peer review, particularly their ability to detect faulty research logic which is crucial for scientific integrity.

Method: Developed a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests ARGs' ability to detect research logic flaws under controlled conditions by comparing reviews of papers with and without logical inconsistencies.

Result: Contrary to expectations, flaws in research logic had no significant effect on ARG output reviews - they failed to detect logical inconsistencies between results, interpretations, and claims.

Conclusion: Current ARGs lack the critical skill of detecting faulty research logic, posing risks to scientific integrity; authors provide three actionable recommendations and release their evaluation framework and dataset publicly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-RewardBench is the first benchmark for evaluating medical reward models and judges, featuring 1,026 expert-annotated cases across 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments with six critical clinical dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MLLMs require highly accurate and clinically aligned responses, but existing benchmarks focus on general capabilities rather than essential medical evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance.

Method: Created a multimodal dataset with rigorous three-step annotation process covering 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments. Evaluated 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs and developed baseline models through fine-tuning.

Result: Revealed substantial challenges in aligning MLLM outputs with expert judgment. Baseline models showed significant performance improvements after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench addresses the critical gap in medical reward model evaluation and demonstrates the importance of specialized benchmarks for clinical alignment of MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

### [21] [Discovering Semantic Subdimensions through Disentangled Conceptual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21436)
*Yunhao Zhang,Shaonan Wang,Nan Lin,Xinyi Dong,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to discover fine-grained semantic subdimensions from word embeddings, using a disentangled model to identify interpretable subdimensions and validate them through neural mapping to brain activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic dimension approaches use predefined coarse representations that miss finer conceptual distinctions, limiting understanding of how meaning is organized in language and the brain.

Method: Introduces Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes LLM word embeddings into multiple sub-embeddings encoding specific semantics, then uses voxel-wise encoding models to map subdimensions to brain activation.

Result: Identifies interpretable semantic subdimensions with polarity as key decomposition factor, and finds neural correlates supporting their cognitive and neuroscientific plausibility.

Conclusion: The framework provides fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions that reveal distinct structural principles and have validated neural plausibility, advancing understanding of conceptual meaning organization.

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [22] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit ideological leanings with varying depth - some models are easily steerable while others show resistance, revealing quantifiable ideological depth through steerability measurements and sparse autoencoder analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability and coherence of ideological positions in LLMs, as surface-level responses can be manipulated but may not reflect genuine underlying political representations.

Method: Dual approach: 1) Measuring steerability using instruction prompting and activation steering on open-source LLMs, 2) Probing internal mechanisms with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify ideological features.

Result: Models with lower steerability have more distinct abstract ideological features (up to 7.3x more political features). Targeted ablation in deep models causes consistent logical shifts, while shallow models increase refusal rates.

Conclusion: Ideological depth is quantifiable in LLMs, and steerability provides valuable insight into their latent political architecture, with some models exhibiting more entrenched ideological structures than others.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

*Xiaolong Wei,Bo Lu,Xingyu Zhang,Zhejun Zhao,Dongdong Shen,Long Xia,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents two AI-driven reward strategies (RLAIF framework) to enhance creative writing in 7B-parameter Small Language Models for Chinese greetings, showing superior results with principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong creative writing capabilities but high computational costs. SLMs are promising alternatives but current methods like SFT struggle with novelty and RLHF is expensive. Need scalable solutions for creative SLMs.

Method: Two RLAIF strategies: 1) RM trained on high-quality preference data from multi-agent rejection sampling, 2) Principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge with adversarial training and reflection mechanism. Tested on 7B-parameter SLM for Chinese greeting generation.

Result: Both approaches significantly enhance creative output over baselines. Principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge yields superior generation quality, better training efficiency, and reduced human-annotation dependency. Automated evaluation aligns well with human judgments.

Conclusion: Principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge offers a more scalable and effective path for creative SLMs, demonstrating strong performance with reduced human data requirements and better efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

*Sara B. Coutinho,Rafael M. O. Cruz,Francimaria R. S. Nascimento,George D. C. Cavalcanti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel automatic classifier selection method for fake news detection ensembles that prioritizes diversity through hierarchical clustering and performance evaluation, achieving best accuracy on 2 of 6 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological biases make people vulnerable to fake news on social media. Ensemble methods help but depend on classifier diversity, which is challenging to achieve as models often learn redundant patterns.

Method: Proposes HierarchySelect approach: computes pairwise diversity between classifiers, applies hierarchical clustering to group them at different granularity levels, selects diverse pools per level, identifies most diverse pool while incorporating performance metrics for ensemble construction.

Result: Experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across 6 datasets show the method achieves highest accuracy on 2 of 6 datasets compared to Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed diversity-focused classifier selection method effectively improves ensemble performance for fake news detection, demonstrating the importance of systematic diversity selection in ensemble construction.

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality human-annotated sentence similarity datasets for Marathi language and improve sentence similarity modeling in low-resource settings.

Method: Created a balanced dataset with 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs uniformly distributed across six score buckets (0-5 range), then fine-tuned MahaSBERT model on this dataset for regression-based similarity scoring.

Result: MahaSBERT-STS-v2 demonstrated superior performance compared to MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT, showing the effectiveness of human-curated annotations and structured supervision.

Conclusion: Human-annotated datasets with balanced supervision significantly enhance sentence similarity modeling in low-resource languages like Marathi, and the publicly released dataset and model enable further research in Marathi NLP.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity
tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations,
targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings. The

TL;DR: Middo is a self-evolving framework that dynamically optimizes LLM training data through model-aware selection and refinement, improving data quality and model performance by 7.15% accuracy while maintaining dataset scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection and synthesis approaches for SFT LLMs suffer from static dataset curation that fails to adapt to evolving model capabilities, limiting data quality improvement.

Method: A closed-loop optimization system with: (1) self-referential diagnostic module using tri-axial model signals (loss patterns, embedding clusters, self-alignment scores), (2) adaptive optimization engine that transforms suboptimal samples while preserving semantics, (3) continuous evolution through dynamic learning principles.

Result: Experiments show Middo consistently enhances seed data quality and boosts LLM performance with 7.15% average accuracy improvement while maintaining original dataset scale.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models, enabling continuous adaptation to model capabilities.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Personality types influence LLM preferences: Rationals prefer GPT-4 for goal-oriented tasks, Idealists prefer Claude 3.5 for creative/analytical tasks, with other types showing task-dependent preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if users with different personality traits systematically prefer certain LLMs over others in multi-turn collaborative workflows.

Method: Study with 32 participants across four Keirsey personality types evaluating interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four collaborative tasks (data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval, writing assistance).

Result: Significant personality-driven preferences found: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, Idealists favored Claude 3.5. Other types showed task-dependent preferences. Sentiment analysis confirmed patterns. Aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models.

Conclusion: Personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations miss, showing systematic preferences based on personality traits rather than overall model performance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

*Jonathan Tonglet,Jan Zimny,Tinne Tuytelaars,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Misviz benchmark with 2,604 real-world misleading visualizations and Misviz-synth synthetic dataset of 81,814 visualizations for detecting and classifying 12 types of visualization misleaders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading visualizations spread misinformation on social media, but AI model development is limited by lack of large, diverse datasets for training and evaluation.

Method: Created benchmark datasets (real-world Misviz and synthetic Misviz-synth), then evaluated state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers on detection and classification tasks.

Result: The task of automatically detecting misleading visualizations remains highly challenging despite comprehensive evaluation with advanced models.

Conclusion: Released Misviz datasets and code to support future research in combating visualization-based misinformation through improved AI detection capabilities.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CPI-FT framework addresses SFT seesaw phenomenon by identifying task-specific core parameters, grouping similar tasks, and using parameter fusion with SLERP to prevent interference and forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning suffers from the 'seesaw phenomenon' where improving some tasks degrades others due to indiscriminate parameter updates.

Method: 1) Independently fine-tune on each task to identify core parameter regions 2) Group tasks with similar core regions 3) Use parameter fusion: transplant core parameters, integrate non-core via SLERP 4) Lightweight pipelined SFT with mixed-task data while freezing core regions

Result: Extensive experiments show significant alleviation of task interference and forgetting, consistently outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

Conclusion: CPI-FT effectively mitigates destructive interference in multi-task fine-tuning through core parameter isolation and fusion techniques.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

*Diane Tchuindjo,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENTAT method combines prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning to significantly improve performance on reasoning-intensive regression tasks where traditional LLM prompting and fine-tuning struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reasoning-intensive regression (RiR) tasks that require deep text analysis but have limited training data, where standard LLM approaches often fail.

Method: Propose MENTAT - a lightweight method combining batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning to enhance performance on RiR tasks.

Result: MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both frozen LLM prompting and fine-tuned Transformer encoder baselines on established RiR benchmarks.

Conclusion: While MENTAT shows substantial improvements, there remains significant room for future advances in reasoning-intensive regression tasks.

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiCSAR is a training-free method that uses joint log-likelihood of reasoning and final answer to score candidate solutions in best-of-n sampling, achieving significant performance gains with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-n sampling improves LLM/LRM accuracy but faces challenges in designing scoring functions for reasoning tasks without ground-truth answers.

Method: PiCSAR scores candidate generations using joint log-likelihood of reasoning and final answer, which decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence components.

Result: Substantial gains across benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with 2x fewer samples in 16/20 comparisons.

Conclusion: Correct reasoning chains show higher reasoning and answer confidence, validating PiCSAR's effectiveness as a simple, training-free scoring method.

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data

Result: Hybrid CNN-Random Forest model achieved best performance (85.4% accuracy), surpassing custom CNN baseline (74.3%). VGG16 performed best among pre-trained models (82.3% accuracy). Hybrid models improved discrimination of morphologically similar conditions.

Conclusion: Combining CNN-based feature extraction with ensemble classifiers provides practical automated dental diagnostic support, though larger datasets and further clinical validation are needed.

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination

diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align addresses attention leakage in zero-shot appearance transfer by using Query-Query alignment instead of Query-Key alignment, improving semantic mapping between images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image generation models suffers from Attention Leakage caused by Query-Key alignment, which hinders accurate semantic mapping between images.

Method: Q-Align introduces three components: (1) Query-Query alignment for better spatial semantic mapping, (2) Key-Value rearrangement to enhance feature correspondence, and (3) Attention refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation, as validated through extensive experiments and analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed Q-Align method effectively mitigates attention leakage and improves semantic alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer through its novel Query-Query alignment approach.

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache is a caching framework that accelerates diffusion model inference by 2x while maintaining quality through error analysis and correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from slow iterative inference, and naive caching causes quality degradation due to cumulative errors from feature shifts and step amplification.

Method: ERTACache uses offline residual profiling to identify reusable steps, dynamic integration interval adjustment via trajectory-aware correction, and closed-form residual linearization to approximate cache-induced errors.

Result: Achieves 2x inference speedup across image and video generation benchmarks while preserving or improving visual quality, with minimal VBench degradation on Wan2.1 video diffusion model.

Conclusion: ERTACache provides an effective solution for accelerating diffusion models through principled caching that jointly addresses both feature shift and step amplification errors.

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TVS is a temporal visual screening method that improves Video-LLMs by focusing on critical video segments and simplifying queries while maintaining answer consistency, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and lack of inter-frame reasoning supervision, unlike humans who naturally focus on salient temporal segments.

Method: Proposes Temporal Visual Screening (TVS) that pre-processes video QA data by: (1) retaining focus-critical segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to direct form while preserving answers, (3) maintaining answer invariance and consistency.

Result: TVS achieves relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference). The ReSimplifyIt baseline outperforms prior approaches by 0.47 F-1 score on video trimming and shows competitive query rewriting performance.

Conclusion: Temporal information screening through TVS effectively improves video-language understanding by optimizing reasoning burden distribution and aligning queries with critical visual information.

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using skeletal pose annotations instead of segmentation for surgical tool localization, as it's more efficient and enables faster growth of annotated datasets. They introduce ROBUST-MIPS dataset with both pose and segmentation annotations, and demonstrate pose estimation works well for surgical tool localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for surgical tool localization rely on segmentation annotations which are time-consuming to create, limiting the availability of diverse annotated data. The authors argue that skeletal pose annotations provide a better balance between semantic richness and annotation efficiency.

Method: The authors present ROBUST-MIPS dataset derived from ROBUST-MIS, containing both tool pose and tool instance segmentation annotations. They set up a benchmark using popular pose estimation methods to evaluate the adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localization.

Result: The study demonstrates that pose estimation methods achieve high-quality results for surgical tool localization, validating that skeletal pose annotations are an effective alternative to segmentation annotations.

Conclusion: Skeletal pose annotations are a more efficient annotation approach for surgical tools that can accelerate the growth of available annotated data while maintaining good localization performance. The released dataset, benchmark models, and annotation software aim to encourage adoption of this annotation style.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control is a plug-and-play safety patch that reduces unsafe content generation in T2I models to 7% while maintaining benign image quality, outperforming existing safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I safety mechanisms are susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments, raising safety concerns about potential misuse of text-to-image generation models.

Method: Safe-Control uses data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions to inject safety control signals into locked T2I models as a patch-like update, allowing flexible merging of multiple safety patches into a unified solution.

Result: Safe-Control reduces unsafe content generation probability to 7% compared to ~20% for baseline methods, maintains benign image quality and text alignment, and works across six diverse T2I models with similar denoising architectures.

Conclusion: Safe-Control provides an effective, adaptable plug-and-play safety solution that significantly outperforms existing safety mechanisms in mitigating unsafe content generation while preserving model performance on benign inputs.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV is a novel method for identifying target regions from natural language instructions and camera images, specifically addressing challenges with stuff-type targets and multiple/absent targets through joint existence prediction and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with stuff-type target regions that have ambiguous boundaries, and perform poorly when dealing with absent or multiple targets in navigation tasks.

Method: Proposed GENNAV system that predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. Built GRiN-Drive benchmark with no-target, single-target, and multi-target samples for evaluation.

Result: GENNAV achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard metrics. Real-world experiments with 4 automobiles in 5 distinct urban areas showed strong zero-shot transfer performance and robustness across diverse environments.

Conclusion: GENNAV effectively addresses limitations of existing methods for target region identification, demonstrating strong performance on both benchmark evaluation and real-world deployment across varied urban environments.

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [43] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B is an auto-thinking MLLM that adaptively decides when to use step-by-step thinking based on problem complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs use step-by-step thinking for all problems, which is inefficient for simple problems that don't require complex reasoning.

Method: Uses bi-mode annealing to enable both thinking and non-thinking capabilities, with Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO) to improve decision-making on when to activate thinking. Two-phase training: first on curated dataset with both modes, then under improved GRPO framework.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance across 25 benchmarks, outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks, and matches larger models like Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: R-4B successfully addresses inefficiency in MLLMs by adaptive thinking activation, demonstrating superior performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject is a Mamba-based fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data to detect hidden or obscured objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across challenging multimodal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB-based detection methods fail under adverse conditions like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations, creating a need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches.

Method: A fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism to capture complementary signals across modalities and create unified representations.

Result: State-of-the-art or competitive performance across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets.

Conclusion: Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions, exposing limitations in current unimodal and naive fusion strategies.

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

### [45] [RadGS-Reg: Registering Spine CT with Biplanar X-rays via Joint 3D Radiative Gaussians Reconstruction and 3D/3D Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21154)
*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg is a novel framework for CT/X-ray registration that combines 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction with 3D/3D registration, addressing challenges in accuracy and real-time performance for image-guided navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CT/X-ray registration methods suffer from spatial information loss and domain gaps, while current 3D reconstruction approaches struggle with noisy X-rays and dense-view requirements, creating a need for more robust vertebral-level registration.

Method: The framework uses biplanar X-rays vertebral RadGS reconstruction with Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) to focus on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays, plus patient-specific pre-training to adapt from simulated to real data while learning vertebral shape priors.

Result: Experiments on in-house datasets show state-of-the-art performance for both 3D reconstruction and registration tasks, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods by providing accurate vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration through joint reconstruction and registration, demonstrating superior performance in handling noisy X-rays and real-time requirements.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

*Kevin Mayer,Alex Vesel,Xinyi Zhao,Martin Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D is a large synthetic dataset of 6.2M 3D residential buildings with three modalities: LoD4 wireframe graphs, floor plan images, and LiDAR-like roof point clouds, enabling automated 3D building generation with semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated 3D building datasets for applications in architecture, energy simulation, and navigation by leveraging synthetic data approaches that have proven successful in computer vision.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset of over 6.2 million residential buildings with three modalities: semantically enriched 3D wireframe graphs at LoD4, corresponding floor plan images, and LiDAR-like roof point clouds. Semantic annotations are derived from floor plan images.

Result: A publicly available large-scale dataset (SYNBUILD-3D) that provides multi-modal representations of 3D buildings with semantic annotations including rooms, doors, and windows, enabling development of generative AI algorithms for automated 3D building creation.

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D enables novel generative AI approaches for automating 3D building model creation at high detail levels while maintaining semantic-geometric consistency, addressing a critical gap in 3D building modeling research and applications.

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

### [47] [Radially Distorted Homographies, Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21190)
*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for estimating homographies with radial distortion in three different configurations, providing faster minimal solvers while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homography estimation is crucial in computer vision, but real images often have lens distortions that require simultaneous estimation of both homography and radial distortion for accurate results.

Method: Proposes a novel unified mathematical framework to handle three radial distortion configurations: distortion in one image, identical distortion in both images, and independent distortion in both images. Develops new minimal solvers based on this approach.

Result: The proposed solvers are faster than existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar accuracy. Tested successfully on established benchmarks including fisheye camera images.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive solution for radially distorted homography estimation that outperforms previous methods in speed while preserving accuracy across all three distortion configurations.

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

### [48] [GCAV: A Global Concept Activation Vector Framework for Cross-Layer Consistency in Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21197)
*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCAV unifies Concept Activation Vectors across neural network layers using contrastive learning and attention fusion, reducing inconsistency and improving concept interpretation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CAVs computed independently at different layers often show inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons unreliable for interpreting deep neural networks.

Method: Proposes Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV) framework using contrastive learning to align concept representations across layers and attention-based fusion to create globally integrated CAVs.

Result: Significantly reduces variance in TCAV scores, preserves concept relevance, enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial perturbations across multiple deep neural networks.

Conclusion: GCAV provides a more comprehensive and interpretable understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts by integrating cross-layer information into a coherent framework.

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [49] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP is a novel framework that enables object re-identification models to generalize to unseen categories using in-context examples as prompts, without retraining, by combining LLMs and vision foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ReID methods are domain-specific and require costly labeled data for new categories, while self-supervised learning struggles with identity-sensitive features needed for ReID.

Method: VICP uses LLMs to infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, then guides a vision foundation model (e.g., DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via dynamic visual prompts.

Result: Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks show VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen categories without dataset-specific retraining.

Conclusion: VICP enables effective generalization to novel object categories using in-context prompting, eliminating the need for costly retraining while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

### [50] [Lightweight MRI-Based Automated Segmentation of Pancreatic Cancer with Auto3DSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21227)
*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegResNet models trained for pancreatic tumor segmentation on MRI showed modest performance (DSC 0.56 for Task 1, 0.33 for Task 2), highlighting challenges with small datasets and sequence variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pancreatic tumor delineation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability.

Method: Used SegResNet models within Auto3DSeg architecture with 5-fold cross-validation and STAPLE ensembling on region-of-interest focused MRI data. Evaluated on two tasks: 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI cases (Task 1) and 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases (Task 2).

Result: Task 1 achieved DSC 0.56, 5mm DSC 0.73, HD95 41.1mm, MASD 26.0mm, RMSE 5164mm. Task 2 showed lower performance: DSC 0.33, 5mm DSC 0.50, HD95 20.1mm, MASD 7.2mm, RMSE 17,203mm.

Conclusion: Results demonstrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation with small datasets and highlight variability from different MRI sequences. Shows potential for automated delineation but emphasizes need for larger, standardized datasets to improve clinical utility.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

### [51] [Reverse Imaging for Wide-spectrum Generalization of Cardiac MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21254)
*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging is a physics-driven method that infers underlying spin properties from cardiac MRI images to enable domain adaptation and data augmentation, solving generalization problems across different imaging sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained segmentation models struggle with generalization across different cardiac MRI sequences due to significant variations in image contrast caused by different imaging protocols, despite being governed by the same fundamental spin properties.

Method: The method involves reversely inferring underlying spin properties (proton density, T1, T2 values) from observed MRI images by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems regularized by a spin prior distribution learned from mSASHA dataset using a generative diffusion model.

Result: The approach enables approximate but meaningful spin-property estimates that serve as interpretable latent variables, allowing highly flexible image synthesis of arbitrary novel sequences and achieving highly accurate segmentation across vastly different image contrasts.

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging fundamentally solves the generalization problem in cardiac MRI segmentation by providing wide-spectrum generalization across different imaging protocols through physics-driven domain adaptation and data augmentation.

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

### [52] [PHD: Personalized 3D Human Body Fitting with Point Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21257)
*Hsuan-I Ho,Chen Guo,Po-Chen Wu,Ivan Shugurov,Chengcheng Tang,Abhay Mittal,Sizhe An,Manuel Kaufmann,Linguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD is a personalized 3D human mesh recovery method that uses user-specific shape information to improve pose estimation accuracy from videos by decoupling shape calibration and pose fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HMR methods are user-agnostic and optimized for generalization, but they compromise 3D accuracy by not jointly accounting for person-specific body shapes and 3D pose plausibility when refining poses using 2D constraints.

Method: The pipeline first calibrates the user's body shape, then employs a personalized pose fitting process conditioned on that shape using a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer with Point Distillation Sampling loss.

Result: The approach improves both pelvis-aligned pose accuracy and absolute pose accuracy, mitigates errors from over-reliance on 2D constraints, is data-efficient (requires only synthetic data), and serves as a plug-and-play module for existing 3D pose estimators.

Conclusion: PHD provides an effective solution for personalized 3D human mesh recovery by leveraging user-specific shape information and a learned 3D pose prior, offering improved accuracy and versatility compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

### [53] [Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Temporal Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21363)
*Yuquan Bi,Hongsong Wang,Xinli Shi,Zhipeng Gui,Jie Gui,Yuan Yan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient diffusion-based 3D human pose estimation framework with hierarchical temporal pruning that reduces computational costs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate high-fidelity 3D human poses but suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements, making them inefficient for practical applications.

Method: Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy with three components: Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) for frame-level pruning, Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) for attention computation reduction, and Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) for semantic-level pruning via clustering.

Result: Reduces training MACs by 38.5%, inference MACs by 56.8%, and improves inference speed by 81.1% compared to prior diffusion methods while achieving state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HTP framework effectively addresses computational inefficiency in diffusion-based 3D pose estimation through hierarchical pruning, enabling practical deployment without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Qingran Miao,Haixia Wang,Haohao Sun,Yilong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Print2Volume generates realistic synthetic 3D OCT fingerprints from 2D images to overcome data scarcity, achieving significant performance improvement in biometric recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost and time-consuming OCT data acquisition leads to scarce large-scale datasets, hindering development of deep learning models for 3D fingerprint recognition.

Method: Three-stage framework: 2D style transfer, 3D structure expansion network, and OCT realism refiner using 3D GAN to generate authentic synthetic OCT fingerprints.

Result: Generated 420,000 synthetic samples; pre-training on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real data reduced EER from 15.62% to 2.50% on ZJUT-EIFD benchmark.

Conclusion: Print2Volume effectively addresses OCT data scarcity by generating high-quality synthetic data, significantly improving recognition performance and enabling advanced algorithm development.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

*Andreas Leibetseder,Sabrina Kletz,Klaus Schoeffmann,Simon Keckstein,Jörg Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLENDA is the first public image dataset for gynecologic laparoscopy with endometriosis annotations, created to address the lack of training data for computer vision in surgical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of surgical recordings is time-consuming, and computer vision approaches need sample data which is scarce in medical fields, particularly for endometriosis detection.

Method: Created a region-based annotated image dataset through collaboration with medical experts, focusing on endometriosis tissue dislocations in gynecologic laparoscopy videos.

Result: Published GLENDA - the first dataset of its kind containing annotated endometriosis images from gynecologic laparoscopy procedures.

Conclusion: This dataset enables development of sophisticated computer vision and machine learning approaches for automated surgical video analysis, benefiting treatment planning, documentation, and education.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the

*Sabrina Kletz,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Heinrich Husslein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates surgical instrument segmentation and recognition in laparoscopic gynecology videos using region-based fully convolutional networks, achieving high accuracy for binary segmentation but facing challenges in multi-class instrument recognition due to instrument similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recorded surgical videos contain valuable detailed information but lack automatic content indexing for search and analysis. The special nature of medical video content makes automatic indexing challenging, particularly for surgical instrument identification.

Method: Used a region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware segmentation and recognition. Evaluated two tasks: (1) binary instrument segmentation (instrument vs background) and (2) multi-class instrument recognition (identifying specific instrument types).

Result: Achieved high accuracy in localizing and segmenting instrument regions even with a moderately low number of training examples. However, determining specific instrument types proved very challenging due to the high similarity between different surgical instruments.

Conclusion: While surgical instrument segmentation from background is feasible with good accuracy, multi-class instrument recognition remains difficult due to the inherent visual similarity of different surgical instruments, indicating this area requires further research and improved methods.

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage large amounts of unlabeled remote sensing data through self-supervised learning, specifically using contrastive methods like DINO which are less common than masked autoencoders in this domain.

Method: Developed SatDINO, a DINO-based contrastive self-supervised model tailored for satellite imagery. Introduced novel enhancements including ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling techniques.

Result: SatDINO outperforms state-of-the-art MAE-based methods across multiple datasets and testing setups, achieving competitive results in various benchmarks. Rigorous ablation studies validate individual components.

Conclusion: Contrastive self-supervised learning with SatDINO is highly effective for remote sensing imagery representation learning, and the proposed enhancements (GSD encoding, adaptive view sampling) provide significant performance improvements that can be independently applied.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for
pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating 2D index maps and tissue profiling for Whole Slide Images to enable automated content analysis and AI algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of WSIs for AI training is impractical for large collections, and there's no standard metadata format for automated content selection.

Method: Proposes a general framework with 2D index maps and three-layer tissue mapping (source, tissue type, pathological alterations) using common syntax for interoperability.

Result: Enables automated content analysis of WSIs, facilitates ML algorithm development, and provides graph-based WSI representations with detailed tissue classification.

Conclusion: The proposed standard provides a scalable solution for WSI content analysis, enabling efficient AI algorithm development and interoperability across different medical domains.

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICPL enables unsupervised incremental learning using confidence-based pseudo-labels instead of human annotations, achieving competitive results with supervised methods and outperforming class-iNCD methods by 5+% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios require models to learn novel classes incrementally, but existing Class-Incremental Learning methods assume fully labeled datasets which is unrealistic. There's a need for methods that can learn from unlabeled data.

Method: Proposes ICPL method using confidence-based pseudo-labels to replace human annotations. Integrates pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluates on CIFAR100, ImageNet100, and fine-grained datasets.

Result: ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy. Validated on resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised incremental learning approach using confidence-based pseudo-labels effectively addresses the practical challenge of learning from unlabeled datasets while maintaining performance comparable to supervised methods.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedShift is a unified generative model for cross-domain translation between synthetic and real X-ray images, using Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges to bridge domain gaps in medical imaging without requiring paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic medical data has scalability benefits but suffers from domain gaps that limit real-world applicability. The paper addresses the challenge of translating between synthetic and real X-ray images to improve generalizability in clinical settings.

Method: Proposed MedShift, a class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges. It learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports unpaired translation between multiple domains without domain-specific training.

Result: MedShift demonstrates strong performance despite smaller model size compared to diffusion approaches. It offers flexibility at inference, allowing tuning for either perceptual fidelity or structural consistency. The method was benchmarked on X-DigiSkull, a new dataset of aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays.

Conclusion: MedShift provides a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging, enabling high-fidelity translation between synthetic and real medical images without requiring paired data or domain-specific training.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

TL;DR: Deep learning approach for global individual tree detection using 3-m PlanetScope imagery and simulated Gaussian tree crowns trained on airborne lidar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale monitoring of individual trees is limited by inadequate modeling, as existing global products only provide binary tree cover or canopy height without identifying individual trees.

Method: Deep learning model using simulated tree crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, trained on billions of points from airborne lidar data to detect crown centers and generate binary tree cover maps.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with fractional cover R² = 0.81 against aerial lidar, balanced detection metrics across biomes, and improved detection through fine-tuning with manual labels.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring that can identify trees both inside and outside forests, adaptable to future satellite missions.

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

TL;DR: M presents a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient dynamic scene training using hierarchical Gaussian organization, hybrid deformation/spawning strategy, and adaptive masking to reduce computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity real-time rendering but faces limitations with dynamic scenes due to large data volumes and prolonged training times per frame.

Method: Hierarchical organization of Gaussian spheres by scale, hybrid deformation and spawning strategy for motion modeling, and bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism to remove static regions and prioritize informative viewpoints.

Result: Achieves superior visual quality while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: M provides an efficient and scalable solution for dynamic scene rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting, overcoming previous limitations in data volume and training efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 125M-parameter image captioning model achieves performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, but suffers from visual blindness issues. A novel Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework with DeepLens improves visual grounding to address these limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying multimodal large language models on local devices is challenging due to high computational demands. There's a need for lightweight yet effective image captioning models for applications like video instruction systems and exploration robots.

Method: Developed a specialist model based on a 125M-parameter language model (56x smaller than LLaMA-7B). Created Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework with DeepLens component that extracts detailed visual representations by focusing on informative regions identified during initial glance.

Result: The lightweight model achieves performance comparable to large multimodal generalists. The framework effectively addresses visual blindness issues caused by ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations, enhancing caption quality through improved visual grounding.

Conclusion: The proposed specialist model shows strong potential for on-device applications, and the Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework successfully mitigates visual blindness limitations while maintaining the advantages of a small, efficient model.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Result: Classification head architecture substantially influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard federated averaging.

Conclusion: Results provide practical insights for deploying foundation models in decentralized clinical settings and highlight important trade-offs that should guide future federated learning method development for medical applications.

### [65] [Multi-Method Ensemble for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21463)
*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score that combines feature truncation and multiple scoring functions for superior out-of-distribution detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods focus on either feature truncation or scoring functions individually, and evaluate on specific OOD datasets, missing the potential benefits of combining multiple techniques for robust detection.

Method: Theoretically and empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be effectively combined. Proposes MME score that unifies multiple OOD detectors into a single scoring function through aggregation of multiple scoring functions.

Result: MME significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering both near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. Achieves average FPR95 of 27.57% on ImageNet-1K using BiT model, improving by 6% over best baseline.

Conclusion: Combining feature truncation with multiple scoring functions through ensemble methods creates a more robust and effective OOD detection framework that handles various types of OOD samples better than individual approaches.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

*Chun Liu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Localized augmentation method for adversarial patch attacks that only augments target regions to improve attack success rate and transferability by reducing background interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data transformation methods for adversarial attacks often over-augment background and non-target areas, causing false detections unrelated to the adversarial patches themselves. This interference reduces the effectiveness of attacks on ship detection models.

Method: Proposes a localized augmentation approach that applies augmentation only to the target regions (ships), avoiding any influence on non-target areas. This allows the loss function to focus more directly on the impact of adversarial patches.

Result: Experiments on HRSC2016 dataset show the method effectively increases the success rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability compared to traditional augmentation methods.

Conclusion: Localized augmentation targeting only specific regions improves adversarial attack effectiveness by reducing background interference and allowing better focus on the actual adversarial impact, making ship detection models more vulnerable to targeted attacks.

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

*Hao Lu,Jiahao Wang,Yaolun Zhang,Ruohui Wang,Xuanyu Zheng,Yepeng Tang,Dahua Lin,Lewei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELV-Halluc is the first benchmark for long-video hallucination in Video-MLLMs, focusing on Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH) where models generate incorrect outputs despite correct frame-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video hallucination benchmarks focus on short videos and oversimplify hallucination causes. SAH occurs during frame-to-event semantic aggregation and becomes critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity.

Method: Introduces ELV-Halluc benchmark, analyzes SAH patterns, experiments with positional encoding strategies, and uses DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) with 8K adversarial data pairs to enhance semantic distinction.

Result: Confirmed SAH existence showing it increases with semantic complexity. Models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Achieved 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio and improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAH is a distinct hallucination type in long videos that requires specialized mitigation approaches. Positional encoding and DPO strategies effectively reduce SAH, providing new directions for improving Video-MLLM reliability in complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

*Ronan Docherty,Antonis Vamvakeros,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A convolutional neural network is trained to upsample low-resolution foundation model features using input image reference, enabling efficient and high-quality segmentation of microscopy images with minimal labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based foundation models struggle with fine features in micrographs and large image sizes common in materials and biological image analysis, requiring a solution for better feature representation.

Method: Train a CNN to upsample low-resolution foundation model features with reference to the input image, then apply this upsampler network without further training to featurize and segment various microscopy images.

Result: The upsampled features enable separation of hard-to-segment phases like hairline cracks, and interactive segmentation produces high-quality results faster with fewer labels compared to traditional convolutional networks.

Conclusion: The proposed upsampler network effectively enhances foundation model features for microscopy image analysis, achieving superior segmentation performance with reduced computational and labeling requirements.

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in drone scenarios with wide field of view and complex compositional semantics, where mainstream VLMs lack fine-grained semantics and hierarchical methods have rigid constraints.

Method: Proposes HCCM framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC) for hierarchical semantics without precise partitioning, (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM) for local semantic consistency evaluation. Includes Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) for robustness against incomplete text descriptions.

Conclusion: HCCM effectively addresses drone vision-language challenges through flexible hierarchical learning and robust alignment mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

### [70] [Complete Gaussian Splats from a Single Image with Denoising Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21542)
*Ziwei Liao,Mohamed Sayed,Steven L. Waslander,Sara Vicente,Daniyar Turmukhambetov,Michael Firman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative method using latent diffusion to reconstruct complete 3D scenes with Gaussian splats from single images, addressing occlusion and unobserved areas with diverse plausible completions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian splatting requires dense observations and fails at occluded areas, while regression-based methods produce blurry single-mode predictions that don't capture multiple plausible solutions for unseen surfaces.

Method: Proposes a generative formulation with a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space from 2D images self-supervised, then trains a diffusion model over this latent space to generate diverse 3D Gaussian splat representations conditioned on single input images.

Result: The method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples that complete occluded surfaces, enabling high-quality 360-degree renderings from single images.

Conclusion: The generative approach successfully addresses the ambiguity of occluded surface reconstruction, producing complete and plausible 3D scenes from minimal input while capturing multiple possible explanations for unseen areas.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

### [71] [EZ-Sort: Efficient Pairwise Comparison via Zero-Shot CLIP-Based Pre-Ordering and Human-in-the-Loop Sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21550)
*Yujin Park,Haejun Chung,Ikbeom Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EZ-Sort reduces pairwise comparison annotation costs by 90.5% vs exhaustive methods and 19.8% vs prior work using CLIP-based pre-ordering and automated comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise comparisons are more reliable than absolute ratings but require O(n²) annotations, making them impractical for large datasets. Recent work reduced this to O(n log n), but further efficiency improvements are needed.

Method: Uses CLIP model for zero-shot hierarchical pre-ordering, initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and runs uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort to replace obvious comparisons with automated ones.

Result: Achieved 90.5% reduction in human annotations compared to exhaustive methods and 19.8% reduction compared to prior work (n=100), while maintaining or improving inter-rater reliability across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling provides an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking tasks with significantly reduced annotation burden.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

*Ilya A. Petrov,Vladimir Guzov,Riccardo Marin,Emre Aksan,Xu Chen,Daniel Cremers,Thabo Beeler,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECHO is a unified framework that recovers human pose, object motion, and contact from minimal egocentric head and wrist tracking using a Diffusion Transformer and three-variate diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling human-object interactions from egocentric perspective is important for wearable devices but largely unexplored, with limited research on recovering interaction information from minimal tracking data.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformer architecture with three-variate diffusion process to jointly model human motion, object trajectory, and contact sequence. Operates in head-centric canonical space and employs conveyor-based inference for sequences of any length.

Result: ECHO outperforms existing methods in egocentric HOI reconstruction, setting state-of-the-art performance while offering greater flexibility in input configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed ECHO framework successfully demonstrates that comprehensive human-object interaction information can be recovered from minimal egocentric tracking data, providing a unified solution for wearable device applications.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

*Juneyoung Ro,Namwoo Kim,Yoonjin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs perform reasonably on urban spatial reasoning in zero-shot but fine-tuning with synthetic CoT-supervised data significantly improves performance, especially for challenging question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well current vision-language models transfer spatial reasoning abilities to urban scenes and explore domain adaptation methods.

Method: Comparative study of BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5 with zero-shot evaluation and fine-tuning using synthetic VQA dataset constructed from street-view image predictions with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought answers.

Result: Fine-tuning with synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance over zero-shot, particularly for challenging question types like negation and counterfactuals.

Conclusion: Urban spatial reasoning presents a new challenge for VLMs, and synthetic dataset construction is an effective approach for adapting general models to specialized domains.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

*Nico Albert Disch,Yannick Kirchhoff,Robin Peretzke,Maximilian Rokuss,Saikat Roy,Constantin Ulrich,David Zimmerer,Klaus Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TFM is a unified generative method for 4D medical image prediction that learns temporal distributions, supports 3D volumes and irregular sampling, and outperforms existing spatio-temporal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for medical imaging either focus on single temporal contexts or are limited to classification/regression tasks, lacking fine-grained spatial prediction capabilities for temporal dynamics in disease progression and anatomical development.

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) - a generative trajectory method that learns underlying temporal distributions, can fall back to nearest image prediction, and supports 3D volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular temporal sampling.

Result: TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging across three public longitudinal datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for 4D medical image prediction.

Conclusion: TFM provides a robust baseline and unified framework for temporal medical image analysis, addressing the fundamental gap in fine-grained spatial predictions for disease progression modeling and anatomical development tracking.

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning framework combining CT scans and pathology images improves recurrence prediction in kidney cancer, with pathology being more prognostic than imaging alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Leibovich score for ccRCC recurrence risk has limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information, needing better personalized prediction methods.

Method: Modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox survival modeling, testing unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion approaches using CT and whole-slide pathology images.

Result: WSI-based models outperformed CT-only models, intermediate fusion further improved performance, best model approached adjusted Leibovich score performance, radiology added value primarily through fusion.

Conclusion: Foundation model-based multimodal integration is feasible for personalized ccRCC risk prediction, with future work needed on better fusion strategies, larger datasets, and improved CT encoders.

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep unfolding network for computer-generated holography that combines adaptive bandwidth-preserving model and phase-domain complex-valued denoiser to overcome limitations of existing methods, achieving over 35 dB PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based CGH methods have three main limitations: end-to-end networks ignore physical relationships and reduce interpretability, CNN-based methods have limited receptive fields, and ASM-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.

Method: Proposes a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into two modules: adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) for wider working distances and phase-domain complex-valued denoiser (PCD) with complex-valued deformable self-attention to capture global features.

Result: Achieves PSNR over 35 dB and shows state-of-the-art results on both simulated and real data, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DUN framework provides more flexibility, interpretability, and better performance than traditional end-to-end networks and ASM-based methods, successfully addressing the key challenges in computer-generated holography.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: Interactive PET/CT lesion segmentation using promptable nnU-Net with Euclidean Distance Transform encoding of user clicks, achieving improved accuracy through ensemble models and online interaction simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for human-in-the-loop refinement in oncological PET/CT segmentation to handle tracer heterogeneity, physiological uptake, and multi-center variability while maintaining clinical workflow efficiency.

Method: Extended nnU-Net framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided foreground/background clicks as additional input channels using Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), with online simulation of user interactions and custom point sampling strategy.

Result: EDT-based ensemble models achieved strongest cross-validation performance, reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models, demonstrating superior performance over Gaussian kernel encodings.

Conclusion: Promptable models with EDT encoding enable efficient user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT, with publicly available code for implementation.

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

TL;DR: A novel probabilistic projection mechanism for HD map construction that uses geometric mapping with confidence scores to improve accuracy and filter out hallucinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HD mapping approaches struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems and often hallucinate non-existent road elements when using standard attention-based projection techniques.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores that starts with geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapts it to the scene, while using confidence scores for temporal processing and filtering irrelevant elements.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets show improved performance over state-of-the-art approaches, with particularly pronounced improvements on nuScenes and in challenging long perception ranges.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates better generalization and accuracy in HD map construction by combining geometric mapping with adaptive probabilistic projection and confidence-based filtering.

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes line-level OCR to overcome word segmentation bottlenecks, achieving 5.4% accuracy improvement and 4x efficiency gain compared to word-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Word-level OCR moved the accuracy bottleneck from character segmentation to word segmentation, limiting context for language models and causing errors in word detection.

Method: Transition from word-level to line-level OCR, bypassing word segmentation errors and providing larger sentence context for better language model utilization. Created a new dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations for training and benchmarking.

Result: Achieved 5.4% end-to-end accuracy improvement and 4 times efficiency improvement compared to word-based OCR pipelines.

Conclusion: Line-level OCR is a natural progression that improves both accuracy and efficiency, with potential to leverage advances in large language models for document image processing.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: FLORA is a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline that uses LoRA fine-tuning of Flux 1.1 diffusion model to create high-quality synthetic images for object detection with minimal computational resources, achieving better performance than baseline methods using only 10% of the data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large diffusion models for synthetic data generation, which requires enterprise-grade GPUs and thousands of synthetic images, making it impractical for many real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model fine-tuned exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), dramatically reducing computational requirements to consumer-grade GPU levels (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090).

Result: Training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images from FLORA yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on 5000 synthetic images from ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to 21.3% in mAP@.50:.95.

Conclusion: FLORA demonstrates that quality and efficiency-focused approach is more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios while surpassing state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Adversarial perturbations create detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations, enabling 90% detection accuracy without model modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks but existing detection methods require expensive retraining, architecture changes, or degrade clean input performance.

Method: Parallel entropy monitoring on CNN activations (VGG-16) to detect entropy shifts caused by adversarial perturbations without modifying the model.

Result: Adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, achieving 90% detection accuracy with false positive/negative rates below 20%. Complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy distributions.

Conclusion: CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in activation patterns, enabling reliable adversarial detection through activation entropy monitoring without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

TL;DR: CAD2DMD-SET is a synthetic data generation tool that creates VQA-labeled datasets for improving LVLMs' ability to read digital measurement devices in challenging real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with reading values from digital measurement devices (DMDs) in real-world scenarios with clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur, which are common in head-mounted cameras and AR applications.

Method: Leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition to generate diverse synthetic DMD datasets. Also created DMDBench, a 1,000-image real-world validation set. Fine-tuned LVLMs using LoRA with the synthetic data.

Result: Substantial improvements in model performance, with InternVL showing a 200% score increase using Average Normalised Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) metric, without degrading performance on other tasks.

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET significantly improves LVLM robustness and performance in challenging DMD reading scenarios. The tool will be released as open-source to enable community use and extension.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the

*Xavier Juanola,Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes,Gloria Haro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SSL-SaN, a self-supervised sound localization model that handles negative audio cases (silence, noise, offscreen sounds) with improved training strategy, new evaluation metric, and extended dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods perform poorly with low audio-visual semantic correspondence (silence, noise, offscreen sounds) and evaluations are limited to positive cases with single visible sound sources.

Method: Proposed training strategy incorporating silence and noise, self-supervised SSL-SaN model, new metric for alignment-separability trade-off, and extended IS3+ dataset with negative audio.

Result: SSL-SaN achieves state-of-the-art performance in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval, with improved robustness against negative sounds.

Conclusion: The approach addresses limitations of current methods by handling negative audio cases and provides comprehensive evaluation framework with new metrics and dataset.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UItron is an open-source foundational model for GUI agents that addresses challenges in GUI automation through advanced data engineering, interactive infrastructure, and a curriculum reinforcement learning framework, achieving superior performance particularly in Chinese mobile app scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building GUI agents remains challenging due to scarcity of operation trajectories, lack of interactive infrastructure, and limitations in foundation models' initial capabilities. The work aims to advance GUI agent development for automated operations on mobile/PC devices.

Method: Systematic data engineering strategies, establishment of interactive environment connecting mobile/PC devices, supervised finetuning over perception and planning tasks, and curriculum reinforcement learning framework for complex reasoning and exploration.

Result: UItron achieves superior performance in GUI perception, grounding, and planning benchmarks. It demonstrates significant progress in Chinese app scenarios with over one million manually collected operation trajectories across top 100 popular apps.

Conclusion: UItron propels GUI agents closer to real-world applications by addressing key challenges through systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure, particularly advancing capabilities in Chinese mobile app environments.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

### [85] [Domain Generalization in-the-Wild: Disentangling Classification from Domain-Aware Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21769)
*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's domain generalization evaluation is flawed due to web-scale pretraining data covering benchmarks. Proposed CLIP-DCA enhances domain awareness while ensuring domain-invariant classification, showing significant improvements on out-of-distribution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current domain generalization evaluation for foundation models like CLIP is inadequate because web-scale pretraining data may already cover benchmark datasets, making the evaluation neither challenging enough nor truly testing unseen data scenarios.

Method: CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations) identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data, while simultaneously encouraging domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from domain features.

Result: CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more out-of-distribution datasets. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: Enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models, and CLIP-DCA successfully addresses CLIP's performance degradation on challenging out-of-distribution datasets through its disentangled approach.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

### [86] [What Can We Learn from Harry Potter? An Exploratory Study of Visual Representation Learning from Atypical Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21770)
*Qiyue Sun,Qiming Huang,Yang Yang,Hongjun Wang,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Atypical videos (sci-fi, animation, etc.) improve open-world learning performance in OOD detection, novel category discovery, and zero-shot action recognition when used in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at generalizing from uncommon concepts, but most video studies focus on typical closed-set data. This paper explores how atypical unusual videos can benefit open-world learning.

Method: Collected a new video dataset of unusual atypical data (sci-fi, animation) and fed them into model training for representation learning. Evaluated on three open-world tasks: OOD detection, novel category discovery, and zero-shot action recognition.

Result: Even straightforward learning with atypical data consistently improves performance across all three tasks. Categorical diversity boosts OOD detection, semantic diversity helps novel category discovery, and atypical videos aid zero-shot generalization to unseen actions.

Conclusion: Atypical videos provide significant benefits for visual representation learning in open-world scenarios, with diversity being more important than quantity. The findings encourage further research in this direction.

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

### [87] [Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773)
*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL) using Kernel Density Estimation of deep video features with novelty detection for dynamic memory expansion, achieving strong performance on video action recognition datasets without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in unsupervised video continual learning where prior work focused only on supervised settings with labeled data and task boundaries, which are costly and impractical for real-world video applications.

Method: Uses Kernel Density Estimation of deep embedded video features from unsupervised video transformers as non-parametric probabilistic representations. Introduces novelty detection for incoming tasks to dynamically expand memory clusters and leverages transfer learning from previous tasks.

Result: Substantially enhances performance when successively learning many tasks, validated on three standard video action recognition datasets (UCF101, HMDB51, Something-to-Something V2) without using labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: The proposed uVCL framework effectively handles the challenges of unsupervised video continual learning through non-parametric representations and dynamic memory management, demonstrating strong performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

*Omer Faruk Durugol,Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep multi-stage cascaded nnU-Net approach with metric-aware ensembling achieves state-of-the-art PDAC segmentation from MRI, addressing data scarcity and poor contrast challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated PDAC segmentation from MRI is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast and limited annotated data, which the PANTHER challenge aims to address for both diagnostic T1-weighted and therapeutic T2-weighted segmentation tasks.

Method: Built on nnU-Net framework with deep multi-stage cascaded pre-training strategy, starting from general anatomical foundation model and sequentially fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and target MRI modalities. Used five-fold cross-validation to evaluate data augmentation schemes and training schedules, then constructed custom heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models with metric-aware ensembling.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art boundary precision with MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1. Top cross-validation Tumor Dice scores of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523 for Task 2. Found trade-off where aggressive augmentation gives best volumetric accuracy while default augmentations yield superior boundary precision.

Conclusion: Presents a robust methodology for developing specialized high-performance models in limited data scenarios, demonstrating effective metric-aware ensembling strategy that addresses complex medical imaging challenges in PDAC segmentation.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5 demonstrates superior performance over previous models in radiation oncology benchmarks, achieving 92.8% accuracy on multiple-choice exams and generating clinically sound treatment recommendations with rare hallucinations, though expert oversight remains essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-5's performance in clinical decision support for radiation oncology, specifically assessing its capabilities in multiple-choice examinations and real-world treatment recommendation generation compared to previous GPT models.

Method: Used two benchmarks: 1) ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (300 multiple-choice items), and 2) 60 authentic radiation oncology vignettes rated by four board-certified radiation oncologists for correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations using Fleiss' kappa for reliability.

Result: GPT-5 achieved 92.8% accuracy on TXIT benchmark, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Vignette evaluation showed high correctness (3.24/4) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4) ratings with rare hallucinations. Errors occurred mainly in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge.

Conclusion: GPT-5 significantly outperforms previous models in radiation oncology but still requires rigorous expert oversight due to occasional substantive errors, particularly in complex clinical scenarios requiring detailed adaptation.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

### [90] [TMUAD: Enhancing Logical Capabilities in Unified Anomaly Detection Models with a Text Memory Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21795)
*Jiawei Liu,Jiahe Hou,Wei Wang,Jinsong Du,Yang Cong,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMUAD proposes a three-memory framework using text, object-level, and patch-level memory banks to unify structural and logical anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across industrial and medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is challenging due to limited normal data. Existing methods rely on image feature extractors and memory banks but lack effective handling of logical anomalies that deviate from normal patterns.

Method: Three complementary memory banks: 1) class-level text memory bank with logic-aware text extractor for logical anomalies, 2) object-level image memory bank preserving complete object contours, 3) patch-level memory bank for structural anomalies. Features are retrieved, compared, and fused into final anomaly scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains.

Conclusion: The unified approach through collaborative memory banks effectively handles both structural and logical anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance in diverse application domains.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

TL;DR: VoCap is a video model that takes video and multimodal prompts to produce object masks and captions, achieving SOTA results on video segmentation tasks using pseudo-caption annotations from SAV dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental need for fine-grained video object understanding with simultaneous segmentation and captioning capabilities, overcoming data annotation challenges.

Method: Proposes VoCap model that processes videos with text/box/mask prompts to generate spatio-temporal masks and object-centric captions. Uses pseudo-caption annotations by preprocessing SAV dataset with ground-truth masks and VLMs, creating SAV-Caption dataset.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on referring expression video object segmentation, competitive on semi-supervised VOS, and establishes video object captioning benchmark.

Conclusion: VoCap provides a flexible solution for multimodal video object understanding, with the SAV-Caption dataset enabling large-scale training and evaluation.

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

*Yiming Lin,Yuchen Niu,Shang Wang,Kaizhu Huang,Qiufeng Wang,Xiao-Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reveals that verb classification in scene recognition is inherently a multi-label problem due to semantic ambiguity, proposes a single positive multi-label learning approach, and introduces GE-VerbMLP with graph networks and adversarial training, achieving 3%+ MAP improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat verb classification as single-label, but this fails to address inherent ambiguity where multiple verb categories can reasonably describe the same image due to semantic overlap between categories.

Method: Proposes reformulating verb classification as single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) and develops Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP) that combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves more than 3% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: Verb classification in scene recognition should be treated as a multi-label problem, and the proposed SPMLL framework with GE-VerbMLP effectively addresses the challenges of semantic ambiguity and incomplete annotations.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveQA is a comprehensive benchmark for testing LLMs and MLLMs on driving knowledge, covering traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way scenarios. It reveals model weaknesses in numerical reasoning and complex scenarios while showing that fine-tuning improves performance on real-world driving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving benchmarks focus on spatial and visual QA but lack comprehensive testing of traffic rule understanding and edge cases that human drivers must master to pass driving tests.

Method: Created DriveQA benchmark with extensive text and vision-based scenarios covering traffic regulations. Conducted experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and MLLMs, performed fine-tuning, and tested model sensitivity to environmental variations through DriveQA-V.

Result: LLMs/MLLMs perform well on basic traffic rules but struggle with numerical reasoning, complex right-of-way scenarios, sign variations, and spatial layouts. Fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection decisions.

Conclusion: DriveQA effectively identifies model weaknesses in driving knowledge and demonstrates that pretraining on this benchmark enhances downstream driving task performance on real-world datasets like nuScenes and BDD, showing models can generalize traffic knowledge effectively.

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual database normalization is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring automation to preserve data integrity without human effort.

Method: Uses dual-model self-refinement architecture combining generation and verification modules with task-specific zero-shot prompts for high accuracy and cost efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show Miffie can normalize complex database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Miffie successfully automates database normalization using LLMs, achieving high accuracy without human intervention through its dual-model refinement approach.

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: To evaluate if LLMs are ready for unsupervised use as tutoring aids in undergraduate science education, particularly in thermodynamics which requires consistent, principle-grounded reasoning.

Method: Created UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics benchmark covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and diagram interpretation, tested on leading 2025-era LLMs.

Result: No model exceeded 95% competence threshold (best achieved 82%). Text-only items performed better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance levels. Performance showed little correlation with prompt phrasing or syntactic complexity.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised thermodynamics tutoring due to significant gaps in handling irreversible scenarios and binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in
science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate
instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent
recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics,
with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions,
reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such
capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics
question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and
diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence
threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items
performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance
levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little
correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible
scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating
that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this
domain.

### [96] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Architectural scaffolds with symbolic reasoning and short-term memory improve LLM performance in Socratic tutoring, outperforming baseline variants and enhancing cognitive behaviors like abstraction and adaptive probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models in instructional dialogue, specifically examining how different architectural components affect structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring.

Method: Introduced symbolic scaffolding mechanism with short-term memory schema, conducted controlled ablation across five system variants, and evaluated using expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory with LLM-based evaluation framework.

Result: Full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity.

Conclusion: Architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs, supporting a processing-level account of how structural components influence cognitive behaviors in instructional dialogue.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

### [97] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM is a comprehensive benchmark for audio-language models that standardizes evaluation across 10 important aspects including perception, reasoning, fairness, and safety, using aggregated datasets and standardized prompts to enable equitable model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ALM evaluations lack standardized benchmarks, measure limited capabilities, and omit critical aspects like fairness and safety, making cross-model comparisons difficult due to inconsistent prompting and inference parameters.

Method: Introduces AHELM benchmark aggregating various datasets including 2 new synthetic ones (PARADE for stereotype avoidance, CoRe-Bench for conversational reasoning), with standardized prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics across 10 evaluation aspects.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro ranked top in 5/10 aspects but showed group unfairness (p=0.01) on ASR tasks, while baseline systems performed surprisingly well with one ranking 5th overall despite only speech-to-text capabilities.

Conclusion: AHELM provides a holistic, standardized evaluation framework for ALMs, revealing performance gaps in fairness and demonstrating that simple baselines can compete with complex models, with plans for ongoing updates as a living benchmark.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,En-Jui Kuo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum text generation models show competitive performance in specific scenarios but traditional Transformers maintain overall superiority in comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language processing by systematically evaluating quantum text generation models against traditional architectures.

Method: Conducted systematic experiments comparing five models (Transformer baseline, QKSAN, QRWKV, QASA) across five diverse datasets using multiple metrics including perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency measures.

Result: Traditional Transformers achieved lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest BLEU-1 score (0.2895). Quantum models showed competitive performance: QKSAN achieved BLEU-1 of 0.2800 with zero repetition rates, QRWKV demonstrated perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

Conclusion: While traditional Transformer models maintain overall superiority, quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive performance in specific scenarios and show promising characteristics like zero repetition and perfect vocabulary diversity.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

### [99] [Normalisation of SWIFT Message Counterparties with Feature Extraction and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21081)
*Thanasis Schoinas,Benjamin Guinard,Diba Esbati,Richard Chalk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based methods for clustering transaction counterparties in banking systems, outperforming traditional fuzzy matching and keyword-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language models are unsuitable for clustering transaction counterparties in banking systems (like SWIFT) due to lack of sentence structure and presence of manual entry variations/noise, creating a gap in fraud investigation tools.

Method: Proposed a hybrid pipeline combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based techniques that can handle unknown number of clusters, with custom metrics based on precision and recall for evaluation.

Result: Testing on real-life labeled dataset showed significantly improved performance over baseline rule-based (keyword) approach, while maintaining interpretability and reducing manual review needs.

Conclusion: The approach provides better risk control for missing entity variations in sanctions investigations and enhances payment flow analysis capabilities for fraud professionals.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

*Haoze Wu,Cheng Wang,Wenshuo Zhao,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterintuitive RL phenomena in LLMs only work when models already have strong task alignment; standard RL remains robust across all settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RL advances in LLMs show surprising phenomena like single-example learning and negative-only training, but it's unclear when these actually work versus when they fail.

Method: Systematic examination of counterintuitive claims through rigorous experiments across different model architectures and task domains, measuring Model-Task Alignment via pass@k accuracy.

Result: Counterintuitive results only occur when models already exhibit strong model-task alignment. These techniques fail in challenging regimes where standard RL methods remain effective.

Conclusion: Model-Task Alignment is the key factor determining when counterintuitive RL phenomena work. Standard RL training is consistently robust, while novel techniques only succeed in already-aligned scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

*Israel Abebe Azime,Deborah D. Kanubala,Tejumade Afonja,Mario Fritz,Isabel Valera,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with tabular data fairness in loan approvals. Serialization format choice significantly impacts both performance and fairness, with some formats improving F1 scores but worsening fairness disparities. ICL boosts performance but has inconsistent fairness effects across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes decision-making like loan approvals, but they struggle with tabular data processing, fairness, and reliable predictions, requiring assessment of their performance and fairness across different regions.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from Ghana, Germany, and the US, focusing on zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities with different serialization formats (GReat, LIFT, etc.)

Result: Serialization format significantly affects both performance and fairness - certain formats yield higher F1 scores but exacerbate fairness disparities. ICL improved performance by 4.9-59.6% over zero-shot but had varying fairness effects across datasets.

Conclusion: Effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware models are crucial for improving LLM reliability in financial decision-making, as format choices significantly impact both performance and fairness outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

TL;DR: InsightTab is a framework that distills tabular data into actionable insights using LLMs, improving few-shot classification performance through principles inspired by human learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in few-shot tabular classification with LLMs due to variability in structured data by distilling data into insights that help LLMs better align general knowledge with specific tabular tasks.

Method: InsightTab framework uses divide-and-conquer, easy-first, and reflective learning principles. It integrates rule summarization, strategic exemplification, and insight reflection through collaboration between LLMs and data modeling techniques.

Result: Extensive evaluation on nine datasets shows consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies validate the principle-guided distillation process, and analyses confirm effectiveness in leveraging labeled data and managing bias.

Conclusion: The insight distillation approach enables robust and effective few-shot tabular classification by helping LLMs better understand and adapt to specific tabular data requirements through actionable insights.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActSub: A novel OOD detection method using SVD to decompose model activations into decisive and insignificant components, achieving state-of-the-art performance by leveraging different subspaces for Near-OOD and Far-OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability of deep models in real-world applications by developing better out-of-distribution detection methods that can handle both large (Far-OOD) and small (Near-OOD) distribution shifts.

Method: Uses singular value decomposition of the classification head weight matrix to decompose model activations into decisive components (maximally contributing to classifier output) and insignificant components (minimally contributing). Combines both subspaces: insignificant subspace for Far-OOD detection and decisive subspace for Near-OOD detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in various standard OOD benchmarks. The insignificant subspace more effectively distinguishes ID from OOD data in Far-OOD regimes, while activation shaping methods benefit from decisive subspace in Near-OOD regimes.

Conclusion: ActSub provides an effective approach for OOD detection by leveraging task-agnostic features from insignificant subspace and task-specific features from decisive subspace, demonstrating superior performance across different distribution shift scenarios.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed framework handles heart rate prediction data heterogeneity through random feature dropout for source diversity and time-aware attention with contrastive learning for user differences, achieving 17-15% performance gains on new benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heart rate prediction faces real-world deployment challenges from data heterogeneity in two dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities.

Method: Framework learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneities using random feature dropout strategy for source heterogeneity, and time-aware attention module with contrastive learning objective for user heterogeneity to build discriminative representation space.

Result: Evaluations on new ParroTao benchmark dataset and public FitRec dataset show model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15% respectively. Learned representations demonstrate strong discriminative power.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses both source and user heterogeneity in heart rate prediction, enabling consistent performance under heterogeneous data patterns with practical value demonstrated through downstream applications.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

Motivation: Unregistered surface meshes and raw 3D scans pose challenges for automatic deformation computation due to lack of point-wise correspondences and noise in data.

Method: Couples a robust motion embedding network with learned per-vertex feature field to generate spatio-temporal deformation field that drives mesh deformation.

Result: Extensive evaluations including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals demonstrate effectiveness on challenging tasks like walking and running.

Conclusion: The approach shows effectiveness and versatility in handling challenging unregistered meshes for motion prediction and transfer tasks.

*Jeong Uk Lee,Sung Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Improved 3D mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussian Splatting using two regularization strategies: effective rank regularization for better Gaussian shapes and neural SDF integration for surface coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SuGaR have limitations in visual fidelity and scene consistency when reconstructing 3D meshes from 3D Gaussian Splatting data.

Method: Two complementary regularization strategies: 1) Effective rank regularization to prevent extreme anisotropy and favor disk-like Gaussian shapes, 2) Integration of neural Signed Distance Function with Eikonal loss for continuous global surface prior.

Result: The model achieves more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data with improved fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and better collective surface behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization techniques significantly enhance 3D mesh reconstruction quality from 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing both individual Gaussian shape optimization and overall surface coherence.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems, finding that recommendations highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no established scientific understanding of the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems, as prior work used different evaluation measures that don't allow proper comparison between the two fairness types.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures that can be used for both fairness types, running 8 experiments across 3 datasets to analyze the relationship between group and individual fairness.

Result: Experiments show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals, revealing a novel tension between these two fairness types.

Conclusion: This finding is novel and useful for recommender system practitioners aiming to improve fairness, as it demonstrates that optimizing for one type of fairness may negatively impact the other.

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

Motivation: To address vision-guided quadruped motion control by combining proprioception with vision for robust control, recognizing that current methods may lack the structured function class needed for smooth gait patterns.

Method: Proposes QuadKAN framework with spline-encoder for proprioception and spline fusion head for cross-modal inputs, using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Trained end-to-end with PPO and Multi-Modal Delay Randomization.

Result: Achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions across diverse terrains (even/uneven surfaces, static/dynamic obstacles) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Spline-parameterized policies provide a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion, demonstrating the value of structured function classes aligned with gait characteristics.

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes 3D CNNs for autonomous driving in mini cars using RGB-D data, showing better performance than RNNs in simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in autonomous driving development like complexity, training time, and uncertainty using mini autonomous cars as cost-effective testbeds.

Method: Uses RGB-D information and 3D convolutional neural networks, compared against recurrent neural networks on simulated tracks with different environmental features.

Result: 3D CNN showed promising results with better task completion success, lap-time metrics, and driving consistency compared to RNNs.

Conclusion: Architectural modifications and track complexity significantly influence model generalization and vehicle control performance, with 3D CNNs being effective for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: We present a multi-modal dataset collected in a soybean crop field,
comprising over two hours of recorded data from sensors such as stereo infrared
camera, color camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GNSS (Single
Point Positioning, Real-Time Kinematic and Post-Processed Kinematic), and wheel
odometry. This dataset captures key challenges inherent to robotics in
agricultural environments, including variations in natural lighting, motion
blur, rough terrain, and long, perceptually aliased sequences. By addressing
these complexities, the dataset aims to support the development and

### [112] [Designing Smarter Conversational Agents for Kids: Lessons from Cognitive Work and Means-Ends Analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21209)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Brazilian children use conversational agents for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment. Structured scaffolds (conversation-tree recipes) improve interactions compared to unstructured approaches, showing gains in readability, question quality, and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Brazilian children use conversational agents and develop structured scaffolds to enhance their interactions for educational and entertainment purposes.

Method: Two studies: Study 1 used interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis with 23 participants over 7 weeks. Study 2 tested structured-prompting recipes on GPT-4o-mini using 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges, comparing against an unstructured baseline.

Result: Identified three CA functions (School, Discovery, Entertainment) and developed recipe scaffolds. Quantitative evaluation showed structured-prompting approach improved readability, question count/depth/diversity, and coherence compared to unstructured baseline.

Conclusion: Proposed design recommendations include scaffolded conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles, and caregiver-curated content. Contributions include first CWA application with Brazilian children, empirical framework of child-CA information flows, and effective LLM-scaffolding recipes.

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

### [113] [Morae: Proactively Pausing UI Agents for User Choices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21456)
*Yi-Hao Peng,Dingzeyu Li,Jeffrey P. Bigham,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae is a UI agent that pauses at decision points to involve BLV users in choices, improving task completion and preference matching compared to end-to-end automation agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI agents perform tasks end-to-end without user involvement, reducing agency for blind and low-vision users who need to make critical choices about products and options.

Method: Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries with UI code and screenshots, automatically identifying decision points and pausing to prompt users for clarification when choices need to be made.

Result: In real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences compared to baseline agents like OpenAI Operator.

Conclusion: Morae exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach that balances automation with user agency, allowing BLV users to benefit from UI assistance while maintaining control over preference-based decisions.

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

### [114] [From Drone Imagery to Livability Mapping: AI-powered Environment Perception in Rural China](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21738)
*Weihuan Deng,Yaofu Huang,Luan Chen,Xun Li,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: A novel drone imagery and MLLM-based framework for assessing rural livability across China, revealing a dual-core spatial pattern and identifying government spending as the key determinant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rural livability assessment methods are limited - questionnaires don't scale well and urban-oriented visual methods are unsuitable for rural contexts. There's a need for scalable, rural-specific assessment approaches to support poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategies.

Method: Used drone imagery from 1,766 villages across 146 Chinese counties. Developed an efficient image comparison mechanism with binary search interpolation. Built a chain-of-thought prompting framework based on expert knowledge to assess living quality and ecological habitability dimensions using multimodal large language models.

Result: Identified a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern with Sichuan and Zhejiang as centers and declining gradients outward. Government fiscal expenditure was the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to 3.9-4.9 unit livability enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable and reliable method for nationwide rural livability assessment. The findings offer valuable insights for rural construction policy-making, particularly highlighting the critical role of government investment in improving rural living conditions.

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.
