TL;DR: Analysis of why teaching LLM failure patterns to users hasn't reduced overreliance, finding that failure patterns exist but automated discovery methods are unreliable, and proposing a better metric for teaching effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People overrely on LLMs because they see impressive capabilities and assume LLMs won't fail on basic tasks. Previous attempts to teach users about failure patterns haven't worked, and this paper aims to understand why.

Method: 1) Examined whether failure patterns exist by grouping instances by meta-labels and evaluating LLM performance; 2) Tested prompting and embedding-based approaches for surfacing known failures; 3) Proposed a new metric to assess users' ability to anticipate LLM failures; 4) Conducted user study with the new metric.

Result: 1) Failure patterns do exist (sizable meta-label groups where LLMs are error-prone); 2) Automated failure discovery methods (prompting and embeddings) show mixed results; 3) User study shows positive effect from teaching when using the proposed anticipation metric, unlike traditional human-AI team accuracy metric.

Conclusion: Teaching failure patterns could mitigate overreliance, but success requires better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics that measure users' ability to anticipate failures rather than just team accuracy.

Abstract: People use large language models (LLMs) when they should not. This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.
  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours.

### [2] [Morality is Contextual: Learning Interpretable Moral Contexts from Human Data with Probabilistic Clustering and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21439)
*Geoffroy Morlat,Marceau Nahon,Augustin Chartouny,Raja Chatila,Ismael T. Freire,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMETH framework integrates probabilistic context learning with LLMs and human moral judgments to model how context shapes acceptability of ambiguous actions, achieving ~60% alignment with human judgments vs ~30% for end-to-end LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moral judgments depend heavily on context, not just outcomes. Current LLMs struggle with context-sensitive moral reasoning and lack interpretability. Need for empirically grounded, interpretable models that capture how context shapes moral evaluation.

Method: 1) Curated dataset of 300 scenarios across 6 core actions with human ternary judgments; 2) Preprocessing pipeline with LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings + K-means for core-action clustering; 3) Online clustering of scenarios from human judgment distributions using divergence criteria; 4) Generalization module extracts binary contextual features and learns feature weights in transparent likelihood model.

Result: COMETH achieves ~60% alignment with majority human judgments, roughly doubling the performance of end-to-end LLM prompting (~30%). Framework reveals which contextual features drive predictions and provides interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: COMETH provides an interpretable, empirically grounded alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction. Combines human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics for reproducible, explainable moral reasoning.

Abstract: Moral actions are judged not only by their outcomes but by the context in which they occur. We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions. The contributions are: (i) an empirically grounded moral-context dataset, (ii) a reproducible pipeline combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics, and (iii) an interpretable alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction and explanation.

### [3] [Oogiri-Master: Benchmarking Humor Understanding via Oogiri](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21494)
*Soichiro Murakami,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Hiroya Takamura,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers introduce Oogiri-Master benchmark and Oogiri-Corpus dataset to rigorously evaluate humor understanding in LLMs using Japanese creative response game, with ~100 diverse responses per prompt and independent human ratings to reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humor serves as a key testbed for human-like creative thinking in LLMs, but existing datasets have limitations: few candidate responses per prompt, exposure to popularity signals during ratings, and lack of objective, comparable metrics for funniness.

Method: Created Oogiri-Corpus dataset with ~100 diverse candidate responses per prompt, each rated independently by ~100 human judges without seeing others' ratings to reduce popularity bias. Used this to analyze linguistic factors (text length, ambiguity, incongruity resolution) and derive objective metrics. Then benchmarked various LLMs and human baselines using Oogiri-Master.

Result: Quantitative analysis identified linguistic factors associated with funniness. State-of-the-art LLMs approach human performance on the benchmark, and insight-augmented prompting further improves model performance.

Conclusion: The Oogiri-Master benchmark and Oogiri-Corpus dataset provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs, addressing previous limitations in humor evaluation datasets and enabling more rigorous assessment of creative thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Humor is a salient testbed for human-like creative thinking in large language models (LLMs). We study humor using the Japanese creative response game Oogiri, in which participants produce witty responses to a given prompt, and ask the following research question: What makes such responses funny to humans? Previous work has offered only limited reliable means to answer this question. Existing datasets contain few candidate responses per prompt, expose popularity signals during ratings, and lack objective and comparable metrics for funniness. Thus, we introduce Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus, which are a benchmark and dataset designed to enable rigorous evaluation of humor understanding in LLMs. Each prompt is paired with approximately 100 diverse candidate responses, and funniness is rated independently by approximately 100 human judges without access to others' ratings, reducing popularity bias and enabling robust aggregation. Using Oogiri-Corpus, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the linguistic factors associated with funniness, such as text length, ambiguity, and incongruity resolution, and derive objective metrics for predicting human judgments. Subsequently, we benchmark a range of LLMs and human baselines in Oogiri-Master, demonstrating that state-of-the-art models approach human performance and that insight-augmented prompting improves the model performance. Our results provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs.

### [4] [Beyond Heuristics: A Decision-Theoretic Framework for Agent Memory Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21567)
*Changzhi Sun,Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAM reframes LLM memory management as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, proposing a decision-theoretic framework that evaluates memory operations based on long-term utility and risk rather than relying on hand-designed heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory management in LLMs relies on hand-designed heuristics that lack insight into long-term consequences and uncertainty. Memory decisions (what to read/write) shape future retrieval and behavior in unpredictable ways, creating a need for a more principled approach.

Method: Proposes DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a framework that decomposes memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage maintenance. It evaluates candidate operations using value functions and uncertainty estimators, with an aggregate policy making decisions based on estimated long-term utility and risk.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than empirical results. DAM provides a principled reframing that clarifies limitations of heuristic approaches and establishes a foundation for future research on uncertainty-aware memory systems.

Conclusion: Memory management should be treated as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty. DAM offers a decision-theoretic foundation for developing more sophisticated, uncertainty-aware memory systems that can better handle the delayed utility and risk inherent in memory operations.

Abstract: External memory is a key component of modern large language model (LLM) systems, enabling long-term interaction and personalization. Despite its importance, memory management is still largely driven by hand-designed heuristics, offering little insight into the long-term and uncertain consequences of memory decisions. In practice, choices about what to read or write shape future retrieval and downstream behavior in ways that are difficult to anticipate. We argue that memory management should be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where the utility of memory is delayed and dependent on future interactions. To this end, we propose DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a decision-theoretic framework that decomposes memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage maintenance. Within this architecture, candidate operations are evaluated via value functions and uncertainty estimators, enabling an aggregate policy to arbitrate decisions based on estimated long-term utility and risk. Our contribution is not a new algorithm, but a principled reframing that clarifies the limitations of heuristic approaches and provides a foundation for future research on uncertainty-aware memory systems.

### [5] [A Unified Definition of Hallucination, Or: It's the World Model, Stupid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21577)
*Emmy Liu,Varun Gangal,Chelsea Zou,Xiaoqi Huang,Michael Yu,Alex Chang,Zhuofu Tao,Sachin Kumar,Steven Y. Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified definition of hallucination in LLMs as inaccurate internal world modeling observable to users, and proposes synthetic benchmarks to test world modeling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite years of research, hallucination remains a persistent problem in even state-of-the-art language models. The authors aim to unify disparate definitions of hallucination in the literature to create a common framework for evaluation and mitigation.

Method: The authors analyze historical and current definitions of hallucination, folding them into a single unified definition centered on inaccurate internal world modeling. They propose varying reference world models and knowledge conflict policies to capture different existing definitions, and outline plans for synthetic benchmarks with fully specified world models.

Result: The paper presents a unified definition of hallucination as inaccurate world modeling observable to users, which clarifies what should/shouldn't be called hallucination versus other error types. This framework provides common language for comparing benchmarks and mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: The unified definition enables clearer evaluation by forcing explicit assumptions about truth sources, and the proposed synthetic benchmarks will help stress-test and improve language models' world modeling components to address the persistent hallucination problem.

Abstract: Despite numerous attempts to solve the issue of hallucination since the inception of neural language models, it remains a problem in even frontier large language models today. Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.
  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed "world" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gamayun is a 1.5B-parameter multilingual LLM trained on 2.5T tokens with a novel two-stage pre-training strategy that achieves SOTA results for its size, outperforming larger models on English and multilingual benchmarks while excelling in Russian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of research on small non-English-centric LLMs for deployment in resource-constrained environments, with special focus on Russian language support.

Method: Two-stage pre-training: 1) balanced multilingual training for cross-lingual alignment, 2) high-quality English enrichment to transfer performance gains across languages. Trained from scratch on 2.5T tokens.

Result: Outperforms LLaMA3.2-1B (9T tokens) on all benchmarks, surpasses Qwen2.5-1.5B (18T tokens) on English/multilingual tasks, matches/exceeds Qwen3 (36T tokens) on most non-STEM tasks, achieves SOTA in Russian including MERA benchmark.

Conclusion: Gamayun demonstrates that efficient small multilingual LLMs can achieve competitive performance with significantly smaller training budgets through strategic pre-training approaches, particularly excelling in Russian language tasks.

Abstract: We present Gamayun, a 1.5B-parameter multilingual language model trained entirely from scratch on 2.5T tokens. Designed for efficiency and deployment in resource-constrained environments, Gamayun addresses the lack of research on small non-English-centric LLMs by adopting a novel two-stage pre-training strategy: balanced multilingual training for cross-lingual alignment, followed by high-quality English enrichment to transfer performance gains across languages. Our model supports 12 languages, with special focus on Russian. Despite a significantly smaller training budget than comparable models, Gamayun outperforms LLaMA3.2-1B (9T tokens) on all considered benchmarks, and surpasses Qwen2.5-1.5B (18T tokens) on a wide range of English and multilingual tasks. It matches or exceeds Qwen3 (36T tokens) on most tasks outside advanced STEM, achieving state-of-the-art results in Russian, including the MERA benchmark, among the models of comparable size (1-2B parameters).

### [7] [Rethinking Sample Polarity in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21625)
*Xinyu Tang,Yuliang Zhan,Zhixun Li,Wayne Xin Zhao,Zhenduo Zhang,Zujie Wen,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A3PO: Adaptive Asymmetric token-level Advantage shaping for Policy Optimization improves RLVR training by better allocating advantage signals to key tokens based on sample polarity (positive vs negative).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training uses both positive and negative self-generated rollouts, but current methods don't systematically understand how these different polarities affect training dynamics and behaviors.

Method: A3PO (Adaptive Asymmetric token-level Advantage shaping for Policy Optimization) - adjusts advantage values at both sample and token levels, more precisely allocating advantage signals to key tokens across different polarities.

Result: Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness. Positive samples sharpen existing correct reasoning patterns, while negative samples encourage exploration of new reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Systematic investigation reveals distinct roles of positive/negative samples in RLVR training, leading to A3PO which improves reasoning performance through better advantage signal allocation.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are typically trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to enhance their reasoning abilities. In this paradigm, policies are updated using both positive and negative self-generated rollouts, which correspond to distinct sample polarities. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation into how these sample polarities affect RLVR training dynamics and behaviors. We find that positive samples sharpen existing correct reasoning patterns, while negative samples encourage exploration of new reasoning paths. We further explore how adjusting the advantage values of positive and negative samples at both the sample level and the token level affects RLVR training. Based on these insights, we propose an Adaptive and Asymmetric token-level Advantage shaping method for Policy Optimization, namely A3PO, that more precisely allocates advantage signals to key tokens across different polarities. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [8] [Heaven-Sent or Hell-Bent? Benchmarking the Intelligence and Defectiveness of LLM Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21635)
*Chengxu Yang,Jingling Yuan,Siqi Cai,Jiawei Jiang,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HIC-Bench is a novel evaluation framework that categorizes LLM hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (creative/valuable) and Defective Hallucinations (errors), enabling systematic study of their interplay in scientific innovation tasks across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods focus too narrowly on factual consistency, failing to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. There's a need to quantify the creative or epistemically valuable content in some hallucinations that may drive scientific innovation.

Method: Proposes HIC-Bench framework with: 1) Structured IH/DH assessment using multi-dimensional metric matrix combining TTCT metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions; 2) Cross-domain applicability across ten scientific domains; 3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization with DHP to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. Uses multiple LLM judges with human verification.

Result: Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. Shows that Intelligent Hallucinations can act as catalysts for creativity and reveal LLM hallucinations' ability to drive scientific innovation.

Conclusion: HIC-Bench provides a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations, positioning Intelligent Hallucinations as potential catalysts for creativity rather than just errors to be minimized.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are commonly regarded as errors to be minimized. However, recent perspectives suggest that some hallucinations may encode creative or epistemically valuable content, a dimension that remains underquantified in current literature. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily focus on factual consistency, struggling to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. These insights position IH as a catalyst for creativity and reveal the ability of LLM hallucinations to drive scientific innovation.Additionally, the HIC-Bench offers a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations.

*Shuchang Pan,Siddharth Banerjee,Dhruv Hebbar,Siddhant Patel,Akshaj Gupta,Kan Jen Cheng,Hanjo Kim,Zeyi Austin Li,Martin Q. Ma,Tingle Li,Gopala Anumanchipalli,Jiachen Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Graph-of-Thoughts framework models conversational reasoning as causal inference, predicting speech acts and intents with interpretable justifications for full-duplex dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human conversation follows implicit causal chains of thoughts manifested as timed speech acts. Capturing this causal pathway is essential for building natural full-duplex interactive systems that can reason about conversational behaviors.

Method: Models conversation as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) using hierarchical labeling (high-level intents + low-level speech acts). Uses hybrid corpus of controllable simulations with human annotations and real speech. Structures streaming predictions as evolving graph, enabling multimodal transformer to forecast next speech act, generate justifications, and refine reasoning.

Result: Framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues.

Conclusion: The GoT framework successfully models the causal intent-to-action pathway in conversation, enabling interpretable reasoning and robust behavior prediction for full-duplex interactive systems.

Abstract: Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this causal pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that enables reasoning over conversational behaviors by modeling this process as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a hybrid corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich simulations with human-annotated rationales and real conversational speech. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a multimodal transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

*Jing Han,Binwei Yan,Tianyu Guo,Zheyuan Bai,Mengyu Zheng,Hanting Chen,Ying Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoR-Agent: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLM agents using specialized LoRA groups for different agent roles (reasoner, executor, summarizer) with multi-role data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite recent progress in fine-tuning LLMs for agent tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for agents remain largely unexplored, creating a gap in efficient agent adaptation.

Method: 1) Decompose agent tasks into three roles: reasoner (comprehends queries, determines next role), executor (identifies functions/parameters), summarizer (distills information). 2) Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework with three specialized LoRA groups for each role. 3) Multi-role data generation pipeline with role-specific content completion and reliability verification.

Result: Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: MoR-Agent provides an effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLM agents by decomposing agent capabilities into specialized roles and using role-specific LoRA groups, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to facilitate agent tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies for agent remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce three key strategies for PEFT in agent tasks: 1) Inspired by the increasingly dominant Reason+Action paradigm, we first decompose the capabilities necessary for the agent tasks into three distinct roles: reasoner, executor, and summarizer. The reasoner is responsible for comprehending the user's query and determining the next role based on the execution trajectory. The executor is tasked with identifying the appropriate functions and parameters to invoke. The summarizer conveys the distilled information from conversations back to the user. 2) We then propose the Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework, which comprises three specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) groups, each designated to fulfill a distinct role. By focusing on their respective specialized capabilities and engaging in collaborative interactions, these LoRAs collectively accomplish the agent task. 3) To effectively fine-tune the framework, we develop a multi-role data generation pipeline based on publicly available datasets, incorporating role-specific content completion and reliability verification. We conduct extensive experiments and thorough ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This project is publicly available at https://mor-agent.github.io.

*Md. Rakibul Islam,Most. Sharmin Sultana Samu,Md. Zahid Hossain,Farhad Uz Zaman,Md. Kamrozzaman Bhuiyan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates AI-generated text detection in Bengali using transformer models, finding that fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieve ~91% accuracy, significantly outperforming zero-shot approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali language detection of AI-generated text is largely unexplored despite concerns about LLM misuse for disinformation and content manipulation. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make detection particularly challenging compared to other languages.

Method: Evaluated five transformer-based models (XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base, MultilingualBERT-Base) using both zero-shot evaluation and task-specific fine-tuning for Bengali AI-generated text detection.

Result: Zero-shot evaluation showed near-chance performance (~50% accuracy). Fine-tuning significantly improved results: XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieved ~91% accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT showed weaker performance despite fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali, demonstrating that fine-tuned transformer models can effectively distinguish human-written from AI-generated Bengali text, establishing a foundation for robust detection systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can produce text that closely resembles human writing. This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance, indicating limited effectiveness in fine-tuning for this task. This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content.

### [12] [Do Latent Tokens Think? A Causal and Adversarial Analysis of Chain-of-Continuous-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21711)
*Yuyi Zhang,Boyu Tang,Tianjie Ju,Sufeng Duan,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COCONUT (Chain-of-Continuous-Thought) uses latent tokens that function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding genuine reasoning, promoting shortcut usage over faithful reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the internal mechanisms of latent tokens in LLMs, particularly examining COCONUT's claims of better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought while maintaining performance, from a reliability perspective.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) Steering experiments that perturb specific token subsets (COCONUT vs explicit CoT) to test sensitivity and reasoning-critical information, 2) Shortcut experiments evaluating models under biased and out-of-distribution settings on MMLU and HotpotQA benchmarks.

Result: COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information compared to CoT tokens. COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning, demonstrating shortcut dependence rather than genuine reasoning.

Conclusion: COCONUT functions as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism that generates plausible traces concealing shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes, revealing fundamental weaknesses in latent token approaches.

Abstract: Latent tokens are gaining attention for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their internal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.

### [13] [CATCH: A Controllable Theme Detection Framework with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21715)
*Rui Ke,Jiahui Xu,Shenghao Yang,Kuang Wang,Feng Jiang,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CATCH is a framework for theme detection in dialogues that uses contextualized clustering and hierarchical generation to overcome challenges with sparse utterances and user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. Theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, which poses significant challenges beyond intent induction.

Method: CATCH integrates three components: (1) context-aware topic representation using surrounding topic segments, (2) preference-guided topic clustering that jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback, and (3) hierarchical theme generation to suppress noise and produce coherent topic labels.

Result: Experiments on DSTC-12 multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark demonstrate CATCH's effectiveness with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

Conclusion: CATCH provides a unified framework that addresses key challenges in theme detection by combining contextualized clustering and hierarchical generation to achieve better cross-dialogue consistency and user preference alignment.

Abstract: Theme detection is a fundamental task in user-centric dialogue systems, aiming to identify the latent topic of each utterance without relying on predefined schemas. Unlike intent induction, which operates within fixed label spaces, theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, posing significant challenges. Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels. Experiments on a multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

TL;DR: Ara-HOPE is a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework for Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic translation, featuring error taxonomy and annotation protocol to assess MT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic metrics and general human evaluation frameworks fail to capture dialect-specific MT errors in DA-MSA translation, hindering progress in translation assessment and system improvement.

Method: Introduces Ara-HOPE framework with five-category error taxonomy and decision-tree annotation protocol for systematic human evaluation, applied to three MT systems: Arabic-centric Jais, general-purpose GPT-3.5, and baseline NLLB-200.

Result: Ara-HOPE effectively highlights systematic performance differences between MT systems, revealing that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation remain the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation.

Conclusion: Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems.

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic (DA-MSA) translation is a challenging task in Machine Translation (MT) due to significant lexical, syntactic, and semantic divergences between Arabic dialects and MSA. Existing automatic evaluation metrics and general-purpose human evaluation frameworks struggle to capture dialect-specific MT errors, hindering progress in translation assessment. This paper introduces Ara-HOPE, a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework designed to systematically address these challenges. The framework includes a five-category error taxonomy and a decision-tree annotation protocol. Through comparative evaluation of three MT systems (Arabic-centric Jais, general-purpose GPT-3.5, and baseline NLLB-200), Ara-HOPE effectively highlights systematic performance differences between these systems. The results show that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation remain the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation. Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems.

*Ting-Hao K. Huang,Ryan A. Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Tong Yu,Ting-Yao E. Hsu,Ho Yin,Ng,C. Lee Giles*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The SciCap project (2021-2025) evolved from a small seed-funded initiative into a major scientific figure-captioning effort, involving dataset curation, evaluations, LLM adaptation, challenges, and interactive captioning tools, with lessons learned and future challenges outlined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether domain-specific training (successful in text models like SciBERT) could also work for figure captions, and to improve scientific figure captioning through systematic research and tool development.

Method: Curated and released large collections of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers; conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions; adapted to the rise of LLMs; launched annual challenges; built interactive captioning systems.

Result: The project grew into a central effort shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape, involving multi-institution collaboration and producing valuable datasets, evaluation frameworks, and practical tools for scientists.

Conclusion: The paper summarizes key technical and methodological lessons from the first five years of SciCap and outlines five major unsolved challenges with proposed directions for future research in scientific figure captioning.

Abstract: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.

### [16] [On The Conceptualization and Societal Impact of Cross-Cultural Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21809)
*Vitthal Bhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of 20 recent papers on cultural bias in NLP reveals that current evaluation methods often fail to engage real stakeholders, limiting effective assessment of societal harms from cross-cultural bias in language technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on cultural bias in LLMs tends to generalize across cultures and often avoids engaging with real-world stakeholders, which undermines the fundamental goal of addressing cultural bias and its societal impacts.

Method: Conducted literature review of 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias in NLP, analyzing approaches to identifying and evaluating cultural bias, and developing observations to help researchers conceptualize bias more concretely.

Result: Developed a set of observations from recent literature that can guide NLP researchers to better conceptualize cultural bias and evaluate its harms effectively, moving beyond superficial assessments.

Conclusion: Advocates for more robust assessment of societal impact of language technologies with cross-cultural bias, emphasizing the need to engage real stakeholders and address concrete harms rather than just identifying bias patterns.

Abstract: Research has shown that while large language models (LLMs) can generate their responses based on cultural context, they are not perfect and tend to generalize across cultures. However, when evaluating the cultural bias of a language technology on any dataset, researchers may choose not to engage with stakeholders actually using that technology in real life, which evades the very fundamental problem they set out to address.
  Inspired by the work done by arXiv:2005.14050v2, I set out to analyse recent literature about identifying and evaluating cultural bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I picked out 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias and came up with a set of observations to allow NLP researchers in the future to conceptualize bias concretely and evaluate its harms effectively. My aim is to advocate for a robust assessment of the societal impact of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.

*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeMe is a framework that modifies LLM-generated task methods using dynamic decorations from hidden goals, learned methods, and environmental feedback, enabling IoT systems to adapt to unseen situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based IoT systems can't systematically generate new methods for unseen situations and rely on fixed, device-specific logic that doesn't adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Method: Method Decoration (DeMe) modifies LLM method-generation paths using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Decorations are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences, enabling method path reshuffling through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion.

Result: Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive more appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

Conclusion: DeMe provides a general framework for making LLM-generated methods context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive for intelligent IoT systems.

Abstract: Intelligent IoT systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate task-execution methods for dynamic environments. However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM approach integrating graph-structured information for tobacco pest/disease knowledge reasoning, combining GraphRAG framework with knowledge graph construction and GNN-enhanced representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control requires integrating structured domain knowledge with LLM capabilities to improve retrieval and reasoning accuracy.

Method: 1) LLM-assisted construction of tobacco pest/disease knowledge graph with entities and relationships; 2) GraphRAG framework for knowledge retrieval; 3) Transformer + GNN for node representations; 4) ChatGLM backbone fine-tuned with LoRA.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics, significantly improving accuracy and depth of reasoning, especially in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: Graph-structured information integration with LLMs effectively enhances knowledge reasoning in domain-specific applications like tobacco pest/disease control, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large language model (LLM) approach that integrates graph-structured information for knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control. Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic-English parallel corpora are scarce and existing datasets mainly consist of simple one-to-one mappings, lacking resources for complex texts like legal and literary documents needed for MT research and translation teaching.

Method: Presents AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and creates a new Arabic-English dataset with complex legal and literary texts. Evaluates alignment methods on both "Easy" and "Hard" subsets, with the Hard subset specifically designed to reduce one-to-one mappings.

Conclusion: The paper provides valuable resources for Arabic-English MT research and demonstrates the superiority of LLM-based alignment methods for complex sentence alignment tasks, highlighting the need for challenging evaluation datasets.

Abstract: High-quality parallel corpora are essential for Machine Translation (MT) research and translation teaching. However, Arabic-English resources remain scarce and existing datasets mainly consist of simple one-to-one mappings. In this paper, we present AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and a new Arabic-English dataset comprising complex legal and literary texts. Our evaluation demonstrates that "Easy" datasets lack the discriminatory power to fully assess alignment methods. By reducing one-to-one mappings in our "Hard" subset, we exposed the limitations of traditional alignment methods. In contrast, LLM-based approaches demonstrated superior robustness, achieving an overall F1-score of 85.5%, a 9% improvement over previous methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HeartBench is a Chinese LLM evaluation framework assessing emotional, cultural, and ethical intelligence through psychological counseling scenarios, revealing significant performance gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show persistent deficits in anthropomorphic intelligence (social, emotional, ethical navigation), especially in Chinese context due to lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data.

Method: Developed with clinical experts using authentic psychological counseling scenarios; structured around 5 primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities; uses case-specific rubric-based methodology with "reasoning-before-scoring" protocol.

Result: Evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs shows substantial performance ceiling - leading models achieve only 60% of expert-defined ideal score; significant performance decay in scenarios with subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs.

Conclusion: HeartBench establishes standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

*Qi Fan,An Zou,Yehan Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TimeBill: A time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that adaptively adjusts KV cache eviction ratio to meet varying time constraints while maintaining response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are deployed in time-critical systems (robotics, autonomous driving, etc.) where generating accurate responses within specific time budgets is crucial for decision-making and safety. Current methods struggle with modeling execution time and adapting KV cache eviction ratios to varying time constraints.

Method: Proposes TimeBill framework with: 1) Fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) to estimate output length, 2) Execution time estimator (ETE) to predict end-to-end execution time, and 3) Adaptive KV cache eviction ratio adjustment based on time predictions and given budget.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate TimeBill improves task completion rate and maintains response performance under various overrun strategies compared to fixed eviction ratio methods.

Conclusion: TimeBill effectively balances inference efficiency and response performance for LLMs in time-critical applications by adaptively managing KV cache eviction based on accurate time predictions and budget constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in time-critical systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and industrial automation, where generating accurate responses within a given time budget is crucial for decision-making, control, or safety-critical tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle with copyright compliance when processing copyrighted visual content, even with copyright notices. A new benchmark shows deficiencies, and a tool-augmented defense framework is proposed to reduce infringement risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of large vision-language models raises critical concerns about copyright infringement when they process copyrighted content like book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation. Failure to comply with copyright regulations could lead to serious legal and ethical consequences.

Method: 1) Created a large-scale benchmark dataset of 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs to evaluate copyright compliance. 2) Included two scenarios: with and without copyright notices (covering four types of notices). 3) Evaluated various LVLMs on how they handle copyrighted visual inputs. 4) Proposed a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance.

Result: Even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs show significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting copyrighted content, even when presented with copyright notices. The proposed defense framework reduces infringement risks across all scenarios.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need to develop copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content. Current models lack proper copyright compliance mechanisms, requiring new approaches like the proposed tool-augmented defense framework.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.

*Vaibhav Devraj,Dhruv Kumar,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CricBench is a specialized benchmark for evaluating LLMs on cricket data analytics, featuring complex SQL queries in English and Hindi, revealing domain-specific performance gaps and challenging assumptions about English as the optimal prompt language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cricket has 2.5+ billion fans who need advanced statistical insights not available through standard searches. While LLMs have advanced in Text-to-SQL, their ability to handle domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements in sports analytics remains under-explored.

Method: Created CricBench benchmark suite with domain experts manually authoring complex "Gold Standard" queries for cricket data. Built benchmark in both English and Hindi, with framework extensible to other languages. Evaluated 6 state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, open-source models) using strict evaluation protocol.

Result: High performance on general benchmarks doesn't guarantee success in specialized domains. DeepSeek R1 achieved SOTA (50.6%), surpassing Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), but showed significant accuracy drop from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yielded parity or higher accuracy than English.

Conclusion: Specialized domains like cricket analytics present unique challenges for LLMs. The assumption that English is optimal for specialized SQL tasks is challenged by Hindi queries performing equally or better. Domain-specific benchmarks are crucial for evaluating real-world LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, commanding a massive following of over 2.5 billion fans globally. Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a "Gold Standard" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.

*Sachin Pawar,Girish Keshav Palshikar,Anindita Sinha Banerjee,Nitin Ramrakhiyani,Basit Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automatic statute prediction with explanations using two approaches: AoS (attention-based supervised model) and LLMPrompt (zero-shot LLM prompting), evaluated on legal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build AI-assistants for lawyers and legal QA systems that not only predict relevant statutes but also provide human-understandable explanations for better user acceptance.

Method: Two techniques: (1) AoS uses sentence transformers with attention over case descriptions in supervised training; (2) LLMPrompt uses larger language models with zero-shot prompting (standard and Chain-of-Thought) to predict statutes and generate explanations.

Result: Both methods produce explanations and are compared against baselines across two datasets. Explanation quality is evaluated through automated counter-factual analysis and human evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper presents two complementary approaches for statute prediction with explanations - one supervised and efficient (AoS), and one zero-shot and flexible (LLMPrompt), addressing the need for explainable legal AI systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of automatic statute prediction where for a given case description, a subset of relevant statutes are to be predicted. Here, the term "statute" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets. Also, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanations through an automated counter-factual manner as well as through human evaluation.

TL;DR: Sparse verification framework for speculative decoding that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components to reduce computational bottleneck during verification stage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The verification stage in speculative decoding becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, while existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding.

Method: Systematically adopts different sparse methods on verification stage, identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions, proposes sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components, and incorporates inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs while maintaining stable acceptance length.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse verification framework effectively reduces dominant computation cost in speculative decoding verification stage through joint sparsification and reuse strategies without additional training.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive language model inference by verifying multiple draft tokens in parallel. However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.

### [26] [SWE-RM: Execution-free Feedback For Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21919)
*KaShun Shum,Binyuan Hui,Jiawei Chen,Lei Zhang,X. W.,Jiaxi Yang,Yuzhen Huang,Junyang Lin,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-RM, a reward model for software engineering agents that addresses limitations of execution-based feedback by providing fine-grained execution-free feedback that works well for both test-time scaling and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Execution-based feedback (unit testing) has limitations: it requires scalable test case collection, provides sparse feedback, and cannot distinguish between equally successful/unsuccessful trajectories. Execution-free feedback from reward models offers more fine-grained signals but is underexplored for SWE agents. The authors aim to develop versatile reward models effective across both TTS and RL.

Method: Identified that TTS performance doesn't guarantee good RL results, so they identified two crucial aspects for RL: classification accuracy and calibration. Conducted comprehensive controlled experiments on training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Developed SWE-RM using a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters (3B activated during inference).

Result: SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. It increased Qwen3-Coder-Flash accuracy from 51.6% to 62.0% and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that execution-free reward models can effectively improve software engineering agents when designed with consideration for both TTS and RL requirements, particularly focusing on classification accuracy and calibration. SWE-RM shows significant performance improvements and sets new benchmarks for open-source models.

Abstract: Execution-based feedback like unit testing is widely used in the development of coding agents through test-time scaling (TTS) and reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm requires scalable and reliable collection of unit test cases to provide accurate feedback, and the resulting feedback is often sparse and cannot effectively distinguish between trajectories that are both successful or both unsuccessful. In contrast, execution-free feedback from reward models can provide more fine-grained signals without depending on unit test cases. Despite this potential, execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering (SWE) agents remains underexplored. Aiming to develop versatile reward models that are effective across TTS and RL, however, we observe that two verifiers with nearly identical TTS performance can nevertheless yield very different results in RL. Intuitively, TTS primarily reflects the model's ability to select the best trajectory, but this ability does not necessarily generalize to RL. To address this limitation, we identify two additional aspects that are crucial for RL training: classification accuracy and calibration. We then conduct comprehensive controlled experiments to investigate how to train a robust reward model that performs well across these metrics. In particular, we analyze the impact of various factors such as training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Guided by these investigations, we introduce SWE-RM, an accurate and robust reward model adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference. SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. For example, it increases the accuracy of Qwen3-Coder-Flash from 51.6% to 62.0%, and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

### [27] [Broken Words, Broken Performance: Effect of Tokenization on Performance of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21933)
*Sachin Pawar,Manoj Apte,Kshitij Jadhav,Girish Keshav Palshikar,Nitin Ramrakhiyani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes tokenization penalty functions to quantify how breaking natural words into multiple tokens negatively impacts LLM performance on NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM tokenization differs from traditional NLP tokenization by breaking natural words into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size, which may negatively impact model performance on NLP tasks.

Method: Proposes a set of penalty functions that compute tokenization penalty for given text and specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is.

Result: Establishes statistical significance of the hypothesis that breaking natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on multiple NLP tasks across different LLMs.

Conclusion: Tokenization that breaks natural words into multiple tokens has measurable negative effects on LLM performance, and proposed penalty functions can quantify this impact.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first step in training any Large Language Model (LLM), where the text is split into a sequence of tokens as per the model's fixed vocabulary. This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of "natural" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits "martial" into "mart" and "ial"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.

### [28] [Self-attention vector output similarities reveal how machines pay attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21956)
*Tal Halevi,Yarden Tzach,Ronit D. Gross,Shalom Rosner,Ido Kanter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method to quantify information processing in self-attention mechanisms, analyzing BERT-12 to reveal how attention heads specialize in different linguistic features and how similarity patterns evolve across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While self-attention has advanced NLP, the precise mechanisms underlying its learning process and quantitative characterization remain poorly understood. The study aims to develop methods to quantify how self-attention processes information.

Method: The authors introduce a new approach for quantifying information processing in self-attention, analyzing BERT-12 architecture. They examine attention maps, derive context similarity matrices from vector spaces emerging from self-attention heads, and analyze token vector similarities across layers and heads.

Result: Analysis reveals that final layers focus on sentence separator tokens, suggesting semantic text segmentation. Different attention heads specialize in distinct linguistic features (token repetitions, common tokens with context). Initial layers show long-range similarities, while deeper layers develop short-range similarities, culminating in strong intra-sentence similarities. Each head focuses on unique tokens and builds similarity pairs around them.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative insights into self-attention mechanisms, revealing systematic specialization of attention heads and evolution of similarity patterns across layers, offering practical implications for text segmentation and understanding how transformers process linguistic information.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, facilitating the development of advanced language-learning machines. Although its utility is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms of self-attention underlying its advanced learning and the quantitative characterization of this learning process remains an open research question. This study introduces a new approach for quantifying information processing within the self-attention mechanism. The analysis conducted on the BERT-12 architecture reveals that, in the final layers, the attention map focuses on sentence separator tokens, suggesting a practical approach to text segmentation based on semantic features. Based on the vector space emerging from the self-attention heads, a context similarity matrix, measuring the scalar product between two token vectors was derived, revealing distinct similarities between different token vector pairs within each head and layer. The findings demonstrated that different attention heads within an attention block focused on different linguistic characteristics, such as identifying token repetitions in a given text or recognizing a token of common appearance in the text and its surrounding context. This specialization is also reflected in the distribution of distances between token vectors with high similarity as the architecture progresses. The initial attention layers exhibit substantially long-range similarities; however, as the layers progress, a more short-range similarity develops, culminating in a preference for attention heads to create strong similarities within the same sentence. Finally, the behavior of individual heads was analyzed by examining the uniqueness of their most common tokens in their high similarity elements. Each head tends to focus on a unique token from the text and builds similarity pairs centered around it.

*Shukai Liu,Jian Yang,Bo Jiang,Yizhi Li,Jinyang Guo,Xianglong Liu,Bryan Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAT introduces a proactive context management system for LLM-based software engineering agents that compresses historical interactions into structured summaries to maintain bounded context while preserving reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents for software engineering tasks suffer from context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning in long-running interactions due to append-only context maintenance or passive compression heuristics.

Method: Proposes CAT: a callable context management tool with structured workspace (stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, high-fidelity short-term interactions). Introduces CAT-GENERATOR framework for trajectory-level supervision and trains SWE-Compressor model using offline data construction with injected context-management actions.

Result: SWE-Compressor achieves 57.6% solved rate on SWE-Bench-Verified, significantly outperforming ReAct-based agents and static compression baselines while maintaining stable reasoning under bounded context budget.

Conclusion: Proactive context management integrated into agent decision-making enables scalable long-horizon reasoning for software engineering tasks by preventing context explosion and preserving semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models have recently shown strong potential on real-world software engineering (SWE) tasks that require long-horizon interaction with repository-scale codebases. However, most existing agents rely on append-only context maintenance or passively triggered compression heuristics, which often lead to context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning in long-running interactions. We propose CAT, a new context management paradigm that elevates context maintenance to a callable tool integrated into the decision-making process of agents. CAT formalizes a structured context workspace consisting of stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, and high-fidelity short-term interactions, and enables agents to proactively compress historical trajectories into actionable summaries at appropriate milestones. To support context management for SWE-agents, we propose a trajectory-level supervision framework, CAT-GENERATOR, based on an offline data construction pipeline that injects context-management actions into complete interaction trajectories. Using this framework, we train a context-aware model, SWE-Compressor. Experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that SWE-Compressor reaches a 57.6% solved rate and significantly outperforms ReAct-based agents and static compression baselines, while maintaining stable and scalable long-horizon reasoning under a bounded context budget.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces TrGLUE, the first comprehensive Turkish NLU benchmark, and SentiTurca for sentiment analysis, with tools for transformer model fine-tuning and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of comprehensive NLU benchmarks for Turkish language despite existing benchmarks for English (GLUE), Chinese (CLUE), French (FLUE), and Japanese (JGLUE). This gap hinders proper evaluation of Turkish NLP systems.

Method: Created Turkish-native corpora mirroring GLUE-style evaluations using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and human validation to ensure linguistic naturalness and minimize translation artifacts.

Result: Developed TrGLUE (comprehensive Turkish NLU benchmark) and SentiTurca (specialized sentiment analysis benchmark), along with fine-tuning/evaluation code for transformer models.

Conclusion: TrGLUE establishes a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, provides valuable resources for researchers, and offers insights into creating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

*Arnav Gupta,Gurekas Singh Sahney,Hardik Rathi,Abhishek Chandwani,Ishaan Gupta,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a data-driven framework using Vision-Language Models to extract audiovisual features from short-form videos, cluster them into interpretable factors, and train a regression model to predict human engagement, outperforming traditional quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation frameworks focus on visual/semantic fidelity but fail to capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement, especially for short-form content like YouTube Shorts.

Method: Uses VLMs to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator on a curated YouTube Shorts dataset to predict engagement metrics.

Result: Strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that the lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics like SSIM and FID.

Conclusion: The approach advances video understanding by grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, offering robust and explainable assessment for short-form content.

Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.

### [32] [A Tool Bottleneck Framework for Clinically-Informed and Interpretable Medical Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21414)
*Christina Liu,Alan Q. Wang,Joy Hsu,Jiajun Wu,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF) improves medical image understanding by using a learned neural network (TBM) to compose specialized tool outputs instead of text-based composition, achieving better performance especially in data-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-use frameworks for vision-language models rely on text-based composition of tools, which performs poorly on medical images where clinically-relevant features are spatially-localized and difficult to describe in text alone.

Method: TBF uses an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select specialized tools that extract clinically-relevant features, then composes them via a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM) - a neural network that fuses tool outputs for final prediction, with a strategy to handle arbitrary VLM tool selections.

Result: TBF performs on par with or better than deep learning classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks on histopathology and dermatology tasks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes, while providing more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictions.

Conclusion: The Tool Bottleneck Framework addresses limitations of text-based tool composition in medical imaging by using learned neural fusion, improving performance, interpretability, and clinical relevance, especially when training data is limited.

Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

*Nairouz Mrabah,Mohamed Bouguessa,Sihem Sami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDSNet is a scalable deep subspace clustering method that reduces complexity from O(n³) to O(n) using landmark approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices and enabling efficient spectral clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subspace clustering methods suffer from O(n³) computational complexity due to constructing full n×n affinity matrices and performing spectral decomposition, creating scalability limitations. Deep learning approaches improve feature extraction but maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations.

Method: SDSNet uses: (1) landmark-based approximation to avoid full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints.

Result: Experimental results show SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods while offering significantly improved computational efficiency with O(n) complexity instead of O(n³).

Conclusion: SDSNet provides a scalable deep subspace clustering framework that maintains clustering quality while dramatically reducing computational complexity, making subspace clustering more practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

*Xiao Jin,Liang Diao,Qixin Xiao,Yifan Hu,Ziqi Zhang,Yuchen Liu,Haisong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCAD combines reconstruction-based and representation-based anomaly detection by using compressed global features as a condition for reconstruction, improving performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods have limitations: unsupervised representation-based methods struggle with domain shift, while reconstruction-based methods suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints.

Method: CCAD synergizes both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for reconstruction models, with an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance generalization and training efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in AUC while achieving faster convergence. The authors also contribute a reorganized and re-annotated DAGM 2007 dataset.

Conclusion: CCAD effectively addresses limitations of existing anomaly detection approaches by combining representation and reconstruction paradigms, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness.

TL;DR: ISIC MultiAnnot++ is the largest publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset with 17,684 masks across 14,967 dermoscopic images, including annotator metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation datasets with annotator labels for dermoscopic imaging, which is needed for research on annotator-specific modeling and metadata analysis.

Method: Created ISIC MultiAnnot++ by collecting and curating segmentation masks from the ISIC Archive, including 2,394 images with 2-5 segmentations per image, and adding metadata about annotators' skill level and segmentation tools.

Result: The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, making it the largest publicly available skin lesion segmentation dataset with multi-annotator labels and metadata.

Conclusion: ISIC MultiAnnot++ enables research on annotator-specific preference modeling, metadata analysis, and provides curated data partitions and consensus segmentation masks for the research community.

Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Gated Progressive Fusion network for colonoscopic polyp re-identification, using multi-level feature fusion with gating mechanisms to improve matching accuracy for small polyps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colonoscopic polyp re-identification is crucial for colorectal cancer prevention but faces challenges with small polyps where coarse high-level features lead to inferior results due to loss of detailed information.

Method: Gated Progressive Fusion network that selectively fuses features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way, with gated progressive fusion strategy for layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show benefits over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses the challenge of matching small polyps by preserving detailed information through selective multi-level feature fusion, improving polyp re-identification performance.

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

*Xinzhe Xie,Buyu Guo,Bolin Li,Shuangyan He,Yanzhen Gu,Qingyan Jiang,Peiliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMFF is a two-stage generative multi-focus image fusion framework that first performs deterministic fusion using StackMFF V4, then uses IFControlNet (latent diffusion model) for generative restoration to handle missing focal planes and eliminate edge artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-focus fusion methods assume every spatial location has at least one in-focus input image, and suffer from edge artifacts due to uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Deterministic fusion using StackMFF V4 with focal plane information to produce initial fused image; 2) Generative restoration using IFControlNet (latent diffusion model) to reconstruct missing focal plane content, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts.

Result: GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and shows significant potential for practical applications, especially in complex multi-focal content scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed GMFF framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by combining deterministic fusion with generative restoration, producing high-quality all-in-focus images even with missing focal information and eliminating edge artifacts.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.

*Wenshuo Peng,Gongxuan Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Chuanhao Li,Xiaojie Xu,Hui He,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers create first benchmark for evaluating social reasoning in video generation, revealing current models fail at understanding social cognition despite visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models generate visually realistic scenes but lack social coherence - they can't infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, or social norms like humans do from visual cues.

Method: Developed a training-free agent-based pipeline that: 1) distills reasoning mechanisms from 30 classic social cognition paradigms, 2) synthesizes diverse video scenarios, 3) enforces conceptual neutrality through cue-based critique, and 4) evaluates videos using VLM judge across 5 social reasoning dimensions.

Result: Large-scale study across 7 state-of-the-art video generation systems shows substantial performance gaps - models excel in surface-level plausibility but systematically fail at intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

Conclusion: There's a critical gap between visual realism and social reasoning in current video generation models, highlighting the need for models that understand underlying psychological and social logic beyond literal scene rendering.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

### [40] [Fixed-Budget Parameter-Efficient Training with Frozen Encoders Improves Multimodal Chest X-Ray Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21508)
*Md Ashik Khan,Md Nahid Siddique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient training methods (frozen encoders, adapters, LoRA) achieve better chest X-ray classification performance than full fine-tuning with 40x fewer parameters, but have calibration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal chest X-ray analysis typically requires computationally expensive fine-tuning of large vision-language models. The paper aims to study parameter-efficient training strategies to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Evaluated parameter-efficient training strategies including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset. Used text inputs with redacted pathology terms to prevent data leakage. Conducted budget-matched comparisons and external validation on CheXpert dataset.

Result: All PET variants achieved AUROC between 0.892-0.908 with only 2.37M parameters (2.51% of total), outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC with 94.3M parameters). External validation confirmed scalability. Vision-only models outperformed budget-matched multimodal models, suggesting improvements come from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. PET methods showed degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34).

Conclusion: Frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, making them practical for clinical applications. However, calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment due to degraded calibration performance of PET methods.

Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.

### [41] [Fixed-Threshold Evaluation of a Hybrid CNN-ViT for AI-Generated Image Detection Across Photos and Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21512)
*Md Ashik Khan,Arafat Alam Jion*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol for AI-generated image detectors to provide deployment-relevant robustness assessment, revealing that ViTs maintain performance under compression while CNNs collapse, and that semantic patterns in artistic content provide more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods use misleading robustness estimates by retuning thresholds per condition, which artificially inflates performance and masks deployment failures. There's a need for deployment-critical evaluation that maintains fixed decision thresholds across post-processing transformations.

Method: Introduced fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds (selected once on clean validation data) fixed across all post-processing transformations. Used a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid architecture with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement, evaluated at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing.

Result: Revealed forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos (93.33%) but collapse under compression (61.49%), while ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%). All architectures achieved 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) vs photorealistic images (0.747-0.759). Hybrid approach achieved balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on photos, 89.7% on art/graphics, and 98.3% on CIFAKE.

Conclusion: Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation and reveals genuine robustness gaps, providing actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening. Semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts.

Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.

TL;DR: MuS-Polar3D is a benchmark dataset for polarization-based underwater 3D imaging with controlled scattering conditions, supporting multiple vision tasks and enabling fair algorithm evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polarization-based underwater 3D imaging datasets lack diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons between different approaches like single-view and multi-view methods.

Method: Constructed MuS-Polar3D dataset with 42 objects captured under 7 controlled scattering conditions and 5 viewpoints, providing polarization images, high-precision 3D models, normal maps, and foreground masks. Proposed a two-stage pipeline (descattering followed by 3D reconstruction) inspired by computational imaging.

Result: Extensive evaluations show effectiveness of the benchmark, achieving best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging.

Conclusion: MuS-Polar3D enables accurate 3D reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions, addressing limitations of existing datasets and advancing polarization-based underwater imaging research.

Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WangPuyun/MuS-Polar3D.

*Henglin Liu,Huijuan Huang,Jing Wang,Chang Liu,Xiu Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses diversity degradation in GRPO-based image generation by proposing distributional creativity rewards and structure-aware regularization to improve visual diversity while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GRPO methods suffer from homogenized outputs in later training stages, lacking creativity and visual diversity due to single-sample reward signals and misaligned regularization that neglects early-stage denoising's role in preserving diversity.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Distributional creativity bonus using spectral clustering over semantically grouped samples to allocate exploratory rewards based on group sizes, encouraging novel visual modes. 2) Structure-aware regularization that enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency.

Result: The method achieves 13-18% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

Conclusion: By addressing both reward modeling and generation dynamics, the proposed approach successfully mitigates diversity degradation in GRPO-based image generation, enabling better quality-diversity trade-offs and expanding application scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

*Jiayu Li,Rajesh Gangireddy,Samet Akcay,Wei Cheng,Juhua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework for Vision-Language Models that enforces structural consistency in hierarchical classification with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require expensive full fine-tuning, producing inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels in hierarchical classification.

Method: Combines Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) for vertical coherence along ground-truth label paths and Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) for consistent predictions among sibling classes, integrated with lightweight LoRA adaptation in VLM's shared embedding space.

Result: Consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient strategy for adapting Vision-Language Models to structured taxonomies while maintaining hierarchical consistency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

*Dongchen Han,Tianyu Li,Ziyi Wang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Circulant Attention: A novel attention mechanism that models self-attention as Block Circulant matrices to achieve O(NlogN) complexity while maintaining model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in vision Transformers has quadratic complexity, creating computational burdens in high-resolution scenarios. Previous methods use handcrafted patterns like locality or sparsity, but these compromise model capacity.

Method: Identifies that self-attention matrices in vision Transformers approximate Block Circulant matrices with Circulant Blocks (BCCB). Models attention maps as nearest BCCB matrices and develops efficient computation algorithms for fast calculation with O(NlogN) complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate effectiveness. The approach maintains capacity of standard self-attention while achieving significant computational efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: Circulant Attention presents a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformers, offering efficient computation without sacrificing model capacity by leveraging inherent efficient patterns in attention matrices.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

### [46] [EraseLoRA: MLLM-Driven Foreground Exclusion and Background Subtype Aggregation for Dataset-Free Object Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21545)
*Sanghyun Jo,Donghwan Lee,Eunji Jung,Seong Je Oh,Kyungsu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EraseLoRA is a dataset-free object removal framework that uses background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation to prevent target object reappearance while preserving structural fidelity, outperforming existing attention-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object removal requires preventing target reappearance and reconstructing occluded background with structural fidelity, not just plausible hole filling. Current dataset-free approaches using attention redirection fail by misinterpreting non-target foregrounds as background (causing unwanted regeneration) and disrupting fine details through direct attention manipulation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE) uses multimodal LLMs to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from single image-mask pairs without supervision. 2) Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA) performs test-time optimization treating background subtypes as complementary pieces, enforcing consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives without explicit attention intervention.

Result: EraseLoRA demonstrates consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods across object removal benchmarks, validating it as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of attention-based approaches by replacing attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation, achieving reliable object removal without dataset dependency while preserving local detail and global structure.

Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: Paper introduces two new tasks for advertising/digital media: context-aware object insertion and sponsor-product logo augmentation, with corresponding datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing approaches using VLMs and diffusion models lack contextual appropriateness for inserted objects, especially in advertising and digital media applications.

Method: Proposes two new tasks: (1) context-aware object insertion (predicting suitable categories, generating objects, placing plausibly), and (2) sponsor-product logo augmentation (detecting products and inserting correct brand logos). Builds two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

Result: Introduction of two novel tasks and creation of corresponding datasets to support research in contextual object insertion and brand logo augmentation for advertising/digital media.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the gap in contextual appropriateness for object insertion in image editing, particularly for advertising applications, by defining new tasks and providing datasets to facilitate research in this area.

Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes reproducibility and generalizability issues in AI-Generated Content (AIGC) image detection, identifying key problems through literature review, dataset construction, and method reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of AIGC image detection faces two core problems: poor reproducibility and insufficient generalizability, which hinder practical application of these technologies.

Method: The study reviews 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructs a lightweight test dataset, and reproduces a representative detection method to identify root causes of reproducibility issues.

Result: Basic performance can be reproduced when strictly following core procedures, but detection performance drops sharply when preprocessing disrupts key features or when testing across different generators. Two root causes identified: papers omit implicit details (preprocessing, parameters), and methods overfit to exclusive features of specific generators rather than learning universal intrinsic features.

Conclusion: The research provides empirical evidence for improving AIGC detection reproducibility and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose experimental details more comprehensively and verify method generalizability.

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

TL;DR: LAid: A knowledge distillation method that transfers long-range attention mechanisms from large to small vision-language models, enabling up to 3.2x longer effective context windows while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small vision-language models have limited window sizes that fail at linguistics-photography alignment, despite large VLMs demonstrating strong long-context understanding. There's a need to transfer long-range attention capabilities to smaller, more efficient models.

Method: LAid uses two complementary components: 1) progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and 2) learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed.

Result: LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis shows LAid preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer.

Conclusion: LAid provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs and offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation, addressing the window size limitations of small vision-language models.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

Conclusion: Pearl provides an effective LLM-free solution for image caption evaluation that addresses bias issues in LLM-based metrics while maintaining high performance across multiple evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: UltraLBM-UNet is highly suitable for point-of-care deployment due to its accurate, robust, and computationally efficient lesion segmentation capabilities.

Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance. These results highlight the suitability of UltraLBM-UNet for point-of-care deployment, where accurate and robust lesion analyses are essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing harmful meme detection methods require large labeled datasets with manual annotation, limiting adaptability to evolving harmful content online.

Method: ALARM uses Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification to isolate explicit memes with pseudo-labels, then employs Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement where explicit memes are organized into contrastive pairs to refine an LMM agent.

Result: Experiments on three diverse datasets show superior performance and strong adaptability to newly evolved memes, even outperforming label-driven methods.

Conclusion: ALARM demonstrates the potential of label-free frameworks as scalable solutions for adapting to novel forms of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from "shallow" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent. This agent autonomously derives high-level detection cues from these pairs, which in turn empower the agent itself to handle complex and challenging memes effectively. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance and strong adaptability of ALARM to newly evolved memes. Notably, our method even outperforms label-driven methods. These results highlight the potential of label-free frameworks as a scalable and promising solution for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding protein flexibility and dynamic interactions is essential for protein function study. Cryo-EM provides opportunities to observe macromolecular dynamics, but analyzing datasets containing both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging.

Method: GaussianEM employs a Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework with a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map cryo-EM images to individual Gaussian components. It represents structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters, providing an interpretable description of conformational changes while preserving local structural consistency.

Result: The approach provides intuitive and interpretable descriptions of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along transition trajectories, and bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models.

Conclusion: GaussianEM demonstrates effectiveness on both simulated and experimental cryo-EM datasets, offering a solution for analyzing macromolecular dynamics that contain both continuous motions and discrete states.

Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for protein function study. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to directly observe macromolecular dynamics. However, analyzing datasets that contain both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging. Here we present GaussianEM, a Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework that simultaneously models compositional and conformational heterogeneity from experimental cryo-EM images. GaussianEM employs a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map an image to its individual Gaussian components, and represent structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters. This approach provides an intuitive and interpretable description of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along the transition trajectories, and naturally bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GaussianEM on both simulated and experimental datasets.

*Rongpei Hong,Jian Lang,Ting Zhong,Yong Wang,Fan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCMP introduces the first long-context MLLM personalization benchmark, and TAME provides a training-free framework with double memories and RA2G for evolving personalized conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM personalization methods focus only on simple visual identification and textual replacement, lacking support for long-context conversations where personalized assistants should learn from past dialogue histories and continually improve experience quality.

Method: Proposes LCMP benchmark for evaluating long-context personalization, and TAME framework with double memories (temporal and persistent) to manage concept variations, plus RA2G (Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation) that aligns retrieved knowledge to current questions.

Result: TAME achieves best performance on LCMP benchmark, demonstrating remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: LCMP addresses the gap in long-context MLLM personalization evaluation, and TAME's training-free, state-aware approach with double memories and RA2G effectively enables evolving personalized conversations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

### [55] [CausalFSFG: Rethinking Few-Shot Fine-Grained Visual Categorization from Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21617)
*Zhiwen Yang,Jinglin Xu,Yuxin Pen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalFSFG: A causal inference approach for few-shot fine-grained visual categorization that addresses biased data distributions and spurious correlations through sample-level and feature-level interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-FGVC methods overlook that support samples act as confounding variables, introducing biased data distribution and misleading discriminative feature extraction, which hampers performance.

Method: Proposes CausalFSFG with two key components: 1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) for sample-level interventions, and 2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) for feature-level interventions, both based on structural causal modeling to eliminate spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars datasets through extensive experiments and thorough analyses.

Conclusion: CausalFSFG effectively addresses biased distributions in FS-FGVC by revealing real causalities from inputs to subcategories through causal intervention, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Method: Proposes SymDrive with Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm: constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation, uses auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation, and employs training-free harmonization mechanism treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion, achieving seamless lighting and shadow consistency.

Conclusion: SymDrive provides a unified solution for high-fidelity, controllable 3D simulation in autonomous driving, addressing long-tail data scarcity through joint rendering and editing capabilities.

Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the PPE framework for disentangled image editing, identifies limitations in its regularization strategy, and proposes L1 sparsity constraints to reduce semantic leakage while preserving identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying one attribute unintentionally alters other semantic properties. The PPE framework aims to address this issue but has limitations in its regularization approach.

Method: Analyzes the PPE framework's BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based generation on CelebA-HQ. Identifies that latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. Proposes adding L1 regularization on latent space manipulation to enforce sparsity and more focused edits.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed sparsity-based constraint enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: L1 regularization on latent space manipulation improves the PPE framework by reducing semantic leakage and enabling more disentangled attribute editing while maintaining identity preservation.

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: Temporal reasoning and multimodal fusion are crucial for accurate language-based 3D grounding in dynamic driving scenes, and TrackTeller effectively addresses these challenges through its unified architecture.

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone.

We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models achieve high accuracy but operate as "black boxes" with opaque decision processes, making it difficult to understand what features they rely on and why they make specific decisions.

Method: Combines sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how model features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations.

Result: Only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold (intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, feature selectivity) vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts.

Conclusion: Provides a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, enabling identification of which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and guiding development of more interpretable and robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation methods filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, but this limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. There's a need for a method that can effectively transfer knowledge across domains without sacrificing performance on the source domain.

Method: 1) Represent image features as graphs with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. 2) Introduce Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer to capture target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling. 3) Develop Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. 4) Design Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity through contrastive learning.

Result: The method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

Conclusion: C-Graph effectively leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior, addressing limitations of existing methods by maintaining both cross-domain performance and source-domain accuracy through graph-based modeling and contrastive learning techniques.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) offers a promising and data-efficient solution for medical applications where annotations are severely scarce and multimodal analysis is required. However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

Motivation: VLMs are increasingly used for educational content but their semantic outputs are hard to verify, reproduce, and audit over time, especially in high-stakes STEM domains where inconsistencies across models and environments undermine reliability.

Method: Introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework that extracts concepts and relational triples from VLMs, constructs structured provenance records, and anchors cryptographic hashes on a local EVM-compatible blockchain. Uses SlideChain Slides Dataset of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides with four state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VGGT's state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction suffers from attention collapse when processing long sequences (hundreds of frames), and to provide a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon.

Method: Mathematical analysis viewing global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process, proving token-feature flow converges to Dirac-type measure at O(1/L) rate, deriving closed-form mean-field PDE that predicts rank profile.

Result: The theory quantitatively matches observed attention-heat-map evolution and experimental outcomes, explains why token-merging remedy works by slowing diffusion coefficient, and provides principled interpretation for scalable 3D-vision transformers.

Conclusion: The analysis offers a rigorous mathematical explanation for VGGT's attention collapse, provides a framework for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers, and suggests potential for multi-modal generalization.

Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.

Conclusion: ShinyNeRF successfully addresses the limitation of existing NeRF methods in modeling anisotropic specular surfaces, offering improved realism and practical editing capabilities for cultural heritage digitization.

Abstract: Recent advances in digitization technologies have transformed the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In this vein, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a leading technology for 3D digitization, delivering representations with exceptional realism. However, existing methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces, typically observed, for example, on brushed metals. In this work, we introduce ShinyNeRF, a novel framework capable of handling both isotropic and anisotropic reflections. Our method is capable of jointly estimating surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes of an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, by learning an approximation of the outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. Experimental results show that ShinyNeRF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on digitizing anisotropic specular reflections, but also offers plausible physical interpretations and editing of material properties compared to existing methods.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation of macular edema is essential for clinical diagnosis and management of vision-threatening conditions like age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Current challenges include ambiguous boundaries in OCT images and cross-device heterogeneity.

Method: Introduces Prior-AttUNet with hybrid dual-path architecture: generative prior pathway using variational autoencoder for multi-scale normative anatomical priors, and segmentation backbone with densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling. Novel triple-attention mechanism guided by anatomical priors dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages.

Conclusion: Prior-AttUNet demonstrates potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis of macular edema, effectively addressing challenges of ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of macular edema, a hallmark pathological feature in vision-threatening conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation. Evaluated on the public RETOUCH benchmark, Prior-AttUNet achieves excellent performance across three OCT imaging devices (Cirrus, Spectralis, and Topcon), with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.93%, 95.18%, and 93.47%, respectively. The model maintains a low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs, striking an effective balance between segmentation precision and inference efficiency. These results demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis.

Result: The approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text, successfully generating Bengali handwritten words.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area, addressing the research gap for Bengali HTG.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text. We believe this work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area.

TL;DR: FUSE is a hybrid AI-generated image detection system combining spectral (FFT) and semantic (CLIP) features, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets with strong generalization to diverse generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI models has created an urgent need for reliable detection of AI-generated images, as existing methods often fail to generalize well across different generators and struggle with high-fidelity images.

Method: FUSE extracts spectral features using Fast Fourier Transform and semantic features from CLIP's Vision encoder, fuses them into a joint representation, and trains progressively in two stages for enhanced performance.

Result: Achieves 91.36% mean accuracy on GenImage, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, 94.96% mean Average Precision, and state-of-the-art results on the challenging Chameleon benchmark. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators.

Conclusion: Integrating spectral and semantic features enables robust, generalized detection of AI-generated images across diverse generators, addressing limitations of existing methods that struggle with high-fidelity content.

Abstract: The fast evolution of generative models has heightened the demand for reliable detection of AI-generated images. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.

TL;DR: ST-MoE: A spatiotemporal mixture of experts model using bidirectional Mamba for efficient multi-person motion prediction with reduced parameters and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-person motion prediction have two main limitations: 1) inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings, and 2) high computational costs from quadratic time complexity of attention mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE) with four distinct spatiotemporal experts that specialize in capturing different spatial/temporal dependencies. Uses bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts to reduce computational overhead while integrating multiple experts efficiently.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in accuracy on four multi-person benchmark datasets, reduces model parameters by 41.38%, and achieves 3.6x speedup in training.

Conclusion: ST-MoE effectively captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion while being computationally efficient, offering a promising solution for multi-person motion prediction tasks.

Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

### [71] [RAPTOR: Real-Time High-Resolution UAV Video Prediction with Efficient Video Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21710)
*Zhan Chen,Zile Guo,Enze Zhu,Peirong Zhang,Xiaoxuan Liu,Lei Wang,Yidan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPTOR is a real-time, high-resolution video prediction architecture that breaks the traditional trilemma between resolution, quality, and speed using efficient spatiotemporal factorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video prediction faces a fundamental trilemma: high-resolution and perceptual quality typically come at the cost of real-time speed, which is critical for latency-sensitive applications like autonomous UAV navigation in dense urban environments. Existing methods fail to meet these demands on edge hardware.

Method: RAPTOR uses a single-pass design to avoid error accumulation from iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling by alternating operations along spatial and temporal axes, reducing complexity from O((ST)²) to O(S+T). It also employs a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp details.

Result: RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for 512² video, setting new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and custom high-resolution datasets in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. It boosts mission success rate in real-world UAV navigation by 18%.

Conclusion: RAPTOR breaks the long-standing trade-off in video prediction, enabling real-time, high-resolution performance that paves the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents, particularly for autonomous UAV applications.

Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18/%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AstraNav-World: An end-to-end world model that jointly predicts future visual states and action sequences in a unified probabilistic framework for embodied navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments requires accurate foresight of world evolution and action sequences. Current approaches often use decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines that suffer from cumulative errors.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based video generator with vision-language policy in unified probabilistic framework. Uses synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions update simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on predicted visuals.

Result: Improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks. Demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities in real-world testing, adapting to unseen scenarios without fine-tuning. Ablations confirmed necessity of tight vision-action coupling.

Conclusion: AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics rather than overfitting to simulation data. Unifying foresight vision and control moves toward reliable, interpretable, general-purpose embodied agents for open-ended real-world settings.

Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.

*Steven Xiao,XIndi Zhang,Dechao Meng,Qi Wang,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Knot Forcing is a streaming framework for real-time portrait animation that addresses error accumulation and motion discontinuities in autoregressive video generation through chunk-wise generation with KV caching, temporal knot modules for smooth transitions, and a "running ahead" mechanism for long-term coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time portrait animation needs high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control for interactive applications. Diffusion models have quality but aren't causal for streaming, while autoregressive approaches suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency.

Method: Three key designs: (1) chunk-wise generation with global identity preservation via cached KV states of reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning; (3) "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference to keep semantic context ahead of current rollout frame.

Result: Enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences with real-time performance and strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Conclusion: Knot Forcing addresses key challenges in streaming portrait animation by combining chunk-wise generation with temporal smoothing mechanisms and long-term coherence preservation, making it suitable for real-time interactive applications.

Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncAnyone: A two-stage diffusion framework for high-quality AI video dubbing that achieves accurate lip-sync while preserving facial structure and background consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based training methods for video dubbing disrupt spatiotemporal context, causing instability in facial structure and background consistency despite achieving lip-sync accuracy.

Method: Two-stage learning framework: Stage 1 trains a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting to generate audio-driven lip movements. Stage 2 uses mask-free tuning with synthetic data from pseudo-paired training samples to address mask-induced artifacts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation in in-the-wild lip-syncing scenarios.

Conclusion: SyncAnyone overcomes limitations of mask-based approaches by combining accurate motion modeling with high visual fidelity through a novel two-stage framework.

Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.

TL;DR: A-QCF-Net learns unified segmentation from unpaired CT/MRI data using quaternion networks and adaptive cross-fusion for bidirectional knowledge transfer, outperforming unimodal baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information but deep learning development is limited by scarcity of large paired/aligned datasets. Need to leverage separate unpaired CT and MRI cohorts that are common in healthcare archives.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) with quaternion neural networks for parameter efficiency and expressive power. Core is Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block - a data-driven attention module enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer between CT and MRI streams, dynamically modulating information flow to exchange modality-specific expertise.

Result: Jointly trained on unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. Achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, exceeding unimodal nnU-Net baseline by 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Explainability analysis with Grad-CAM/Grad-CAM++ confirms model focuses on relevant pathological structures.

Conclusion: Provides robust and clinically viable paradigm for leveraging large unpaired imaging archives common in healthcare, enabling knowledge transfer between modalities without requiring paired data.

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BertsWin: A hybrid SSL architecture combining BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows for 3D medical imaging, achieving 5.8x faster convergence and 15x reduction in training epochs compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE) struggle with 3D volumetric medical images due to difficulty capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships when 75% of tokens are discarded, and ViTs have quadratic complexity issues in 3D.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows, maintaining complete 3D token grid (masked+visible) to preserve spatial topology. Uses single-level local Swin windows to reduce complexity, structural priority loss function, and GradientConductor optimizer.

Result: 5.8x faster semantic convergence, 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660), achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on TMJ cone beam CT scans. Maintains FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines despite dense processing.

Conclusion: BertsWin enables efficient 3D SSL pre-training by preserving complete spatial topology while avoiding computational penalties, making it practical for volumetric medical imaging applications.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

*Jingbo Yang,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a VAE-GAN hybrid video generator with a Markov chain framework to generate long, temporally consistent videos of hundreds/thousands of frames, overcoming quality degradation in existing methods when scaling video length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Networks) struggle with temporal scaling - they can only generate short sequences (up to 16 frames) and quality degrades significantly when trying to generate longer videos. There's a need for models that can generate long videos while maintaining temporal continuity, consistency, and dynamics.

Method: 1. Proposes a VAE-GAN hybrid structure combining adversarial generation with variational encoding for inference capabilities. 2. Uses two processing branches (content and movement). 3. Extends this with a Markov chain framework where each state represents a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. 4. Implements a recall mechanism to sequentially connect generated video sub-sequences while maintaining temporal dependencies.

Result: The proposed approach enables generation of long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames while ensuring temporal continuity, consistency, and dynamics - overcoming the quality degradation problem of classical approaches when scaling video length.

Conclusion: The memory-efficient Markov chain framework with recall mechanism successfully extends video generation capabilities to long sequences, addressing a key limitation in current video generation models and enabling meaningful long video sequences with proper temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scene-VLM is a fine-tuned vision-language model for video scene segmentation that jointly processes visual and textual cues, achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over previous methods, and provides explainable rationales for boundary decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder-based methods for video scene segmentation have several limitations: they are visually biased, process shots in isolation without considering sequential dependencies, lack narrative understanding, and are not explainable. There's a need for a multimodal approach that can leverage both visual and textual information while understanding temporal context.

Method: Scene-VLM is a fine-tuned vision-language model framework that jointly processes visual frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata. It uses sequential processing with causal dependencies among shots and a context-focus window mechanism to provide sufficient temporal context. The model extracts confidence scores from token-level logits for precision-recall trade-offs and can generate natural-language rationales for boundary decisions through targeted supervision.

Result: Scene-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, it shows significant improvements of +6 AP (Average Precision) and +13.7 F1 score over the previous leading method.

Conclusion: Scene-VLM demonstrates that fine-tuned vision-language models can effectively address video scene segmentation by leveraging multimodal reasoning, sequential dependencies, and explainable decision-making, outperforming previous encoder-based approaches while providing interpretable results.

Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

TL;DR: InstructMoLE improves multi-conditional DiT fine-tuning by replacing token-level routing with global instruction-guided routing and adding orthogonality loss for better expert diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for Diffusion Transformers suffer from task interference with monolithic adapters like LoRA, while MoLE architectures with token-level routing cause spatial fragmentation and semantic drift due to conflicts with global user instructions.

Method: Introduces InstructMoLE with Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR) that uses global instruction signals to select a coherent expert council applied uniformly across all tokens, plus an output-space orthogonality loss to promote expert functional diversity and prevent representational collapse.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks, achieving superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Conclusion: InstructMoLE provides a robust, generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models that preserves global semantics and structural integrity while enabling better multi-conditional generation.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

TL;DR: Diffusion posterior sampling for single-image super-resolution achieves best reconstruction at PS scale 0.95 with σ=0.01 noise, balancing diffusion priors and measurement consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study diffusion posterior sampling for single-image super-resolution under known degradation models without retraining diffusion models for each operator.

Method: Likelihood-guided sampling combining unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning for measurement consistency in 4× super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise.

Result: Best configuration achieved at PS scale 0.95 and noise σ=0.01 (score 1.45231), restoring sharper edges and coherent facial details compared to downsampled inputs.

Conclusion: Balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength is crucial for stable, high-quality reconstructions without operator-specific retraining.

Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $σ=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.

Conclusion: CellMamba provides an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection, validated as a lightweight yet accurate one-stage detector for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.

TL;DR: Using CNN on multivariate raw market data (including stock splits/dividends) to predict S&P 500 stock movements, treating historical data matrices as images for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mathematical approaches dominate algorithmic trading, but recent neural network successes show promise. Most existing research uses simplified single-dimension financial data, lacking real-world complexity. Need to handle raw multivariate market data including corporate events like splits/dividends.

Method: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on multivariate raw market data. Treats multi-dimensional stock numbers as historical data matrices (like images). Processes data "as-is" including stock split/dividend events without engineering. Can predict at individual stock, sector, or portfolio levels.

Result: Model achieves promising results in predicting stock movements, demonstrating CNN's effectiveness on raw financial data treated as image-like structures.

Conclusion: CNN can successfully predict S&P 500 movements using raw multivariate data, including complex corporate events. This approach handles real-world financial data complexity better than previous simplified methods, opening new directions for financial prediction research.

Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.

*Mengqi He,Xinyu Tian,Xin Shen,Jinhong Ni,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Selective adversarial attacks targeting only high-entropy tokens (critical decision points) achieve comparable semantic degradation to global attacks with smaller budgets, while exposing significant safety vulnerabilities in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and prior entropy-based attacks treat all tokens equally. The authors discovered that only about 20% of high-entropy tokens disproportionately control output trajectories, suggesting more efficient attack strategies.

Method: Proposed Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA) that concentrate adversarial perturbations on critical high-entropy decision points rather than all tokens, enabling selective attacks with smaller budgets.

Result: Selective attacks achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods with smaller budgets, convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, show transferability across diverse VLMs (17-26% harmful rates), and EGA achieves 93-95% attack success rates.

Conclusion: Critical decision points in autoregressive generation are vulnerable attack surfaces, and selective entropy-based attacks reveal new weaknesses in VLM safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for more robust defenses.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: XET-V2X effectively addresses V2X perception challenges through unified multi-modal fusion in shared spatiotemporal representation, demonstrating practical value for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Multi-view cooperative perception and multimodal fusion are essential for reliable 3D spatiotemporal understanding in autonomous driving, especially under occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios. This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention. Multi-view image features are first aggregated to enhance semantic consistency, followed by point cloud fusion guided by the updated spatial queries, enabling effective cross-modal interaction while reducing computational overhead. Experiments on the real-world V2X-Seq-SPD dataset and the simulated V2X-Sim-V2V and V2X-Sim-V2I benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in detection and tracking performance under varying communication delays. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations indicate that XET-V2X achieves robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic scenarios.

TL;DR: SCL-PNC is a scalable class-incremental learning method that uses parametric neural collapse to enable demand-driven backbone expansion with dynamic ETF classifiers and knowledge distillation to maintain feature consistency across modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incremental learning methods freeze old model parameters but ignore structural efficiency issues, leading to feature differences between modules and class misalignment due to evolving class distributions in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes SCL-PNC with: 1) demand-driven minimal-cost backbone expansion via adapt-layer, 2) dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework that evolves with incremental classes, 3) parallel expansion framework with knowledge distillation to align features across modules and counteract feature drift.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling model expansion with increasing categories in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: SCL-PNC successfully addresses class misalignment and feature consistency issues in incremental learning by leveraging neural collapse principles with an expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and dynamic parametric ETF classifier.

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TPS-SCL, a lightweight RGB-T salient object detection method for real-world unaligned image pairs, using MobileViT encoder with Mamba scanning, semantic correlation constraints, thin-plate spline alignment, and cross-modal correlation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-T SOD methods rely on manually aligned datasets and fail in real-world scenarios with unaligned image pairs due to spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts. Performance deteriorates significantly on unaligned data.

Method: Uses dual-stream MobileViT encoder with Mamba scanning mechanisms for efficient cross-modal correlation modeling. Includes Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to suppress background interference, Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) for spatial alignment, and Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) for inter-modal dependency integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches across various datasets.

Conclusion: TPS-SCL effectively addresses real-world unaligned RGB-T SOD challenges with efficient architecture design, achieving superior performance with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Existing RGB-T salient object detection methods predominantly rely on manually aligned and annotated datasets, struggling to handle real-world scenarios with raw, unaligned RGB-T image pairs. In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADT-Tree accelerates autoregressive image generation by dynamically adjusting draft tree structure based on spatial prediction difficulty, achieving 3x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow sequential inference. While speculative decoding works well for LLMs, it underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty across different image regions.

Method: Proposes Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree) that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width using adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. It initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width through bisectional adaptation, creating deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones.

Result: Empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate speedups of 3.13x and 3.05x respectively. ADT-Tree also integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods like LANTERN for further acceleration.

Conclusion: ADT-Tree effectively addresses the spatial prediction difficulty problem in visual AR models, enabling significant inference acceleration while maintaining quality, with potential for further speedup through integration with relaxed sampling techniques.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIOR is a training-free method that uses large vision-language models to generate conditional image embeddings by prompting them to describe images with single words related to specific conditions, outperforming existing baselines including CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models like CLIP provide rich image representations but aren't designed to focus on specific conditional aspects (e.g., color, genre) indicated by textual conditions. There's a need for methods that can generate embeddings focusing on particular image attributes without requiring additional training.

Method: DIOR leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) in a training-free approach. It prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition, then extracts the hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token as the conditional image embedding. This approach works with any image and condition without task-specific priors.

Result: DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines including CLIP on conditional image similarity tasks. It also achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

Conclusion: DIOR provides a versatile, training-free solution for generating conditional image embeddings that can focus on specific aspects of images as indicated by textual conditions, demonstrating strong performance across various settings without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Feature-level fusion of CNN backbones improves binary diabetic retinopathy screening accuracy across heterogeneous datasets, with EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 fusion achieving best performance (82.89% accuracy) while maintaining practical latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of preventable blindness, but large-scale screening faces challenges due to limited specialist availability and variable image quality across different devices and populations. There's a need for accurate and efficient automated screening methods that can generalize across diverse datasets.

Method: The study investigates feature-level fusion of complementary CNN backbones for binary DR classification. Using 11,156 fundus images from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, ODIR), they compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. The approach frames DR detection as binary classification and evaluates performance across five independent runs.

Result: Fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 fusion model achieves best overall mean performance with 82.89% accuracy and balanced F1-scores (normal: 83.60%, diabetic: 82.60%). While tri-fusion is competitive, it has substantially higher computational cost. EfficientNet-B0 is fastest (1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), while Eff+Den fusion offers favorable accuracy-latency balance.

Conclusion: Lightweight feature fusion enhances generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical. The approach offers practical trade-offs between computational efficiency and screening performance.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

*Yihan Hu,Xuelin Chen,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EasyOmnimatte: A unified end-to-end video omnimatte method that finetunes a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model with dual complementary experts (Effect Expert and Quality Expert) for high-quality foreground layer decomposition with associated effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video omnimatte methods rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. The authors recognize that if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove foreground effects, it should also be capable of perceiving and decomposing them.

Method: Finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model with two complementary experts: 1) Effect Expert with LoRA applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture coarse foreground structure and associated effects, and 2) Quality Expert with full LoRA finetuning to refine alpha mattes. During sampling, Effect Expert handles early high-noise steps while Quality Expert takes over at later low-noise steps.

Result: EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency. The Dual-Expert strategy is validated through ablation studies, and the method enables various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed EasyOmnimatte provides a unified, end-to-end solution for video omnimatte that effectively captures both foreground layers and their associated effects while maintaining computational efficiency through the novel Dual-Expert strategy.

Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPAR is a decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into variable-sized patches using entropy-based token merging, reducing computational costs while improving image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoder-only autoregressive image generation suffers from quadratic growth in token counts with resolution, increasing computational and memory demands. Fixed-length tokenization schemes are inefficient as they treat all image regions equally regardless of information content.

Method: DPAR uses next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight unsupervised autoregressive model to determine which tokens to merge into larger patches based on information content. It dynamically aggregates tokens into variable-sized patches during training and inference, with minimal architectural modifications to standard decoders.

Result: DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x (Imagenet 256) and 2.06x (Imagenet 384), cutting FLOPs by up to 40% in training. It achieves faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baselines. The method also enables scaling to larger patch sizes at inference due to patch boundary robustness.

Conclusion: DPAR demonstrates that entropy-based dynamic token aggregation effectively reduces computational costs while improving image generation quality in decoder-only autoregressive models, maintaining compatibility with multimodal frameworks and allocating compute more efficiently to high-information regions.

Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

*Mo Wang,Junfeng Xia,Wenhao Ye,Enyu Liu,Kaining Peng,Jianfeng Feng,Quanying Liu,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIM-Brain is a new fMRI foundation model that improves both data- and training-efficiency through a two-stage adaptive design with temporal saliency selection and 4D hierarchical encoding, achieving SOTA performance with only 4k pre-training sessions and 30% GPU memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI foundation models face dual bottlenecks: atlas-based methods lose spatial details and need large cohorts, while atlas-free methods preserve spatial fidelity but are too memory/compute-intensive for large-scale pre-training.

Method: Two-stage adaptive design: (1) lightweight temporal extractor captures global context and ranks data windows by saliency, (2) 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from top-k selected windows while deleting ~70% masked patches.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across seven public benchmarks while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory compared to traditional voxel-level methods.

Conclusion: SLIM-Brain successfully addresses the dual efficiency bottlenecks in fMRI foundation models, enabling effective atlas-free modeling with significantly reduced data and computational requirements.

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

TL;DR: Reloc-VGGT: A novel visual localization framework using early-fusion multi-view spatial integration with VGGT backbone, pose tokenizer, and sparse mask attention for real-time robust pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual localization uses late-fusion of pairwise pose estimates, which is insufficient for spatial integration and degrades in complex environments. Need for more effective multi-view spatial integration.

Method: 1) Early-fusion mechanism for multi-view spatial integration; 2) VGGT backbone encoding multi-view 3D geometry; 3) Pose tokenizer and projection module for better spatial relationship exploitation; 4) Sparse mask attention strategy to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear.

Result: Trained on ~8M posed image pairs, demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets validate effectiveness and efficiency, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real-time with robustness to unseen environments.

Conclusion: Reloc-VGGT is the first visual localization framework with early-fusion multi-view spatial integration, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments with real-time performance at scale.

Abstract: Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with long-duration video generation and lack fine-grained facial/hand detail synthesis, limiting real-world high-quality applications.

Method: Proposes a DiT-based framework with: 1) hybrid implicit guidance signals + sharpness guidance for facial/hand details, 2) Position Shift Adaptive Module for arbitrary-length videos, 3) data augmentation + skeleton alignment for identity shape variations.

Result: Outperforms existing SOTA approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in long-duration video generation and fine-grained detail synthesis for human animation applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton data suffer from inherent heterogeneity between modalities and fail to fully exploit their complementary potential. There's a need for better alignment between RGB and skeleton representations for more effective fusion.

Method: Proposes PAN framework with human-centric graph representation learning where token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. Includes attention-based post calibration to reduce dependency on high-quality skeletal data. Presents two variants: PAN-Ensemble (dual-path GCNs with late fusion) and PAN-Unified (unified graph representation learning in single network).

Result: Both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art performance on three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets in their respective settings (separate and unified modeling).

Conclusion: Human-centric graph modeling effectively suppresses RGB redundancy and aligns well with skeleton methods, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. The framework demonstrates strong performance across different fusion strategies.

Abstract: While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation and optimization of product posters is labor-intensive and resource-consuming. Current methods require human intervention for both design and performance optimization based on online metrics.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generator uses unified design module to integrate background, text, and layout elements, then element rendering module encodes these into condition tokens for controllable poster generation. 2) Optimizer enhances CTR using online feedback, systematically replacing elements for fine-grained comparisons and using Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements.

Result: AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. The work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset for product poster generation/optimization with 1M high-quality posters and user feedback.

Conclusion: AutoPP provides a fully automated solution for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates human intervention while improving performance through data-driven optimization techniques.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised brain MRI lesion detection framework using disentangled representation and edge-to-image restoration to improve generalizability across multi-modality/multi-center data and suppress abnormal residuals in pseudo-healthy image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised anomaly detection methods for brain MRI have limited generalizability across different imaging modalities and centers due to reliance on specific imaging information in training data, and suffer from performance constraints due to abnormal residuals propagating from input images to reconstructed pseudo-healthy images.

Method: Two novel modules: 1) Disentangled representation module that decouples brain MRI into imaging information and imaging-invariant anatomical images using brain anatomical priors and differentiable one-hot encoding for stable disentanglement; 2) Edge-to-image restoration module that reconstructs high-quality pseudo-healthy images by restoring anatomical representation from high-frequency edge information and recoupling with disentangled imaging information.

Result: Outperforms 17 state-of-the-art methods on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in Average Precision (AP) and +13.64% in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current unsupervised methods by improving generalizability across multi-modality/multi-center MRI data and suppressing abnormal residuals, leading to superior lesion detection performance.

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

TL;DR: Proposes DRU framework for low-light enhancement in anime scenery images using data relativistic uncertainty to handle illumination diversity, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the domain gap in low-light enhancement for anime scenery images, which is underexplored compared to natural images/videos, and tackles data scarcity in this niche domain.

Method: Constructs unpaired anime scenery dataset, proposes Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework inspired by Relativistic GAN, quantifies illumination uncertainty using wave-particle duality analogy, and dynamically adjusts objective functions to recalibrate learning under data uncertainty.

Result: DRU framework demonstrates superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond state-of-the-art methods when training EnlightenGAN variants, showing effectiveness of learning from data uncertainty perspective.

Conclusion: The framework exposes a novel paradigm of data-centric learning applicable to visual and language domains, with code made available for further research.

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

TL;DR: Automated method finds compact spectral indices for vegetation classification by generating polynomial combinations of normalized band differences and selecting optimal subsets via feature selection, achieving high accuracy with simple, interpretable indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for automated discovery of compact, illumination-invariant spectral indices for vegetation classification that are simple, interpretable, and deployable in platforms like Google Earth Engine.

Method: Generate all pairwise normalized differences from spectral bands, build polynomial combinations up to fixed degree (degree-2), creating structured search space. Apply feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, L1-regularized SVM) to select optimal small sets of indices.

Result: For Kochia detection using Sentinel-2 imagery: single degree-2 index (product of two normalized differences from red-edge bands) achieves 96.26% accuracy; eight indices achieve 97.70%. Selected features consistently involve degree-2 products from bands b4-b8, indicating discriminative signal comes from spectral interactions.

Conclusion: Automated framework successfully finds compact, interpretable spectral indices that maintain high accuracy. Method is sensor-agnostic, deployable in platforms like Google Earth Engine, and open-source implementation (ndindex) is available for broader application.

Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes noise robustness in medical MLLMs and introduces a training-free framework (IMC) with visual (PDC) and textual (SMS) denoising components to enhance cross-modal robustness against real-world perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MLLMs show promising clinical performance but are sensitive to real-world input perturbations (imaging artifacts, textual errors), which undermines their clinical applicability. Existing robustness studies focus on text modality, rely on costly fine-tuning, and don't address complex medical noise patterns or strict safety standards.

Method: Introduces Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework: 1) Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) for visual modality - uses MLLMs' vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration; 2) Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) for text denoising - exploits MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities through cooperative agent hierarchy. Training-free approach following perceive-and-calibrate principle.

Result: Constructed benchmark with 11 noise types across image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, demonstrating potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed IMC framework effectively enhances medical MLLMs' robustness against real-world perturbations without requiring fine-tuning, addressing critical safety concerns for clinical deployment by leveraging inherent denoising capabilities through cross-modal calibration.

Abstract: Medical Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising clinical performance. However, their sensitivity to real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, critically undermines their clinical applicability. Systematic analysis of such noise impact on medical MLLMs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while several works have investigated the MLLMs' robustness in general domains, they primarily focus on text modality and rely on costly fine-tuning. They are inadequate to address the complex noise patterns and fulfill the strict safety standards in medicine. To bridge this gap, this work systematically analyzes the impact of various perturbations on medical MLLMs across both visual and textual modalities. Building on our findings, we introduce a training-free Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework that leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities following the perceive-and-calibrate principle for cross-modal robustness enhancement. For the visual modality, we propose a Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) which leverages MLLMs' own vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration. For text denoising, we design a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) that exploits the MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities to refine noisy text through a cooperative hierarchy of agents. We construct a benchmark containing 11 types of noise across both image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, showing potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMSF-A is a lightweight multi-scale attention framework for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, achieving high accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs while maintaining stability under small-batch training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is challenging due to narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is constrained by limited surgical hardware, requiring models to balance accuracy and speed while remaining stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training.

Method: Proposes LMSF-A with three key components: 1) Backbone uses C2f-Pro module combining RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution with efficient multi-scale attention for multi-branch training and single-path inference; 2) Neck employs Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion and Triple Feature Encoding to improve cross-scale consistency and boundary details; 3) Head adopts Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head with shared convolutions and GroupNorm for parameter reduction and batch-1 stability.

Result: LMSF-A achieves competitive or superior performance across all evaluation metrics with only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs. It generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark. The authors also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset with 61 patients and 610 images with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve.

Conclusion: LMSF-A provides an effective lightweight solution for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, addressing hardware constraints and surgical challenges while maintaining accuracy and speed. The released PELD dataset facilitates further research in this domain.

Abstract: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

Motivation: Small task-specific vision models are computationally efficient and explainable, but their explanations often reveal they rely on spurious correlations rather than aligning with human domain knowledge, leading to brittle real-world performance.

Method: LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) creates a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model using a Large Vision Language Model.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications on both synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively reducing dependence on spurious features and group-specific biases.

Conclusion: LVLM-VA provides an efficient way to align small vision models with human domain knowledge, addressing the problem of spurious correlations and improving real-world robustness without requiring fine-grained feedback.

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

Motivation: VLMs suffer from persistent hallucination issues due to over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration. Existing heuristic decoding calibration strategies are non-trainable, limiting their optimization potential.

Method: Proposes an Activate-Locate-Edit Adversarially paradigm: 1) Construct activation dataset with grounded vs. hallucinatory responses, 2) Identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters via differential hidden state analysis, 3) Fine-tune clusters using adversarial prompts optimized to maximize visual neglect, forcing visual evidence prioritization.

Result: Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate significant effectiveness in alleviating hallucinations.

Conclusion: ALEAHallu provides an effective parametric editing framework for hallucination mitigation in VLMs, addressing limitations of non-trainable calibration strategies through adversarial optimization.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

*Sarthak Mehrotra,Sairam V C Rebbapragada,Mani Hemanth Reddy Bonthu,Vineeth N Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iSHIFT is a lightweight 2.5B parameter GUI agent that uses implicit chain-of-thought reasoning with perception control to switch between slow (detailed visual grounding) and fast (global cues) modes for efficient and precise interface interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with balancing efficiency for routine GUI tasks and precision for fine-grained interactions that require exact visual grounding. They are also too large and lack adaptive reasoning depth for different task complexities.

Method: iSHIFT integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. It uses special perception tokens to guide attention to relevant screen regions and enables switching between slow mode (detailed visual grounding) and fast mode (global cues).

Result: Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets for GUI interaction tasks.

Conclusion: iSHIFT demonstrates that lightweight agents with adaptive reasoning modes and perception control can achieve both efficiency and precision in GUI interactions, addressing key limitations of current MLLM approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongFly is a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for UAV vision-and-language navigation that improves long-horizon navigation by better modeling historical context and trajectory information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV vision-and-language navigation methods struggle with long-horizon spatiotemporal context modeling in complex post-disaster environments, leading to inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning.

Method: Proposes three key modules: 1) Slot-based historical image compression to distill multi-view observations into fixed-length representations, 2) Spatiotemporal trajectory encoding to capture temporal dynamics and spatial structure, and 3) Prompt-guided multimodal integration to combine context with current observations for time-based reasoning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89% in success rate and 6.33% in success weighted by path length, with consistent performance across both seen and unseen environments.

Conclusion: LongFly effectively addresses long-horizon spatiotemporal context modeling challenges in UAV navigation, providing more accurate semantic alignment and stable path planning for post-disaster search and rescue applications.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI creates highly realistic fake facial images that threaten personal privacy and online information integrity. Existing deepfake detection methods perform well in intra-domain settings but degrade significantly when facing unseen forgery patterns due to reliance on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures.

Method: GenDF transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to deepfake detection with a compact network design.

Result: Extensive experiments show GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in both cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the framework's effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: GenDF provides a simple yet effective solution for deepfake detection that addresses the generalization challenge through transfer learning, feature space redistribution, and parameter-efficient augmentation, making it practical for real-world deployment with limited computational resources.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of highly realistic fake facial images, posing serious threats to personal privacy and the integrity of online information. Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters.

### [109] [Backdoor Attacks on Prompt-Driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22046)
*Zongmin Zhang,Zhen Sun,Yifan Liao,Wenhan Dong,Xinlei He,Xingshuo Han,Shengmin Xu,Xinyi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadVSFM is a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for prompt-driven video segmentation foundation models, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining clean performance, unlike traditional backdoor attacks which fail on these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising security concerns. Traditional backdoor attacks are ineffective on VSFMs (ASR < 5%), creating a need for specialized attacks to understand and address this emerging vulnerability.

Method: BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) Steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a target embedding while clean frames align with a clean reference encoder; (2) Train the mask decoder so triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask across prompt types, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. The attack remains robust to hyperparameter changes and defeats four representative defenses.

Conclusion: BadVSFM reveals a significant vulnerability in current VSFMs by successfully separating triggered and clean representations and shifting attention to trigger regions, demonstrating that conventional backdoor attacks are ineffective while specialized attacks can succeed, highlighting an underexplored security threat.

Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents could revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current approaches face four key challenges: lack of native agent-user interaction, limits of UI-only operation, absence of practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments.

Method: MAI-UI uses a unified methodology with: 1) self-evolving data pipeline expanding navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, 2) native device-cloud collaboration system routing execution by task state, and 3) online RL framework with advanced optimizations for scaling parallel environments and context length.

Online RL scaling shows +5.2 points from 32 to 512 parallel environments and +4.3 points from 15 to 50 environment steps. Device-cloud collaboration improves on-device performance by 33% and reduces cloud calls by 40%.

Conclusion: MAI-UI successfully addresses key GUI agent deployment challenges through its unified methodology, establishing new state-of-the-art performance while enabling practical deployment through device-cloud collaboration that improves efficiency and preserves privacy.

Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based avatar methods are non-causal and computationally expensive, unsuitable for streaming. Current interactive approaches are limited to head-and-shoulder region without full-body gestures.

Method: Two-stage autoregressive adaptation with autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement. Key components: Reference Sink, Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR), and Consistency-Aware Discriminator for long-term stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness. Enables one-shot interactive human avatars with coherent gestures and natural talking/listening behaviors.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully adapts high-fidelity diffusion models for real-time streaming avatars with full-body interaction capabilities, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

Motivation: Current diffusion-based world generation methods have critical limitations: large parameter sizes, slow inference steps, growing historical context issues, and lack of text control, which prevent real-time interactive applications.

Method: Three core components: 1) Long-video generation with unified context compression and linear attention, 2) Real-time streaming acceleration via bidirectional attention distillation and enhanced text embedding, 3) Text-controlled world event generation.

Result: The framework enables realistic, interactive, continuous world generation from single images or text prompts with keyboard-based exploration capabilities and real-time performance.

Conclusion: \method addresses key limitations of existing diffusion-based world generation methods by providing efficient, real-time, text-controlled interactive world generation with practical exploration capabilities.

Abstract: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds. However, most of these methods face critical challenges such as excessively large parameter sizes, reliance on lengthy inference steps, and rapidly growing historical context, which severely limit real-time performance and lack text-controlled generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events.

### [113] [Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105)
*Momir Adžemović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDLP is a tracking-by-detection method that uses link prediction between tracks and detections for per-frame association, learning from data without handcrafted rules while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object tracking has two problematic paradigms: tracking-by-detection methods rely on handcrafted association heuristics, while end-to-end approaches learn association from data but are computationally expensive. There's a need for a method that learns association directly from data while remaining computationally efficient.

Method: TDLP performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. It's architecturally designed primarily for geometric features like bounding boxes, with optional incorporation of additional cues (pose, appearance). Unlike heuristic methods, it learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Analysis reveals link prediction is more effective than metric learning-based association, especially when handling heterogeneous features like detection bounding boxes.

Conclusion: TDLP offers a novel approach that combines the computational efficiency of tracking-by-detection methods with the data-driven learning capability of end-to-end approaches, achieving superior performance through link prediction-based association.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProEdit improves inversion-based visual editing by addressing source information over-reliance through KV-mix attention mechanism and Latents-Shift perturbation, achieving better editing consistency while allowing desired attribute changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based editing methods overly rely on source image information during sampling, which negatively affects editing quality - they often fail to properly change subject attributes like pose, number, or color as instructed.

Method: Two key components: 1) KV-mix in attention aspect - mixes KV features of source and target in edited regions to mitigate source influence while maintaining background consistency; 2) Latents-Shift in latent aspect - perturbs edited region of source latent to eliminate inverted latent influence on sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several image and video editing benchmarks, with plug-and-play design that seamlessly integrates with existing inversion and editing methods like RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

Conclusion: ProEdit effectively addresses the source information over-reliance problem in inversion-based editing through attention and latent modifications, enabling better attribute changes while maintaining editing consistency.

Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS) improves vision-language models by using bidirectional where-to-look signals to shape perception during training, reducing reliance on text-only shortcuts and improving visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs either use external tools or generate latent visual tokens, but these approaches overlook fine-grained visual evidence, generalize poorly across domains, and have high inference costs. There's a need for better visual perception training.

Method: BiPS transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional signals: 1) KL-consistency constraint between original image and evidence-preserving view (keeps only question-relevant regions) for coarse coverage, 2) KL-separation constraint between original and evidence-ablated view (masks critical pixels) to discourage text-only shortcuts and enforce visual reliance.

Result: Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

Conclusion: BiPS effectively shapes visual perception during training, improving model performance and generalization while reducing reliance on text-only reasoning shortcuts.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

Method: A hybrid dual-stream deep learning framework built on teacher-student knowledge distillation, where a high-capacity teacher model combines Swin Transformer (global context) and Vision Transformer (local features), and a compact Tiny-ViT student network inherits knowledge via soft-label distillation.

Result: Achieved remarkable performance with accuracies of 0.9978 and 0.9928 on two Wireless Capsule Endoscopy datasets, average AUC of 1.0000, and interpretability analyses confirmed clinically relevant decision-making. Tiny-ViT maintained comparable performance with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for AI-assisted GI disease diagnosis, suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments and paving the way for intelligent endoscopic screening compatible with clinical practicality.

Abstract: The accurate classification of gastrointestinal diseases from endoscopic and histopathological imagery remains a significant challenge in medical diagnostics, mainly due to the vast data volume and subtle variation in inter-class visuals. This study presents a hybrid dual-stream deep learning framework built on teacher-student knowledge distillation, where a high-capacity teacher model integrates the global contextual reasoning of a Swin Transformer with the local fine-grained feature extraction of a Vision Transformer. The student network was implemented as a compact Tiny-ViT structure that inherits the teacher's semantic and morphological knowledge via soft-label distillation, achieving a balance between efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Two carefully curated Wireless Capsule Endoscopy datasets, encompassing major GI disease classes, were employed to ensure balanced representation and prevent inter-sample bias. The proposed framework achieved remarkable performance with accuracies of 0.9978 and 0.9928 on Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 respectively, and an average AUC of 1.0000, signifying near-perfect discriminative capability. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM, LIME, and Score-CAM confirmed that the model's predictions were grounded in clinically significant tissue regions and pathologically relevant morphological cues, validating the framework's transparency and reliability. The Tiny-ViT demonstrated diagnostic performance with reduced computational complexity comparable to its transformer-based teacher while delivering faster inference, making it suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Overall, the proposed framework provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for AI-assisted GI disease diagnosis, paving the way toward future intelligent endoscopic screening that is compatible with clinical practicality.

### [118] [The Color-Clinical Decoupling: Why Perceptual Calibration Fails Clinical Biomarkers in Smartphone Dermatology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21988)
*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Color calibration reduces color error but fails to ensure reliable clinical biomarker measurements across devices, especially for underrepresented skin phototypes, due to "color-clinical decoupling" and anatomical variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether standard colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability for smartphone-based tele-dermatology, particularly for underrepresented skin phototypes (Fitzpatrick III-IV).

Method: Analyzed 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects using DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. Applied Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization and evaluated color accuracy (Delta E) and biomarker reliability (Individual Typology Angle and Melanin Index).

Result: Color calibration reduced error by 67-77% with near-clinical accuracy (Delta E < 2.3), but biomarker reliability varied: ITA showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC=0.40) while Melanin Index had good agreement (ICC=0.77). Facial region accounted for 25.2% of color variance vs. 7.0% for device effects.

Conclusion: Current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction in mobile dermatology. Region-aware protocols are needed due to "color-clinical decoupling" and significant anatomical variance.

Abstract: Smartphone-based tele-dermatology assumes that colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability, yet this remains untested for underrepresented skin phototypes. We investigated whether standard calibration translates to reliable clinical biomarkers using 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects (Fitzpatrick III-IV) across DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. While Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization reduced color error by 67-77% -- achieving near-clinical accuracy (Delta E < 2.3) -- this success did not translate to biomarker reliability.
  We identify a phenomenon termed "color-clinical decoupling": despite perceptual accuracy, the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC = 0.40), while the Melanin Index achieved good agreement (ICC = 0.77). This decoupling is driven by the ITA formula's sensitivity to b* channel noise and is further compounded by anatomical variance. Facial region accounts for 25.2% of color variance -- 3.6x greater than device effects (7.0%) -- challenging the efficacy of single-patch calibration. Our results demonstrate that current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction, necessitating region-aware protocols for mobile dermatology.

*Sunil Arora,John Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A comprehensive six-phase framework (SC-NLP-LMF) for secure and compliant NLP system lifecycle management in high-risk domains like healthcare and finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP systems in sensitive domains handle personal/regulated data but existing AI governance frameworks don't fully address security, privacy, and compliance risks specific to NLP applications.

Method: Developed through systematic PRISMA-based review of 45 peer-reviewed and regulatory sources; integrates bias detection, differential privacy, federated learning, secure deployment, explainability, and secure decommissioning methods; aligns with NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, EU AI Act, and MITRE ATLAS standards.

Result: Created SC-NLP-LMF framework with six phases covering NLP system lifecycle; demonstrated through healthcare case study showing detection of terminology drift (COVID-related language) and compliant model updates.

Conclusion: SC-NLP-LMF provides organizations with practical, lifecycle-wide structure for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure, accountable NLP systems in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and government, where they handle large volumes of personal and regulated data. However, these systems introduce distinct risks related to security, privacy, and regulatory compliance that are not fully addressed by existing AI governance frameworks. This paper introduces the Secure and Compliant NLP Lifecycle Management Framework (SC-NLP-LMF), a comprehensive six-phase model designed to ensure the secure operation of NLP systems from development to retirement. The framework, developed through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 45 peer-reviewed and regulatory sources, aligns with leading standards, including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the EU AI Act, and MITRE ATLAS. It integrates established methods for bias detection, privacy protection (differential privacy, federated learning), secure deployment, explainability, and secure model decommissioning. A healthcare case study illustrates how SC-NLP-LMF detects emerging terminology drift (e.g., COVID-related language) and guides compliant model updates. The framework offers organizations a practical, lifecycle-wide structure for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure and accountable NLP systems in high-risk environments.

### [120] [Query Carefully: Detecting the Unanswerables in Text-to-SQL Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21345)
*Jasmin Saxer,Isabella Maria Aigner,Luise Linzmeier,Andreas Weiler,Kurt Stockinger*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: A pipeline called Query Carefully that combines LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection of unanswerable queries, specifically for biomedical databases, evaluated on a new dataset of 80 no-answer questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-SQL systems risk generating executable but incorrect SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries, which is particularly dangerous in biomedical contexts where precision is critical.

Method: Uses llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples from both answerable and unanswerable questions. Built on OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark with a new dataset OncoMX-NAQ containing 80 no-answer questions across 8 categories.

Result: On OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples improves result accuracy without degrading performance when adding unanswerable examples. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves 0.8 unanswerable-detection accuracy, with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories but challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3).

Conclusion: The Query Carefully pipeline with explicit unanswerable detection and a lightweight user interface supports transparent and reliable text-to-SQL in biomedical applications, addressing critical safety concerns in precision-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems allow non-SQL experts to interact with relational databases using natural language. However, their tendency to generate executable SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries introduces a hidden risk, as outputs may be misinterpreted as correct. This risk is especially serious in biomedical contexts, where precision is critical. We therefore present Query Carefully, a pipeline that integrates LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection and handling of unanswerable inputs. Building on the OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark, we construct OncoMX-NAQ (No-Answer Questions), a set of 80 no-answer questions spanning 8 categories (non-SQL, out-of-schema/domain, and multiple ambiguity types). Our approach employs llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples drawn from both answerable and unanswerable questions. We evaluate SQL exact match, result accuracy, and unanswerable-detection accuracy. On the OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples increases result accuracy, and adding unanswerable examples does not degrade performance. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves the highest unanswerable-detection accuracy (0.8), with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories (non-SQL, missing columns, out-of-domain) but persistent challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3). A lightweight user interface surfaces interim SQL, execution results, and abstentions, supporting transparent and reliable text-to-SQL in biomedical applications.

*Aiwei Zhang,Arvind Pillai,Andrew Campbell,Nicholas C. Jacobson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MotionTeller is a framework that generates natural language summaries from wearable actigraphy data by integrating a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a frozen LLM decoder via a projection module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As wearable sensing becomes pervasive, there's a need to transform raw physiological signals (like actigraphy) into natural language summaries for better human interpretation and application in behavioral monitoring and healthcare.

Method: Combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM. Trained on 54,383 (actigraphy, text) pairs from NHANES using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on language tokens.

Result: Achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7% in ROUGE-1. Training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15. Qualitative analysis shows capture of circadian structure and behavioral transitions.

Conclusion: MotionTeller is a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, enabling new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.

Abstract: As wearable sensing becomes increasingly pervasive, a key challenge remains: how can we generate natural language summaries from raw physiological signals such as actigraphy - minute-level movement data collected via accelerometers? In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training. Together, these results position MotionTeller as a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, introducing new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.

### [122] [Perplexity-Aware Data Scaling Law: Perplexity Landscapes Predict Performance for Continual Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21515)
*Lei Liu,Hao Zhu,Yue Shen,Zhixuan Chu,Jian Wang,Jinjie Gu,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a perplexity-aware data scaling law for continual pre-training that uses model perplexity on domain data to identify high-utility training subsets, improving data efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual pre-training approaches suffer from diminishing returns when simply scaling up data, leading to suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. The standard scaling laws don't account for the informational value of domain-specific data.

Method: Develops a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law that establishes a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and test loss. Uses pre-trained model perplexity on domain data as a proxy for estimating knowledge gap, quantifying the informational perplexity landscape to enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed perplexity-aware scaling law provides an effective framework for data-efficient continual pre-training by prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise, addressing the limitations of traditional data scaling approaches.

Abstract: Continual Pre-training (CPT) serves as a fundamental approach for adapting foundation models to domain-specific applications. Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM. However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks.

### [123] [An Information Theoretic Perspective on Agentic System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21720)
*Shizhe He,Avanika Narayan,Ishan S. Khare,Scott W. Linderman,Christopher Ré,Dan Biderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic LM systems use smaller "compressor" LMs to distill context into compact text for larger "predictor" LMs. The paper introduces an information-theoretic framework using mutual information to quantify compression quality, showing it strongly predicts downstream performance independent of specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compressor-predictor systems in agentic LM applications are designed ad hoc without systematic guidance. There's a need for task-independent metrics to evaluate compression quality and understand how compressor/predictor choices affect performance, avoiding costly task-specific evaluations.

Method: The paper treats compressor LMs as noisy channels and introduces a mutual information estimator between context and its compression to quantify compression quality. It conducts comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families using this information-theoretic framework.

Result: Mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance independent of specific tasks. Larger compressors are more accurate, token-efficient, and convey more bits of information per token. Scaling compressors is more effective than scaling predictors, enabling on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic framework provides systematic guidance for designing compressor-predictor systems. Larger compressors offer better performance and efficiency, enabling cost-effective deployments where local compressors can achieve near-frontier accuracy at significantly reduced API costs.

Abstract: Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\times$ more accurate, $4.6\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\%$ of API costs.

### [124] [Unifying Learning Dynamics and Generalization in Transformers Scaling Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22088)
*Chiwun Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for LLM scaling laws by analyzing transformer training dynamics as an ODE system, revealing a phase transition in generalization error decay from exponential to power-law as computational resources increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While scaling laws are empirically validated for LLMs, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. The paper aims to provide rigorous theoretical analysis of how transformer-based language models learn and generalize under realistic training conditions.

Method: Formalizes transformer learning dynamics as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, approximates the process to kernel behaviors, and rigorously analyzes stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution.

Result: Establishes a theoretical upper bound on excess risk with a distinct phase transition: initial exponential decay of excess risk relative to computational cost, followed by a statistical phase with power-law decay of Θ(C^{-1/6}). Also derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding scaling laws, explaining the phase transition behavior in generalization error and how different computational resources independently govern generalization bounds, offering deeper theoretical insights into LLM training dynamics.

Abstract: The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.
  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents for data science pipelines struggle with generating insightful, diverse visual evidence and assembling it into coherent, professional reports, creating a gap in automated end-to-end data analysis.

Method: Two-part multi-agent pipeline: 1) Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes visualization directions, generates/executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures, and scores insights for depth, correctness, specificity, and actionability. 2) Presenter orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from top insights, writes transitions, and revises for clarity.

Conclusion: By coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

Abstract: Automating end-to-end data science pipeline with AI agents still stalls on two gaps: generating insightful, diverse visual evidence and assembling it into a coherent, professional report. We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

*Wenyuan Yang,Jie Xu,Hongqing He,Jiangzhang Gan,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeEIC: A missing-pattern tree framework for incomplete multi-view clustering that fully utilizes available multi-view pairs by grouping data by missing patterns, performing clustering within each set, and using ensemble knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data has highly inconsistent missing patterns that challenge incomplete multi-view clustering. Existing methods overlook the "pair under-utilization" issue where inconsistent missing patterns prevent full utilization of available multi-view pairs, limiting model performance.

Method: 1) Defines missing-pattern tree model to group data into decision sets by missing patterns and performs clustering within each set. 2) Multi-view decision ensemble module aggregates results from all sets using uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable decisions. 3) Ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation transfers ensemble knowledge to view-specific models, optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

Conclusion: TreeEIC effectively addresses the pair under-utilization problem in incomplete multi-view clustering by fully exploiting available multi-view pairs through missing-pattern grouping, ensemble decision making, and knowledge distillation, resulting in robust and superior performance.

Abstract: Real-world multi-view data usually exhibits highly inconsistent missing patterns which challenges the effectiveness of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

*Hongqing He,Jie Xu,Wenyuan Yang,Yonghua Zhu,Guoqiu Wen,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified contrastive learning framework for multi-view clustering that addresses rare-paired and mis-paired issues in incomplete/noisy multi-view data using global-graph and local-graph guided contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data often suffers from incompleteness and noise, leading to rare-paired samples (insufficient complementary information) and mis-paired samples (wrong optimization direction), which challenge the effectiveness of contrastive learning for multi-view clustering.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with two key components: 1) Global-graph guided contrastive learning that constructs a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for exploring complementary information, and 2) Local-graph weighted contrastive learning that uses local neighbors to generate adaptive pair-wise weights to strengthen or weaken contrastive learning. The method is imputation-free.

Result: Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework effectively addresses rare-paired and mis-paired issues in incomplete and noisy multi-view data, enhancing clustering effectiveness without requiring data imputation.

Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL) plays an important role in exploring complementary information for multi-view clustering (MVC) and has attracted increasing attention. Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tree-based methods like XGBoost outperform deep learning models on imbalanced clinical data, offering better robustness and computational efficiency for emergency care applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency and intensive care settings need accurate, computationally efficient predictive models, but clinical data is often severely imbalanced, undermining model reliability for rare but crucial outcomes. Robustness and scalability are essential for real-world clinical usage.

Method: Systematically evaluated robustness and scalability of classical ML models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU datasets. Compared tree-based methods, TabNet deep learning model, and custom lightweight TabResNet (streamlined residual network alternative to TabNet). Used Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability across seven clinically vital predictive tasks.

Result: Tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs. TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks.

Conclusion: In emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, providing a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, yet clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

*Hengyi Wu,Zhenyi Wang,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an entropy-aware continual learning method that dynamically regulates layer entropy to balance underfitting and overfitting, improving generalization by converging to wider local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most continual learning methods treat all layers uniformly, leading to stability-plasticity trade-offs. Different layers naturally exhibit varying uncertainty levels (entropy) when classifying tasks, with high-entropy layers underfitting and low-entropy layers overfitting.

Method: Uses a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy - reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This encourages convergence to wider local minima for better generalization.

Result: Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.

Conclusion: The entropy-aware approach effectively addresses the imbalance in layer uncertainty, improves continual learning performance, and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based methods.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned ones, but most methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.

*Liuyang Bai,Weiyi Lu,Li Guo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SemDAC: A semantic-aware neural audio codec that uses semantic codebooks from HuBERT features for efficient speech compression, achieving better quality and lower bitrates than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech codecs optimize for waveform fidelity, wasting bits on acoustic details that can be inferred from linguistic structure, leading to inefficient compression and poor performance on downstream recognition tasks.

Method: SemDAC uses a residual vector quantization (RVQ) stack where the first quantizer is distilled from HuBERT features to produce semantic tokens capturing phonetic content, while subsequent quantizers model residual acoustics. A FiLM-conditioned decoder reconstructs audio conditioned on semantic tokens.

Result: SemDAC outperforms DAC across perceptual metrics and achieves lower WER when running Whisper on reconstructed speech, while operating at substantially lower bitrates (0.95 kbps vs. 2.5 kbps for DAC).

Conclusion: Semantic codebooks provide an effective inductive bias for neural speech compression, producing compact yet recognition-friendly representations that bridge the gap between compression efficiency and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Speech codecs are traditionally optimized for waveform fidelity, allocating bits to preserve acoustic detail even when much of it can be inferred from linguistic structure. This leads to inefficient compression and suboptimal performance on downstream recognition tasks. We propose SemDAC, a semantic-aware neural audio codec that leverages semantic codebooks as effective priors for speech compression. In SemDAC, the first quantizer in a residual vector quantization (RVQ) stack is distilled from HuBERT features to produce semantic tokens that capture phonetic content, while subsequent quantizers model residual acoustics. A FiLM-conditioned decoder reconstructs audio conditioned on the semantic tokens, improving efficiency in the use of acoustic codebooks. Despite its simplicity, this design proves highly effective: SemDAC outperforms DAC across perceptual metrics and achieves lower WER when running Whisper on reconstructed speech, all while operating at substantially lower bitrates (e.g., 0.95 kbps vs. 2.5 kbps for DAC). These results demonstrate that semantic codebooks provide an effective inductive bias for neural speech compression, producing compact yet recognition-friendly representations.

### [131] [Residual Prior Diffusion: A Probabilistic Framework Integrating Coarse Latent Priors with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21593)
*Takuro Kutsuna*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: RPD is a two-stage diffusion framework that uses a coarse prior model to capture large-scale structure, then trains a diffusion model on the residual between prior and target distribution, improving handling of multi-scale data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models struggle when data has mismatched scales (global structure vs fine details), as a single network must represent both. This occurs in natural images (coarse structure vs textures) and low-dimensional distributions with concentrated local structure.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Coarse prior model captures large-scale data structure, 2) Diffusion model trained on residual between prior and target distribution. Formulated as probabilistic model with tractable ELBO, reduces to noise/velocity prediction. Introduces auxiliary variables leveraging prior information to simplify prediction.

Result: On synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure, standard diffusion fails to capture local details while RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving large-scale structure. On natural image generation, RPD matches or exceeds baseline diffusion models and maintains strong performance with few inference steps.

Conclusion: RPD effectively addresses scale mismatch in diffusion models by separating coarse and fine structure learning, improving both synthetic and natural image generation while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a central tool in deep generative modeling, but standard formulations rely on a single network and a single diffusion schedule to transform a simple prior, typically a standard normal distribution, into the target data distribution. As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps.

TL;DR: Modified TSception architecture improves EEG-based driver drowsiness detection with better stability and cross-task generalization compared to original TSception and other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver drowsiness is a major cause of traffic accidents, requiring real-time, reliable detection systems for road safety. Existing EEG-based methods need improvements in stability and generalizability.

Method: Modified TSception architecture with five-layer temporal refinement strategy, Adaptive Average Pooling for handling varying EEG input dimensions, and two-stage fusion mechanism for optimizing spatiotemporal feature integration.

Result: Achieves 83.46% accuracy on SEED-VIG dataset (comparable to original TSception's 83.15%) but with significantly reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), indicating better stability. On STEW mental workload dataset, achieves state-of-the-art 95.93% (2-class) and 95.35% (3-class) accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed modifications effectively improve consistency and cross-task generalizability for reliable EEG-based monitoring of drowsiness and mental workload, making it more suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness remains a primary cause of traffic accidents, necessitating the development of real-time, reliable detection systems to ensure road safety. This study presents a Modified TSception architecture designed for the robust assessment of driver fatigue using Electroencephalography (EEG). The model introduces a novel hierarchical architecture that surpasses the original TSception by implementing a five-layer temporal refinement strategy to capture multi-scale brain dynamics. A key innovation is the use of Adaptive Average Pooling, which provides the structural flexibility to handle varying EEG input dimensions, and a two - stage fusion mechanism that optimizes the integration of spatiotemporal features for improved stability. When evaluated on the SEED-VIG dataset and compared against established methods - including SVM, Transformer, EEGNet, ConvNeXt, LMDA-Net, and the original TSception - the Modified TSception achieves a comparable accuracy of 83.46% (vs. 83.15% for the original). Critically, the proposed model exhibits a substantially reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), signifying a marked improvement in performance stability. Furthermore, the architecture's generalizability is validated on the STEW mental workload dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results with 95.93% and 95.35% accuracy for 2-class and 3-class classification, respectively. These improvements in consistency and cross-task generalizability underscore the effectiveness of the proposed modifications for reliable EEG-based monitoring of drowsiness and mental workload.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VR content creation requires complex modeling tools or predefined assets, creating barriers for non-expert users who want to create physically realistic content.

Method: Combines two complementary inputs: sketches capture object structure and spatial arrangement, while gestures convey physical cues like velocity, direction, and force to define movement and behavior.

Result: Enables generation of complex physical phenomena (rigid body motion, elastic deformation, cloth dynamics) with significant advantages in expressiveness and user experience compared to text-driven methods.

Conclusion: SketchPlay lowers entry barriers for non-experts and shows strong potential for applications in education, art, and immersive storytelling through its intuitive, engaging creation process.

Abstract: Creating physically realistic content in VR often requires complex modeling tools or predefined 3D models, textures, and animations, which present significant barriers for non-expert users. In this paper, we propose SketchPlay, a novel VR interaction framework that transforms humans' air-drawn sketches and gestures into dynamic, physically realistic scenes, making content creation intuitive and playful like drawing. Specifically, sketches capture the structure and spatial arrangement of objects and scenes, while gestures convey physical cues such as velocity, direction, and force that define movement and behavior. By combining these complementary forms of input, SketchPlay captures both the structure and dynamics of user-created content, enabling the generation of a wide range of complex physical phenomena, such as rigid body motion, elastic deformation, and cloth dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional text-driven methods, SketchPlay offers significant advantages in expressiveness, and user experience. By providing an intuitive and engaging creation process, SketchPlay lowers the entry barrier for non-expert users and shows strong potential for applications in education, art, and immersive storytelling.
