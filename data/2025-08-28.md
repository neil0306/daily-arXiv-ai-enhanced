### [1] [MultiPL-MoE: Multi-Programming-Lingual Extension of Large Language Models through Hybrid Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19268)
*Qing Wang,Xue Han,Jiahui Wang,Lehao Xing,Qian Hu,Lianlian Zhang,Chao Deng,Junlan Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiPL-MoE: A hybrid mixture of experts approach that improves multilingual code generation in LLMs using token-level and segment-level MoE with innovative routing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' strong code creation capabilities, multilingual code generation remains challenging. The paper aims to improve multi-programming-lingual performance while maintaining performance on popular languages with limited computational resources.

Method: Proposes MultiPL-MoE, combining two paired MoEs: token-level MoE with shared expert and novel gate weight normalization, and segment-level MoE with sliding window segmentation and expert-choice routing strategy where experts select top-k segments.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE in improving multilingual code generation performance.

Conclusion: The hybrid MoE approach successfully addresses multilingual code generation challenges by optimizing expert selection at both token and segment levels, capturing programming language syntax and contextual patterns effectively.

Abstract: Despite LLMs' excellent code creation capabilities, multilingual code
generation remains extremely challenging. To address this, we intent to improve
the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while
retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We
consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose
a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called
MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize
expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a
standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight
normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level
MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better
capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming
languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence
into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that
allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment
proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.

### [2] [Whisper based Cross-Lingual Phoneme Recognition between Vietnamese and English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19270)
*Nguyen Huu Nhat Minh,Tran Nguyen Anh,Truong Dinh Dung,Vo Van Nam,Le Pham Tuyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel bilingual speech recognition approach for Vietnamese-English mixing that constructs a bilingual phoneme set and uses PhoWhisper encoder to improve cross-lingual phoneme recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of cross-lingual phoneme recognition between Vietnamese (tonal language) and English (stress-based language) where non-standard pronunciations hinder phoneme alignment.

Method: Two main contributions: (1) constructing a representative bilingual phoneme set bridging Vietnamese and English phonetic systems, (2) designing an end-to-end system leveraging PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for deep high-level representations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate improved recognition accuracy in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese.

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for addressing complexities of tonal and stress-based phoneme recognition in cross-lingual scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-lingual phoneme recognition has emerged as a significant challenge for
accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) when mixing Vietnamese and English
pronunciations. Unlike many languages, Vietnamese relies on tonal variations to
distinguish word meanings, whereas English features stress patterns and
non-standard pronunciations that hinder phoneme alignment between the two
languages. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bilingual speech
recognition approach with two primary contributions: (1) constructing a
representative bilingual phoneme set that bridges the differences between
Vietnamese and English phonetic systems; (2) designing an end-to-end system
that leverages the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for deep high-level
representations to improve phoneme recognition. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves recognition accuracy
in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese but also provides a robust
framework for addressing the complexities of tonal and stress-based phoneme
recognition

### [3] [Rethinking Reasoning in LLMs: Neuro-Symbolic Local RetoMaton Beyond ICL and CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19271)
*Rushitha Santhoshi Mamidala,Anshuman Chhabra,Ankur Mali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper extends RetoMaton by replacing its global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) constructed from domain corpora, providing more robust and verifiable retrieval compared to prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based reasoning strategies (CoT, ICL) are fragile and yield inconsistent outputs, making them unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. There's a need for more structured and trustworthy alternatives.

Method: Extends RetoMaton framework by using local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automata (WFAs) constructed from external domain corpora instead of global datastores, preserving symbolic traceability with low inference overhead.

Result: Evaluation on LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT across TriviaQA, GSM8K, and MMLU tasks shows consistent performance improvements over base models and prompting methods, with transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics.

Conclusion: Local RetoMaton represents a promising shift toward trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in LLMs through lightweight, automaton-guided memory that provides verifiable and modular retrieval behavior suitable for domain transfer.

Abstract: Prompt-based reasoning strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
In-Context Learning (ICL) have become widely used for eliciting reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, these methods rely on
fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds,
formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for
tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based
neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and
trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with
deterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its
global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA),
constructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton
structure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic
traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles
context and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit
structure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making
it better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this
local RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT
across three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K
(multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge). Compared to the base model and
prompting-based methods, augmenting these setups with local RetoMaton
consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible
retrieval dynamics. Our results highlight a promising shift toward trustworthy,
symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs via lightweight, automaton-guided memory.

### [4] [RAGAPHENE: A RAG Annotation Platform with Human Enhancements and Edits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19272)
*Kshitij Fadnis,Sara Rosenthal,Maeda Hanafi,Yannis Katsis,Marina Danilevsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGAPHENE is a chat-based annotation platform for creating multi-turn RAG conversation benchmarks to evaluate LLMs' factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can provide factually incorrect or hallucinated information in conversations, making it crucial to develop benchmarks that evaluate their performance in retrieval-augmented generation scenarios.

Method: Developed RAGAPHENE, a chat-based annotation platform that enables human annotators to simulate real-world multi-turn conversations for benchmarking LLM performance in RAG settings.

Result: Successfully used by approximately 40 annotators to build thousands of real-world conversation benchmarks for evaluating LLMs.

Conclusion: RAGAPHENE provides an effective platform for creating high-quality evaluation benchmarks that simulate real-world RAG conversations, addressing the need for reliable LLM assessment in factual dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an important aspect of conversing
with Large Language Models (LLMs) when factually correct information is
important. LLMs may provide answers that appear correct, but could contain
hallucinated information. Thus, building benchmarks that can evaluate LLMs on
multi-turn RAG conversations has become an increasingly important task.
Simulating real-world conversations is vital for producing high quality
evaluation benchmarks. We present RAGAPHENE, a chat-based annotation platform
that enables annotators to simulate real-world conversations for benchmarking
and evaluating LLMs. RAGAPHENE has been successfully used by approximately 40
annotators to build thousands of real-world conversations.

### [5] [Leveraging Language Models and Machine Learning in Verbal Autopsy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19274)
*Yue Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This thesis shows that using verbal autopsy narratives with pretrained language models outperforms existing question-only methods for cause of death classification, and multimodal approaches combining narratives and questions work best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In countries without civil registration systems, verbal autopsy is crucial for estimating causes of death, but existing automated methods ignore valuable narrative information from interviews.

Method: Used pretrained language models and machine learning techniques on South African data, fine-tuning transformers on narratives alone and exploring multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and structured questions.

Result: Transformer models using narratives alone outperformed question-only algorithms, especially for non-communicable diseases. Multimodal approaches further improved performance, showing each modality provides unique information. Classification accuracy was affected by information sufficiency levels.

Conclusion: Narratives significantly enhance cause of death classification in verbal autopsies. The findings support rethinking VA instruments and highlight the need for more diverse, high-quality data for training models.

Abstract: In countries without civil registration and vital statistics, verbal autopsy
(VA) is a critical tool for estimating cause of death (COD) and inform policy
priorities. In VA, interviewers ask proximal informants for details on the
circumstances preceding a death, in the form of unstructured narratives and
structured questions. Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms
only use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this
thesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD
classification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning
(ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that
with the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning
outperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and
population levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We
explore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions
in unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD
classification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may
capture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also
characterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe
variations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that
classification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and
models. Overall, this thesis advances the growing body of knowledge at the
intersection of natural language processing, epidemiology, and global health.
It demonstrates the value of narrative in enhancing COD classification. Our
findings underscore the need for more high-quality data from more diverse
settings to use in training and fine-tuning PLM/ML methods, and offer valuable
insights to guide the rethinking and redesign of the VA instrument and
interview.

### [6] [FLAIRR-TS -- Forecasting LLM-Agents with Iterative Refinement and Retrieval for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19279)
*Gunjan Jalori,Preetika Verma,Sercan Ö Arık*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLAIRR-TS is an agentic framework that uses two agents (Forecaster and Refiner) to dynamically optimize prompts for time series forecasting with frozen LLMs, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting with LLMs requires extensive pre-processing, fine-tuning, or manual prompt engineering for each task, which is time-consuming and ad-hoc. There's a need for an automated approach that can generate high-quality forecasts without these burdens.

Method: Uses a two-agent system: a Forecaster agent generates initial forecasts using a prompt, then a Refiner agent iteratively refines the prompt based on past outputs and retrieved similar time series patterns. Employs creative prompt templates and retrieval augmentation without intermediate code generation.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy over static prompting and retrieval-augmented baselines, approaching the performance of specialized manually-crafted prompts. Provides strong forecasting performance across different domains.

Conclusion: FLAIRR-TS offers a practical alternative to tuning and manual prompt engineering, achieving competitive forecasting performance through its adaptive agentic approach to prompt refinement and pattern retrieval.

Abstract: Time series Forecasting with large languagemodels (LLMs) requires bridging
numericalpatterns and natural language. Effective fore-casting on LLM often
relies on extensive pre-processing and fine-tuning.Recent studiesshow that a
frozen LLM can rival specializedforecasters when supplied with a carefully
en-gineered natural-language prompt, but craft-ing such a prompt for each task
is itself oner-ous and ad-hoc. We introduce FLAIRR-TS, atest-time prompt
optimization framework thatutilizes an agentic system: a
Forecaster-agentgenerates forecasts using an initial prompt,which is then
refined by a refiner agent, in-formed by past outputs and retrieved
analogs.This adaptive prompting generalizes across do-mains using creative
prompt templates andgenerates high-quality forecasts without inter-mediate code
generation.Experiments onbenchmark datasets show improved accuracyover static
prompting and retrieval-augmentedbaselines, approaching the performance
ofspecialized prompts.FLAIRR-TS providesa practical alternative to tuning,
achievingstrong performance via its agentic approach toadaptive prompt
refinement and retrieval.

### [7] [CORE: Lossless Compression for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19282)
*Ziqiang Cui,Yunpeng Weng,Xing Tang,Peiyang Liu,Shiwei Li,Bowei He,Jiamin Chen,Xiuqiang He,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE is a reinforcement learning-based method for lossless context compression in RAG systems that achieves 3% compression ratio while improving answer accuracy by 3.3 EM points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG document compression methods increase computational costs and compromise end-task performance due to excessive retrieved documents and lack of well-defined compression targets.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with end-task performance as reward signal and Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train the compressor without predefined compression labels.

Result: Achieves 3% compression ratio while improving average Exact Match score by 3.3 points across four datasets, avoiding performance degradation compared to using full documents.

Conclusion: CORE provides an effective end-to-end training framework for lossless context compression in RAG systems, demonstrating superior performance over previous compression methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
enhance the timeliness of knowledge and the factual accuracy of responses in
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved
documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher
computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved
documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods
often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression
targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot
guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To
address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve
lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to
optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression
labels. Specifically, it utilizes end-task performance as a reward signal and
applies Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train
the compressor. This end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to
generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids
performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all
datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points.
The code will be released soon.

### [8] [Context-Adaptive Synthesis and Compression for Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Complex Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19357)
*Peiran Zhou,Junnan Zhu,Yichen Shen,Ruoxi Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASC framework improves RAG by intelligently processing retrieved documents through analysis, synthesis and compression to handle complex multi-document scenarios with conflicts and redundancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with information overload and inefficient synthesis when dealing with multiple, lengthy, or conflicting documents in complex domains, leading to inaccurate answers.

Method: Proposes CASC framework with Context Analyzer & Synthesizer module that performs key information extraction, cross-document consistency checking, conflict resolution, and question-oriented structured synthesis using a fine-tuned smaller LLM.

Result: CASC consistently outperforms strong baselines on SciDocs-QA dataset, transforming raw scattered information into condensed, structured context that reduces token count and cognitive load.

Conclusion: CASC effectively addresses limitations of traditional RAG in complex multi-document scenarios by providing intelligent context processing and synthesis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language tasks but are prone to
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mitigates these by grounding LLMs in external knowledge. However, in complex
domains involving multiple, lengthy, or conflicting documents, traditional RAG
suffers from information overload and inefficient synthesis, leading to
inaccurate and untrustworthy answers. To address this, we propose CASC
(Context-Adaptive Synthesis and Compression), a novel framework that
intelligently processes retrieved contexts. CASC introduces a Context Analyzer
& Synthesizer (CAS) module, powered by a fine-tuned smaller LLM, which performs
key information extraction, cross-document consistency checking and conflict
resolution, and question-oriented structured synthesis. This process transforms
raw, scattered information into a highly condensed, structured, and
semantically rich context, significantly reducing the token count and cognitive
load for the final Reader LLM. We evaluate CASC on SciDocs-QA, a new
challenging multi-document question answering dataset designed for complex
scientific domains with inherent redundancies and conflicts. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that CASC consistently outperforms strong baselines.

### [9] [Reflective Agreement: Combining Self-Mixture of Agents with a Sequence Tagger for Robust Event Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19359)
*Fatemeh Haji,Mazal Bethany,Cho-Yu Jason Chiang,Anthony Rios,Peyman Najafirad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARIS is a hybrid event extraction system that combines discriminative sequence tagging with generative LLMs, using model consensus and reflective inference to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discriminative models have high precision but low recall, while generative LLMs have better recall but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistency. A hybrid approach is needed to leverage the strengths of both.

Method: ARIS combines Self Mixture of Agents with discriminative sequence tagging, using structured model consensus, confidence-based filtering, and LLM reflective inference to resolve ambiguities. Also uses decomposed instruction fine-tuning for better LLM understanding.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art event extraction methods across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid ARIS approach successfully addresses limitations of both discriminative and generative methods, providing more reliable and accurate event extraction through consensus-based inference and reflective processing.

Abstract: Event Extraction (EE) involves automatically identifying and extracting
structured information about events from unstructured text, including triggers,
event types, and arguments. Traditional discriminative models demonstrate high
precision but often exhibit limited recall, particularly for nuanced or
infrequent events. Conversely, generative approaches leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) provide higher semantic flexibility and recall but suffer from
hallucinations and inconsistent predictions. To address these challenges, we
propose Agreement-based Reflective Inference System (ARIS), a hybrid approach
combining a Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger. ARIS
explicitly leverages structured model consensus, confidence-based filtering,
and an LLM reflective inference module to reliably resolve ambiguities and
enhance overall event prediction quality. We further investigate decomposed
instruction fine-tuning for enhanced LLM event extraction understanding.
Experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
event extraction methods across three benchmark datasets.

### [10] [LongReasonArena: A Long Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19363)
*Jiayu Ding,Shuming Ma,Lei Cui,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongReasonArena is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs' long reasoning capabilities (up to 1M tokens) through multi-step algorithmic tasks, revealing significant performance challenges and a linear accuracy decline with reasoning complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-context benchmarks focus on input comprehension but overlook long reasoning abilities, creating a gap in evaluating how well LLMs can perform extended multi-step reasoning.

Method: The benchmark uses controlled input tasks requiring multi-step algorithms (retrieval, backtracking) that can scale reasoning length arbitrarily up to 1 million tokens.

Result: Deepseek-R1 achieved only 7.5% accuracy on the most challenging tasks, with accuracy showing linear decline relative to the logarithm of required reasoning steps.

Conclusion: LongReasonArena presents a significant challenge for current LLMs and reveals fundamental limitations in long reasoning capabilities, with performance degrading systematically as reasoning complexity increases.

Abstract: Existing long-context benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on
evaluating comprehension of long inputs, while overlooking the evaluation of
long reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce LongReasonArena, a
benchmark specifically designed to assess the long reasoning capabilities of
LLMs. Our tasks require models to solve problems by executing multi-step
algorithms that reflect key aspects of long reasoning, such as retrieval and
backtracking. By controlling the inputs, the required reasoning length can be
arbitrarily scaled, reaching up to 1 million tokens of reasoning for the most
challenging tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that
LongReasonArena presents a significant challenge for both open-source and
proprietary LLMs. For instance, Deepseek-R1 achieves only 7.5% accuracy on our
task. Further analysis also reveals that the accuracy exhibits a linear decline
with respect to the logarithm of the expected number of reasoning steps. Our
code and data is available at

*Zikun Fu,Chen Yang,Kourosh Davoudi,Ken Q. Pu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel approach for Database Entity Recognition in Natural Language Queries using T5-based model with data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning, achieving improved precision and recall over state-of-the-art NER models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of Database Entity Recognition (DB-ER) in Natural Language Queries to improve text-to-SQL systems by accurately identifying database entities.

Method: Created human-annotated benchmark from text-to-SQL datasets, developed data augmentation using SQL queries for automatic NLQ annotation, and built T5-based model with sequence tagging and token classification tasks for fine-tuning and DB-ER.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art NER taggers in both precision and recall. Data augmentation boosted performance by over 10%, and T5 fine-tuning improved metrics by 5-10%.

Conclusion: The proposed DB-ER approach with specialized data augmentation and T5-based modeling significantly improves entity recognition performance for database queries, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging SQL knowledge for NLQ annotation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Database Entity Recognition (DB-ER) in
Natural Language Queries (NLQ). We present several key contributions to advance
this field: (1) a human-annotated benchmark for DB-ER task, derived from
popular text-to-sql benchmarks, (2) a novel data augmentation procedure that
leverages automatic annotation of NLQs based on the corresponding SQL queries
which are available in popular text-to-SQL benchmarks, (3) a specialized
language model based entity recognition model using T5 as a backbone and two
down-stream DB-ER tasks: sequence tagging and token classification for
fine-tuning of backend and performing DB-ER respectively. We compared our DB-ER
tagger with two state-of-the-art NER taggers, and observed better performance
in both precision and recall for our model. The ablation evaluation shows that
data augmentation boosts precision and recall by over 10%, while fine-tuning of
the T5 backbone boosts these metrics by 5-10%.

### [12] [One Joke to Rule them All? On the (Im)possibility of Generalizing Humor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19402)
*Mor Turgeman,Chen Shani,Dafna Shahaf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether humor competence transfers across different humor types in LLMs, finding that training on diverse humor datasets enables up to 75% accuracy on unseen humor tasks with minimal performance drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humor is complex and fragmented in computational research, with new humor types constantly emerging online. The study aims to determine if LLMs can generalize across humor types by capturing transferable mechanisms rather than being limited to specific humor categories.

Method: Conducted transfer learning experiments across four humor datasets representing different humor tasks. Trained LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3 datasets in training) and tested on novel humor tasks to measure transfer capability.

Result: Models achieved up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets. Training on diverse humor sources improved transferability by 1.88-4.05% with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Dad Jokes emerged as the best enabler of transfer but were difficult to transfer to.

Conclusion: LLMs can transfer humor competence across types, suggesting that fragmentation in computational humor research may not be inevitable. Diverse training improves generalization, enabling models to handle emerging humor types in online contexts.

Abstract: Humor is a broad and complex form of communication that remains challenging
for machines. Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational
humor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work,
we wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks
confers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this
fragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types
continuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes,
anti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this
evolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by
capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a
series of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing
different humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3
datasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models
are capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen
datasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%)
with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Further analysis suggests
relations between humor types, with Dad Jokes surprisingly emerging as the best
enabler of transfer (but is difficult to transfer to). We release data and
code.

*Evandro L. T. P. Cunha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper discusses potential loss of human writing ability due to AI text generation tools, drawing parallels to historical writing loss during Greek Dark Ages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the possibility that increased use of AI text generation systems may lead to diminished human writing capabilities, similar to historical periods where writing skills were lost.

Method: Comparative historical analysis, drawing parallels between current AI text generation trends and the loss of writing ability during the Greek Dark Ages (approx. 1200 BCE - 800 BCE).

Result: Identifies a concerning parallel where outsourcing writing to AI systems could potentially lead to significant decline or complete loss of human writing abilities, mirroring historical patterns of literacy loss.

Conclusion: The development and widespread adoption of generative AI text tools poses a risk to human writing capabilities, potentially leading to a future where humans lose this fundamental skill, similar to historical precedents.

Abstract: The 2020s have been witnessing a very significant advance in the development
of generative artificial intelligence tools, including text generation systems
based on large language models. These tools have been increasingly used to
generate texts in the most diverse domains -- from technical texts to literary
texts --, which might eventually lead to a lower volume of written text
production by humans. This article discusses the possibility of a future in
which human beings will have lost or significantly decreased their ability to
write due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines. This possibility
parallels the loss of the ability to write in other moments of human history,
such as during the so-called Greek Dark Ages (approx. 1200 BCE - 800 BCE).

### [14] [Heterogeneous LLM Methods for Ontology Learning (Few-Shot Prompting, Ensemble Typing, and Attention-Based Taxonomies)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19428)
*Aleksandra Beliaeva,Temurbek Rahmatullaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A comprehensive system for LLMs4OL 2025 challenge that addresses ontology construction tasks using retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling, achieving top results across all three tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop scalable and adaptable LLM-based solutions for the full ontology construction pipeline (term extraction, typing, and taxonomy discovery) across heterogeneous domains without requiring model finetuning.

Method: Task A: Joint term extraction and typing using RAG pipeline with lexical augmentation. Task B: Dual strategy - few-shot RAG for domains with labeled data, zero-shot classifier with confidence-weighted embeddings for unseen domains. Task C: Graph inference using cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations from type label embeddings.

Result: Achieved top-ranking results in the official LLMs4OL 2025 challenge leaderboard across all three tasks, demonstrating the system's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The modular, task-specific solutions showcase the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of LLM-based architectures for ontology learning across diverse domains, providing a comprehensive approach to ontology construction.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive system for addressing Tasks A, B, and C of the
LLMs4OL 2025 challenge, which together span the full ontology construction
pipeline: term extraction, typing, and taxonomy discovery. Our approach
combines retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and
attention-based graph modeling -- each tailored to the demands of the
respective task. For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their
ontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.
Training data was reformulated into a document to terms and types
correspondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar
training examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and
improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which
involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the
few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG
scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen
domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores
from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we
model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels,
we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by
approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions
enabled us to achieve top-ranking results in the official leaderboard across
all three tasks. Taken together these strategies showcase the scalability,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoLAP method uses contrastive learning and prompting to transfer knowledge from high-resource to low-resource languages, achieving better performance with limited data than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the language resource disparity in multilingual NLP where high-resource languages have abundant data while low-resource languages lack sufficient training data.

Method: Contrastive Language Alignment with Prompting (CoLAP) integrates contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations to facilitate task-specific knowledge transfer.

Result: CoLAP outperforms few-shot cross-lingual transfer baselines and in-context learning, effectively narrowing the cross-lingual performance gap even with limited data.

Conclusion: The approach enables more efficient multilingual NLP by reducing the need for large labeled datasets and facilitating rapid adaptation to new languages.

Abstract: The disparity in language resources poses a challenge in multilingual NLP,
with high-resource languages benefiting from extensive data, while low-resource
languages lack sufficient data for effective training. Our Contrastive Language
Alignment with Prompting (CoLAP) method addresses this gap by integrating
contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations, facilitating
task-specific knowledge transfer from high-resource to lower-resource
languages. The primary advantage of our approach is its data efficiency,
enabling rapid adaptation to new languages and reducing the need for large
labeled datasets. We conduct experiments with multilingual encoder-only and
decoder-only language models on natural language understanding tasks, including
natural language inference and relation extraction, evaluating performance
across both high- and low-resource languages. Our results demonstrate that
CoLAP outperforms few-shot cross-lingual transfer baselines and in-context
learning, even with limited available data. This effectively narrows the
cross-lingual performance gap, contributing to the development of more
efficient multilingual NLP techniques.

*Sumon Kanti Dey,Jeanne M. Powell,Azra Ismail,Jeanmarie Perrone,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed a named entity recognition framework to extract clinical and social impacts of opioid use from Reddit posts, creating the RedditImpacts 2.0 dataset. Fine-tuned DeBERTa-large outperformed LLMs but still underperformed compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonmedical opioid use has significant public health impacts that are often underreported in traditional healthcare settings. Social media provides candid first-person experiences that can offer valuable insights into these consequences.

Method: Developed a NER framework to extract ClinicalImpacts and SocialImpacts from social media narratives. Created RedditImpacts 2.0 dataset with refined annotation guidelines. Evaluated fine-tuned encoder models (DeBERTa-large) and LLMs under zero- and few-shot learning settings.

Result: Fine-tuned DeBERTa-large achieved relaxed token-level F1 of 0.61, outperforming LLMs in precision, span accuracy, and guideline adherence. Strong NER performance was achievable with less labeled data. However, the best model significantly underperformed compared to inter-expert agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.81).

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning is valuable for clinical NLP tasks, and robust models can be deployed in resource-limited settings. However, a significant gap persists between expert intelligence and current AI capabilities for tasks requiring deep domain knowledge.

Abstract: Nonmedical opioid use is an urgent public health challenge, with far-reaching
clinical and social consequences that are often underreported in traditional
healthcare settings. Social media platforms, where individuals candidly share
first-person experiences, offer a valuable yet underutilized source of insight
into these impacts. In this study, we present a named entity recognition (NER)
framework to extract two categories of self-reported consequences from social
media narratives related to opioid use: ClinicalImpacts (e.g., withdrawal,
depression) and SocialImpacts (e.g., job loss). To support this task, we
introduce RedditImpacts 2.0, a high-quality dataset with refined annotation
guidelines and a focus on first-person disclosures, addressing key limitations
of prior work. We evaluate both fine-tuned encoder-based models and
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) under zero- and few-shot
in-context learning settings. Our fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model achieves a
relaxed token-level F1 of 0.61 [95% CI: 0.43-0.62], consistently outperforming
LLMs in precision, span accuracy, and adherence to task-specific guidelines.
Furthermore, we show that strong NER performance can be achieved with
substantially less labeled data, emphasizing the feasibility of deploying
robust models in resource-limited settings. Our findings underscore the value
of domain-specific fine-tuning for clinical NLP tasks and contribute to the
responsible development of AI tools that may enhance addiction surveillance,
improve interpretability, and support real-world healthcare decision-making.
The best performing model, however, still significantly underperforms compared
to inter-expert agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.81), demonstrating that a gap
persists between expert intelligence and current state-of-the-art NER/AI
capabilities for tasks requiring deep domain knowledge.

TL;DR: Fine-tuned Llama 2-7B model with RACE dataset for automatic question generation to streamline educational assessments


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the challenging process of manual question creation for student evaluations by automating diverse question generation

Method: Used fine-tuned generative LLM (Meta-Llama 2-7B) with RACE dataset, prompt engineering for question style customization, and unsupervised NLP learning methods

Result: Developed a customized model capable of generating various question types (MCQ, conceptual, factual) tailored to instructor preferences

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient tool for educators to automate text-based evaluations, saving time and resources while maintaining fairness in assessments

Abstract: \Abstract{In the realm of education, student evaluation holds equal
significance as imparting knowledge. To be evaluated, students usually need to
go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make
diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their
adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as
they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our
objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic
Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For
tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or
factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this
research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP,
primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base
Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the
fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient
solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based
evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers
can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation
processes.}

*Manuel Mosquera,Melissa Robles,Johan Rodriguez,Ruben Manrique*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-augmented LLMs with reinforcement learning achieve +3.37 BLEU improvement for low-resource Spanish-Wayuunaiki translation by integrating external dictionaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource machine translation remains challenging for LLMs due to limited pretraining exposure and parallel data for fine-tuning, especially for languages like Wayuunaiki.

Method: Combines supervised instruction tuning with Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), allowing models to selectively consult bilingual dictionaries during generation. Uses BLEU scores as rewards to learn when and how to use the tool effectively.

Result: Achieves up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work and 18% relative gain compared to supervised baseline without dictionary access on Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with external tools and reinforcement learning shows promise for improving translation quality in low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), which often lack exposure to these languages during
pretraining and have limited parallel data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel
approach that enhances translation for low-resource languages by integrating an
external dictionary tool and training models end-to-end using reinforcement
learning, in addition to supervised fine-tuning. Focusing on the
Spanish-Wayuunaiki language pair, we frame translation as a tool-augmented
decision-making problem in which the model can selectively consult a bilingual
dictionary during generation. Our method combines supervised instruction tuning
with Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling the model to learn both
when and how to use the tool effectively. BLEU similarity scores are used as
rewards to guide this learning process. Preliminary results show that our
tool-augmented models achieve up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work,
and a 18% relative gain compared to a supervised baseline without dictionary
access, on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set from the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared
Task. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the effects of model
architecture and training strategy, comparing Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct with other
models such as LLaMA and a prior NLLB-based system. These findings highlight
the promise of combining LLMs with external tools and the role of reinforcement
learning in improving translation quality in low-resource language settings.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with detecting card synergies in Slay the Spire, particularly negative interactions, despite strong performance in other reasoning domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well large language models understand and reason about complex rule interactions in dynamic environments like card games.

Method: Introduced a dataset of card synergies from Slay the Spire, classifying card pairs based on positive, negative, or neutral interactions, and evaluated LLM performance on this task.

Result: LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs but struggle with detecting positive and particularly negative synergies, with common errors related to timing, game state definition, and rule following.

Conclusion: The findings suggest directions for future research to improve model performance in predicting rule effects and their interactions in complex environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
variety of domains, including logical reasoning, mathematics, and more. In this
paper, we investigate how well LLMs understand and reason about complex rule
interactions in dynamic environments, such as card games. We introduce a
dataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards
are classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our
evaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs,
they struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We
categorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game
states, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future
research to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and
their interactions.

### [20] [Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19529)
*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Blockwise SFT improves discrete diffusion language models by aligning training with blockwise inference, partitioning responses into fixed blocks and computing loss only on active blocks to eliminate training-inference mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning misaligns with semi-autoregressive inference in diffusion language models, causing noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes that bias gradients away from desired blockwise likelihood.

Method: Partition responses into fixed-size blocks, select one active block per step for stochastic masking, freeze preceding tokens, hide future ones, and compute loss only over the active block to mirror blockwise decoding.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets, with improvements confirmed to stem from training-inference alignment rather than masking effects.

Conclusion: Matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure is crucial for diffusion-based language models, and Blockwise SFT effectively addresses the training-inference mismatch in discrete diffusion models.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text
generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their
semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire
response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This
mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away
from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which
partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step
for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future
ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the
blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show
consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block
size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from
faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects.
Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the
decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM code generation performance is challenging due to limited verifiable training data with accurate test cases, and existing DPO methods have limitations in test case generation.

Method: Proposes splitting code snippets into smaller granular blocks to create diverse DPO pairs from the same test cases, combined with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) splitting and curriculum training for enhanced DPO training.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements in code generation tasks across multiple benchmark datasets including HumanEval, MBPP, APPS, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances DPO training for code generation by leveraging granular code splitting and AST-based methods, leading to substantial performance gains on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
advanced applications like tool invocation and problem-solving. However,
improving performance in code-related tasks remains challenging due to limited
training data that is verifiable with accurate test cases. While Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise, existing methods for
generating test cases still face limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that splits code snippets into smaller, granular blocks, creating more
diverse DPO pairs from the same test cases. Additionally, we introduce the
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) splitting and curriculum training method to enhance
the DPO training. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in code
generation tasks, as validated by experiments on benchmark datasets such as

TL;DR: ProEmoTrans is a prototype-based emotion transfer framework for unseen emotion recognition in conversations, addressing challenges with LLM-enhanced descriptions, parameter-free encoding, and improved attention Viterbi decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ERC research follows closed-domain assumptions, but real-world applications require recognizing unseen emotions due to the lack of consensus in emotion classification in psychology.

Method: Prototype-based emotion transfer framework with three key components: LLM-enhanced description for implicit expressions, parameter-free mechanism for utterance encoding in long conversations, and improved Attention Viterbi Decoding for emotion transition transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ProEmoTrans serves as a strong baseline for the new UERC task.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in unseen emotion recognition and provides a solid foundation for preliminary exploration in this emerging research area.

Abstract: Current Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) research follows a
closed-domain assumption. However, there is no clear consensus on emotion
classification in psychology, which presents a challenge for models when it
comes to recognizing previously unseen emotions in real-world applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce the Unseen Emotion Recognition in Conversation
(UERC) task for the first time and propose ProEmoTrans, a solid prototype-based
emotion transfer framework. This prototype-based approach shows promise but
still faces key challenges: First, implicit expressions complicate emotion
definition, which we address by proposing an LLM-enhanced description approach.
Second, utterance encoding in long conversations is difficult, which we tackle
with a proposed parameter-free mechanism for efficient encoding and overfitting
prevention. Finally, the Markovian flow nature of emotions is hard to transfer,
which we address with an improved Attention Viterbi Decoding (AVD) method to
transfer seen emotion transitions to unseen emotions. Extensive experiments on
three datasets show that our method serves as a strong baseline for preliminary
exploration in this new area.

*Jio Choi,Mohit Bansal,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can identify ambiguities in instructions and exploit loopholes to pursue conflicting goals, presenting AI safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how LLMs handle ambiguity and pragmatics, and to study a novel alignment problem where models face conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities for their advantage.

Method: Designed scenarios with ambiguous user instructions conflicting with given goals, covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. Measured different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their goals versus user goals.

Result: Both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit resulting loopholes, with models that exploit loopholes explicitly reasoning about both ambiguity and conflicting goals.

Conclusion: LLMs' ability to exploit loopholes presents a potential AI safety risk, as they can identify and reason about ambiguities to pursue conflicting objectives rather than user intentions.

Abstract: Studying the responses of large language models (LLMs) to loopholes presents
a two-fold opportunity. First, it affords us a lens through which to examine
ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires
identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second,
loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is
presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own
advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given
a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with
scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power
dynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to
satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that
both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and
exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our
analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and
reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals.

TL;DR: HAMLET is an automated framework for evaluating LLM long-context comprehension using a three-level key-fact hierarchy and query-focused summarization, achieving 90% human agreement while being 25x cheaper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for holistic and automated evaluation of large language models' long-context comprehension capabilities, particularly their ability to recall and faithfully represent information at different granularity levels.

Method: Structures source texts into root-, branch-, and leaf-level key-fact hierarchy, employs query-focused summarization to evaluate information recall and representation at each level, and validates with systematic human studies.

Result: Achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments while reducing cost by 25x. Reveals LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension (especially leaf level), are sensitive to positional effects, find analytical queries more challenging than narrative ones, and show performance gaps between open-source/proprietary models and across scales.

Conclusion: HAMLET provides a reliable, cost-effective automated framework for evaluating long-context comprehension in LLMs, uncovering significant challenges in fine-grained information processing and revealing systematic performance differences across model types and scales.

Abstract: We introduce HAMLET, a holistic and automated framework for evaluating the
long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). HAMLET structures
source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and
leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well
models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate
the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human
study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with
expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET
reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the
leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the
lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative
ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and
proprietary models, as well as across model scales. Our code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in the ArgKP21 dataset for argument key point extraction and introduces ArgCMV, a new dataset with 12K arguments from real online debates across 3K topics, showing higher complexity and better representation of human conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing key point extraction approaches are mostly evaluated on ArgKP21, which has major limitations and doesn't represent actual human conversations well, creating a need for more representative benchmarks.

Method: Using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), the authors curated ArgCMV dataset comprising 12K arguments from actual online human debates across 3K topics, featuring longer arguments with co-referencing, subjective discourse units, and diverse topics.

Result: The new ArgCMV dataset exhibits higher complexity than ArgKP21, and existing methods do not adapt well to it. The paper provides extensive benchmark results with existing baselines and latest open-source models.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel key point extraction dataset for long-context online discussions, setting the stage for next-generation LLM-driven summarization research with more realistic conversational data.

Abstract: Key point extraction is an important task in argument summarization which
involves extracting high-level short summaries from arguments. Existing
approaches for KP extraction have been mostly evaluated on the popular ArgKP21
dataset. In this paper, we highlight some of the major limitations of the
ArgKP21 dataset and demonstrate the need for new benchmarks that are more
representative of actual human conversations. Using SoTA large language models
(LLMs), we curate a new argument key point extraction dataset called ArgCMV
comprising of around 12K arguments from actual online human debates spread
across over 3K topics. Our dataset exhibits higher complexity such as longer,
co-referencing arguments, higher presence of subjective discourse units, and a
larger range of topics over ArgKP21. We show that existing methods do not adapt
well to ArgCMV and provide extensive benchmark results by experimenting with
existing baselines and latest open source models. This work introduces a novel
KP extraction dataset for long-context online discussions, setting the stage
for the next generation of LLM-driven summarization research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Arabic ASR systems struggle with isolated letter recognition due to lack of contextual cues. This study introduces a specialized corpus and shows wav2vec 2.0 achieves only 35% accuracy, improved to 65% with a custom neural network but vulnerable to noise. Adversarial training restores robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Isolated Arabic letter recognition is crucial for language learning, speech therapy, and phonetic research, but current ASR systems excel at word/sentence level while struggling with phoneme-level tasks due to missing co-articulatory cues and lexical context.

Method: Created a diverse diacritised corpus of isolated Arabic letters, tested wav2vec 2.0 models, trained lightweight neural networks on wav2vec embeddings, applied adversarial training with small amplitude perturbations to improve robustness.

Result: Wav2vec 2.0 achieved only 35% accuracy on isolated letters. Custom neural network improved performance to 65%, but small noise (epsilon=0.05) reduced accuracy to 32%. Adversarial training limited noisy-speech accuracy drop to 9% while preserving clean-speech performance.

Conclusion: Isolated letter recognition requires specialized approaches beyond standard ASR. Adversarial training effectively improves robustness to noise. The methods can be extended to word- and sentence-level frameworks where precise letter pronunciation remains critical.

Abstract: Modern Arabic ASR systems such as wav2vec 2.0 excel at word- and
sentence-level transcription, yet struggle to classify isolated letters. In
this study, we show that this phoneme-level task, crucial for language
learning, speech therapy, and phonetic research, is challenging because
isolated letters lack co-articulatory cues, provide no lexical context, and
last only a few hundred milliseconds. Recogniser systems must therefore rely
solely on variable acoustic cues, a difficulty heightened by Arabic's emphatic
(pharyngealized) consonants and other sounds with no close analogues in many
languages. This study introduces a diverse, diacritised corpus of isolated
Arabic letters and demonstrates that state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 models
achieve only 35% accuracy on it. Training a lightweight neural network on
wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%. However, adding a small amplitude
perturbation (epsilon = 0.05) cuts accuracy to 32%. To restore robustness, we
apply adversarial training, limiting the noisy-speech drop to 9% while
preserving clean-speech accuracy. We detail the corpus, training pipeline, and
evaluation protocol, and release, on demand, data and code for reproducibility.
Finally, we outline future work extending these methods to word- and
sentence-level frameworks, where precise letter pronunciation remains critical.

TL;DR: Router Lens method identifies context-faithful experts in LLMs, and Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT) selectively optimizes these experts to improve context faithfulness efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often fail to ground their outputs in provided context, leading to irrelevant responses. The paper explores whether certain experts in mixture-of-experts architectures specialize in context utilization for targeted optimization.

Method: Proposed Router Lens to identify context-faithful experts, then introduced CEFT - a lightweight approach that selectively fine-tunes these identified experts to enhance context grounding.

Result: Experiments across various benchmarks and models show CEFT matches or surpasses full fine-tuning performance while being significantly more efficient.

Conclusion: Specialized context-faithful experts can be identified and selectively optimized to improve context faithfulness in LLMs, providing an efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Context faithfulness is essential for reliable reasoning in context-dependent
scenarios. However, large language models often struggle to ground their
outputs in the provided context, resulting in irrelevant responses. Inspired by
the emergent expert specialization observed in mixture-of-experts
architectures, this work investigates whether certain experts exhibit
specialization in context utilization, offering a potential pathway toward
targeted optimization for improved context faithfulness. To explore this, we
propose Router Lens, a method that accurately identifies context-faithful
experts. Our analysis reveals that these experts progressively amplify
attention to relevant contextual information, thereby enhancing context
grounding. Building on this insight, we introduce Context-faithful Expert
Fine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization approach that selectively
fine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experiments across a wide range of
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CEFT matches or surpasses the
performance of full fine-tuning while being significantly more efficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Injecting noise in RAG helps identify LLM layer functions: shallow layers handle local context, intermediate layers integrate external knowledge, deeper layers use internal knowledge. Proposed Layer Fused Decoding combines intermediate layer outputs with final layer to better exploit external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent empirical evidence shows that noise injection in retrieved documents paradoxically improves generation quality in RAG systems, enabling better analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge.

Method: Proposed Layer Fused Decoding (LFD) that combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs. Used internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion to identify optimal intermediate layer with lowest IKS value in latter half of layers.

Result: Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.

Conclusion: Noise injection reveals layer-specific functional demarcation in LLMs, and LFD provides a simple decoding strategy to better exploit external factual knowledge in RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into
large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks
and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence
demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents
paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves
generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in
practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how
LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on
noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within
the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate
layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper
layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this
insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that
directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer
decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify
the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS)
criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half
of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD
helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with
minimal cost.

*Chong Tian,Qirong Ho,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SALF is a symbolic adversarial learning framework that uses natural language-based agent prompts instead of numerical updates to improve fake news detection through iterative adversarial training between generation and detection agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid LLM advancements enable sophisticated fake news generation, making traditional detection methods inadequate against dynamically evolving misinformation.

Method: Symbolic adversarial learning framework with two agents: generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, detection agent uses structured debates to identify flaws. Agents refine through adversarial interactions using natural language representations of weights, loss, and gradients instead of numerical updates.

Result: SALF generates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average. Also improves detection of refined content by up to 7.7%.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in multilingual settings and inspires development of more robust, adaptable fake news detection systems.

Abstract: Rapid LLM advancements heighten fake news risks by enabling the automatic
generation of increasingly sophisticated misinformation. Previous detection
methods, including fine-tuned small models or LLM-based detectors, often
struggle with its dynamically evolving nature. In this work, we propose a novel
framework called the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which
implements an adversarial training paradigm by an agent symbolic learning
optimization process, rather than relying on numerical updates. SALF introduces
a paradigm where the generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, and the
detection agent uses structured debates to identify logical and factual flaws
for detection, and they iteratively refine themselves through such adversarial
interactions. Unlike traditional neural updates, we represent agents using
agent symbolic learning, where learnable weights are defined by agent prompts,
and simulate back-propagation and gradient descent by operating on natural
language representations of weights, loss, and gradients. Experiments on two
multilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness, showing it
generates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection
performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average. SALF
also refines detectors, improving detection of refined content by up to 7.7%.
We hope our work inspires further exploration into more robust, adaptable fake
news detection systems.

*Yilin Wang,Heng Wang,Yuyang Bai,Minnan Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CSKS framework enables continuous control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge without modifying model weights, using small proxy models to shift output distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address knowledge conflicts in LLMs where parametric knowledge contradicts contextual knowledge, overcoming limitations of previous methods that are inefficient for large models or not workable for black-box models.

Method: Tune two small proxy models and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the original LLM distribution without modifying LLM weights.

Result: Achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased and reduced sensitivity to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed.

Conclusion: CSKS provides a lightweight, effective solution for steering LLMs' knowledge sensitivity without weight modification, working with both open-source and black-box models.

Abstract: In Large Language Models (LLMs) generation, there exist knowledge conflicts
and scenarios where parametric knowledge contradicts knowledge provided in the
context. Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and
editing context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual
knowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large
models, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust
LLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these
problems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a
simple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge
continuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e.
proxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the
original distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the
evaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics
to measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real
conflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over
LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity
and reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual
or parametric knowledge as needed flexibly. Our data and code are available at

Motivation: Address the lack of resources for European Portuguese ASR compared to Brazilian Portuguese by creating a comprehensive framework for EP and other Portuguese varieties.

Method: Developed a framework with: (1) 46h EP test benchmark across multiple domains, (2) multiple foundation models evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, (3) E-Branchformer models trained from scratch using 425h curated EP data.

Result: Fine-tuned foundation models and E-Branchformer show comparable performance for EP. Best models achieve >35% relative WER improvement over strongest zero-shot foundation model, setting new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CAMÕES successfully bridges the resource gap for European Portuguese ASR, establishing new benchmarks and state-of-the-art performance through comprehensive evaluation and model development.

Abstract: Existing resources for Automatic Speech Recognition in Portuguese are mostly
focused on Brazilian Portuguese, leaving European Portuguese (EP) and other
varieties under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce CAM\~OES, the first
open framework for EP and other Portuguese varieties. It consists of (1) a
comprehensive evaluation benchmark, including 46h of EP test data spanning
multiple domains; and (2) a collection of state-of-the-art models. For the
latter, we consider multiple foundation models, evaluating their zero-shot and
fine-tuned performances, as well as E-Branchformer models trained from scratch.
A curated set of 425h of EP was used for both fine-tuning and training. Our
results show comparable performance for EP between fine-tuned foundation models
and the E-Branchformer. Furthermore, the best-performing models achieve
relative improvements above 35% WER, compared to the strongest zero-shot
foundation model, establishing a new state-of-the-art for EP and other
varieties.

### [35] [NLKI: A lightweight Natural Language Knowledge Integration Framework for Improving Small VLMs in Commonsense VQA Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19724)
*Aritra Dutta,Swapnanil Mukherjee,Deepanway Ghosal,Somak Aditya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLKI framework enhances small vision-language models by integrating retrieved commonsense facts and LLM-generated explanations, boosting performance by up to 7% across datasets and making 250M models competitive with larger VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small vision-language models lag behind larger counterparts in commonsense VQA due to missing knowledge. The study aims to improve sVLMs through careful commonsense knowledge integration.

Method: End-to-end framework that retrieves natural language facts using fine-tuned ColBERTv2, prompts LLM to generate explanations, and feeds both signals to sVLMs. Additional noise-robust loss finetuning (symmetric cross entropy, generalized cross entropy) is applied.

Result: 7% accuracy improvement across 3 datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA, e-SNLI-VE), making FLAVA and other models match/exceed medium-sized VLMs. Noise-robust training added 2.5% in CRIC and 5.5% in AOKVQA.

Conclusion: LLM-based commonsense knowledge can outperform retrieval from knowledge bases, noise-aware training stabilizes small models with external knowledge, and parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is achievable for 250M models.

Abstract: Commonsense visual-question answering often hinges on knowledge that is
missing from the image or the question. Small vision-language models (sVLMs)
such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative
counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration
on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural
language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and
(iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA
datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts
retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched
prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting
the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA
and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B
and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional
finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and
generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our
findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from
commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models
in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient
commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.

### [36] [Spotlight Attention: Towards Efficient LLM Generation via Non-linear Hashing-based KV Cache Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19740)
*Wenhao Li,Yuxin Zhang,Gen Luo,Haiyuan Wan,Ziyang Gong,Fei Chao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spotlight Attention uses non-linear hashing to optimize KV cache selection in LLMs, achieving 5x shorter hash codes, 3x higher throughput, and efficient GPU training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache reduction methods use inefficient linear hashing due to orthogonal query-key distributions in narrow cones, requiring better optimization.

Method: Non-linear hashing functions to optimize embedding distribution, Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss for lightweight training, and specialized CUDA kernels for bitwise operations.

Result: 5x shorter hash codes, under 100μs retrieval for 512K tokens on A100 GPU, 3x higher end-to-end throughput than vanilla decoding.

Conclusion: Spotlight Attention significantly improves KV cache efficiency with better retrieval precision and computational performance through optimized non-linear hashing.

Abstract: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs)
significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches
during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear
hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to
the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in
LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear
hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys,
enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight,
stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling
optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8
hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves
retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least
5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the
computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA
kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a
single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla
decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NEWSCOPE is a two-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that uses sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to reduce redundancy and improve viewpoint exposure in news search results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most news retrieval systems prioritize textual relevance, leading to redundant results and limited exposure to diverse perspectives, which is essential for comprehensive event understanding.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) dense retrieval for topically relevant content, 2) sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to surface complementary information. Introduces three interpretable diversity metrics.

Result: NEWSCOPE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significantly higher diversity without compromising relevance. Effective in mitigating redundancy and promoting comprehensive event understanding.

Conclusion: Fine-grained, interpretable modeling at the sentence level is effective for diverse news retrieval. The framework successfully balances relevance and diversity while providing interpretable metrics for evaluation.

Abstract: Access to diverse perspectives is essential for understanding real-world
events, yet most news retrieval systems prioritize textual relevance, leading
to redundant results and limited viewpoint exposure. We propose NEWSCOPE, a
two-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that enhances event coverage by
explicitly modeling semantic variation at the sentence level. The first stage
retrieves topically relevant content using dense retrieval, while the second
stage applies sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to
surface complementary information. To evaluate retrieval diversity, we
introduce three interpretable metrics, namely Average Pairwise Distance,
Positive Cluster Coverage, and Information Density Ratio, and construct two
paragraph-level benchmarks: LocalNews and DSGlobal. Experiments show that
NEWSCOPE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significantly
higher diversity without compromising relevance. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of fine-grained, interpretable modeling in mitigating redundancy
and promoting comprehensive event understanding. The data and code are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Expert persona prompting shows mixed effectiveness - usually positive or non-significant performance changes, but models are highly sensitive to irrelevant persona details with up to 30% performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why expert persona prompting should improve task performance, as prior work shows mixed results without clear explanations.

Method: Analyzed literature on persona prompting, distilled three desiderata, and evaluated 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across 27 tasks to assess performance advantage, robustness to irrelevant attributes, and fidelity to persona attributes.

Result: Expert personas usually lead to positive or non-significant changes. Models are highly sensitive to irrelevant details (30% performance drops). Higher education/specialization effects are inconsistent. Mitigation strategies only work for largest models.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for more careful persona design and evaluation schemes that reflect intended effects of persona usage, as current approaches show significant robustness issues.

Abstract: Expert persona prompting -- assigning roles such as expert in math to
language models -- is widely used for task improvement. However, prior work
shows mixed results on its effectiveness, and does not consider when and why
personas should improve performance. We analyze the literature on persona
prompting for task improvement and distill three desiderata: 1) performance
advantage of expert personas, 2) robustness to irrelevant persona attributes,
and 3) fidelity to persona attributes. We then evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs
across 27 tasks with respect to these desiderata. We find that expert personas
usually lead to positive or non-significant performance changes. Surprisingly,
models are highly sensitive to irrelevant persona details, with performance
drops of almost 30 percentage points. In terms of fidelity, we find that while
higher education, specialization, and domain-relatedness can boost performance,
their effects are often inconsistent or negligible across tasks. We propose
mitigation strategies to improve robustness -- but find they only work for the
largest, most capable models. Our findings underscore the need for more careful
persona design and for evaluation schemes that reflect the intended effects of
persona usage.

TL;DR: Proposes table-to-report task and T2R-bench benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to transform complex industrial tables into reports, showing current models still underperform with 62.71 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing table reasoning research doesn't adequately address practical industrial applications where complex, diverse tables need to be transformed into comprehensive reports, and current benchmarks lack practical assessment capabilities.

Method: Created T2R-bench, a bilingual benchmark with 457 real-world industrial tables from 19 domains and 4 table types, with proposed evaluation criteria to measure report generation quality. Tested 25 LLMs including state-of-the-art models.

Result: Even the best-performing model (Deepseek-R1) only achieved 62.71 overall score, demonstrating significant room for improvement in table-to-report capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs still struggle with transforming complex industrial tables into reports, and the proposed T2R-bench provides a practical benchmark to measure and improve this capability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of
transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge
for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1)
the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes;
and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the
practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the
table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where
the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The
benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world
scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial
tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the
quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal
that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance
with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement
on T2R-bench. Source code and data will be available after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Memory-R1 is an RL framework that enables LLMs to actively manage external memory through two specialized agents, outperforming baselines with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are stateless with limited context windows, and existing memory augmentation approaches lack learned mechanisms for dynamic memory management.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework with two agents: Memory Manager (learns structured memory operations) and Answer Agent (selects and reasons over memory entries), fine-tuned with PPO and GRPO.

Result: Outperforms competitive baselines with only 152 training examples, shows strong generalization across question types and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: RL enables more agentic, memory-aware behaviors in LLMs, paving the way for richer persistent reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained
by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts
to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet
most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned
mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present
Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the
ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized
agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations
{ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NOOP}, and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant
entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned
with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and
use with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a
corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the most
competitive existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across
diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective
approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic,
memory-aware behaviors in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent
reasoning systems.

Abstract: Evaluating instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hindi is
challenging due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks, as direct translation of
English datasets fails to capture crucial linguistic and cultural nuances. To
address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets:
IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created
using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a
translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive

TL;DR: A text embedding-based classification framework for qualitative analysis that requires minimal examples per category and achieves high agreement with human coders (Cohen's Kappa 0.74-0.83).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional qualitative coding is time-consuming and inconsistent, while existing NLP solutions require extensive labeled data or disrupt qualitative workflows.

Method: Text embedding-based classification framework that needs only a handful of examples per category and integrates with standard qualitative workflows.

Result: Achieves Cohen's Kappa of 0.74-0.83 compared to expert human coders on 2899 physics survey responses. Performance improves with fine-tuning and can audit existing datasets.

Conclusion: Text embedding-assisted coding enables scalable deductive qualitative analysis without sacrificing interpretability, working with minimal examples per category.

Abstract: Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses is a commonly-used
research method in the social sciences, but traditional coding approaches are
often time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Existing solutions from
Natural Language Processing such as supervised classifiers, topic modeling
techniques, and generative large language models have limited applicability in
qualitative analysis, since they demand extensive labeled data, disrupt
established qualitative workflows, and/or yield variable results. In this
paper, we introduce a text embedding-based classification framework that
requires only a handful of examples per category and fits well with standard
qualitative workflows. When benchmarked against human analysis of a conceptual
physics survey consisting of 2899 open-ended responses, our framework achieves
a Cohen's Kappa ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 as compared to expert human coders in
an exhaustive coding scheme. We further show how performance of this framework
improves with fine-tuning of the text embedding model, and how the method can
be used to audit previously-analyzed datasets. These findings demonstrate that
text embedding-assisted coding can flexibly scale to thousands of responses
without sacrificing interpretability, opening avenues for deductive qualitative
analysis at scale.

TL;DR: TokenVerse++ improves upon TokenVerse by enabling training with partially annotated datasets through learnable vectors for dynamic task activation, achieving comparable or better performance across multiple tasks without sacrificing ASR quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-based multitasking frameworks like TokenVerse require complete labels for all tasks on every training utterance, which limits their ability to leverage partially annotated datasets and scale effectively.

Method: Introduces learnable vectors in the acoustic embedding space of the XLSR-Transducer ASR model for dynamic task activation, allowing training with utterances labeled for only a subset of tasks.

Result: Successfully integrates datasets with partial labels (ASR + language identification), improves overall performance, and achieves results on par with or exceeding TokenVerse across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: TokenVerse++ establishes itself as a more practical multitask alternative that can effectively utilize partially annotated data without compromising ASR performance.

Abstract: Token-based multitasking frameworks like TokenVerse require all training
utterances to have labels for all tasks, hindering their ability to leverage
partially annotated datasets and scale effectively. We propose TokenVerse++,
which introduces learnable vectors in the acoustic embedding space of the
XLSR-Transducer ASR model for dynamic task activation. This core mechanism
enables training with utterances labeled for only a subset of tasks, a key
advantage over TokenVerse. We demonstrate this by successfully integrating a
dataset with partial labels, specifically for ASR and an additional task,
language identification, improving overall performance. TokenVerse++ achieves
results on par with or exceeding TokenVerse across multiple tasks, establishing
it as a more practical multitask alternative without sacrificing ASR
performance.

TL;DR: Human-curated simple language from Simple Wikipedia can effectively guide curriculum learning when introduced first, improving perplexity on simple language, while competence-based strategies show no consistent benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether human-curated simple language can serve as an effective signal for curriculum learning, addressing the challenge of defining and measuring linguistic difficulty in CL approaches.

Method: Using article-level labels from Simple Wikipedia corpus, compared label-based curricula to competence-based strategies with shallow heuristics. Experiments conducted with BERT-tiny model.

Result: Adding simple data alone showed no clear benefit, but structuring it via curriculum (especially when introduced first) consistently improved perplexity, particularly on simple language. Competence-based curricula led to no consistent gains over random ordering.

Conclusion: Human intuition about linguistic difficulty can effectively guide curriculum learning for language model pre-training, with simple-first curricula outperforming competence-based approaches.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) aims to improve training by presenting data from
"easy" to "hard", yet defining and measuring linguistic difficulty remains an
open challenge. We investigate whether human-curated simple language can serve
as an effective signal for CL. Using the article-level labels from the Simple
Wikipedia corpus, we compare label-based curricula to competence-based
strategies relying on shallow heuristics. Our experiments with a BERT-tiny
model show that adding simple data alone yields no clear benefit. However,
structuring it via a curriculum -- especially when introduced first --
consistently improves perplexity, particularly on simple language. In contrast,
competence-based curricula lead to no consistent gains over random ordering,
probably because they fail to effectively separate the two classes. Our results
suggest that human intuition about linguistic difficulty can guide CL for
language model pre-training.

*Chiman Salavati,Shannon Song,Scott A. Hale,Roberto E. Montenegro,Shiri Dori-Hacohen,Fabricio Murai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small language models outperform large language models in detecting inappropriate language in medical instructional materials, with multilabel classifiers and negative example training showing best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical instructional materials often contain outdated, exclusionary, or non-patient-centered language that can negatively impact clinical training and patient outcomes, but manual review is impractical due to volume.

Method: Evaluated fine-tuned small language models (general classifier, binary classifiers, multilabel classifier, hierarchical pipeline) and pre-trained LLMs with in-context learning on 500 documents (12,000+ pages) using various prompt strategies.

Result: SLMs significantly outperformed LLama-3 8B/70B models. Multilabel classifier performed best on annotated data, while supplementing training with negative examples boosted binary classifiers' AUC by up to 25%.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned small language models, particularly those trained with negative examples, are most effective for automated detection and mitigation of harmful language in medical curricula.

Abstract: The use of inappropriate language -- such as outdated, exclusionary, or
non-patient-centered terms -- medical instructional materials can significantly
influence clinical training, patient interactions, and health outcomes. Despite
their reputability, many materials developed over past decades contain examples
now considered inappropriate by current medical standards. Given the volume of
curricular content, manually identifying instances of inappropriate use of
language (IUL) and its subcategories for systematic review is prohibitively
costly and impractical. To address this challenge, we conduct a first-in-class
evaluation of small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on labeled data and
pre-trained LLMs with in-context learning on a dataset containing approximately
500 documents and over 12,000 pages. For SLMs, we consider: (1) a general IUL
classifier, (2) subcategory-specific binary classifiers, (3) a multilabel
classifier, and (4) a two-stage hierarchical pipeline for general IUL detection
followed by multilabel classification. For LLMs, we consider variations of
prompts that include subcategory definitions and/or shots. We found that both
LLama-3 8B and 70B, even with carefully curated shots, are largely outperformed
by SLMs. While the multilabel classifier performs best on annotated data,
supplementing training with unflagged excerpts as negative examples boosts the
specific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, making them most effective models for
mitigating harmful language in medical curricula.

*Mohammed Rakibul Hasan,Rafi Majid,Ahanaf Tahmid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bangla-Bayanno is a new open-ended Visual Question Answering dataset for Bangla language with 52,650 QA pairs across 4,750+ images, created using multilingual LLM-assisted translation to ensure high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive, high-quality VQA datasets for Bangla (a low-resource language) and overcome issues with existing datasets that are either domain-specific, manually annotated with biases, or have poor translation quality.

Method: Implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline to mitigate human-induced errors and ensure translation quality. Questions are classified into three answer types: nominal (descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no).

Result: Created a dataset of 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4,750+ images with high-quality translations, providing the most comprehensive open-source VQA benchmark in Bangla.

Conclusion: Bangla-Bayanno serves as a high-quality benchmark to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate development of more inclusive AI systems for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Bangla-Bayanno, an open-ended Visual Question
Answering (VQA) Dataset in Bangla, a widely used, low-resource language in
multimodal AI research. The majority of existing datasets are either manually
annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or
are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced
errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted
translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of
low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises
52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into
three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative
(numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive
open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research
in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more
inclusive AI systems.

*Ramya Keerthy Thatikonda,Wray Buntine,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive logical reasoning, using Chain-of-Thought data generation and a novel echo generation technique to cover more error types, showing improved performance across multiple datasets and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for LLMs, but test-time scaling with reward models is under-explored in deductive reasoning. The paper aims to enhance LLM performance in complex reasoning tasks through specialized reward models.

Method: Developed Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) trained on data generated using Chain-of-Thought (single and multiple samples) and a novel echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions to extract additional training data covering previously unexplored error types.

Result: ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrated improved performance on FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different large language models.

Conclusion: The proposed ORMs with echo generation technique effectively enhance deductive logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs by covering more error types and improving performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid
conclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling
with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to
enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is
under-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly
generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples.
Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors
covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo
generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect
assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering
previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain
errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers
the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and
echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic,
and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.

*Jingyu Guo,Yingying Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based AI agents spontaneously develop stereotype biases through multi-agent interactions, even without predefined biases, with effects intensifying through hierarchical structures and increased interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions beyond biases inherited from training data, challenging the presumption that AI systems are less susceptible to such biases.

Method: Novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions with neutral initial conditions, using LLM-based multi-agent systems with comprehensive quantitative analysis across different LLM architectures.

Result: AI agents developed stereotype-driven biases despite no initial biases, with effects intensifying through increased interactions and hierarchical structures, showing group effects analogous to human social behavior (halo effects, confirmation bias, role congruity) consistently across different LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Stereotype formation in AI systems may be an emergent property of multi-agent interactions rather than just training data biases, highlighting the need for research on underlying mechanisms and mitigation strategies for ethical impacts.

Abstract: While stereotypes are well-documented in human social interactions, AI
systems are often presumed to be less susceptible to such biases. Previous
studies have focused on biases inherited from training data, but whether
stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions merits further
exploration. Through a novel experimental framework simulating workplace
interactions with neutral initial conditions, we investigate the emergence and
evolution of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our findings reveal
that (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their
interactions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype
effects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power,
particularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems
exhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo
effects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype
patterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures. Through
comprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype
formation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent
interactions, rather than merely from training data biases. Our work
underscores the need for future research to explore the underlying mechanisms
of this phenomenon and develop strategies to mitigate its ethical impacts.

*Yifu Huo,Chenglong Wang,Qiren Zhu,Shunjie Xing,Tong Xiao,Chunliang Zhang,Tongran Liu,Jinbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HEAL framework evaluates preference optimization methods by analyzing ranking consistency and preference strength across multiple potential responses in hypothesis spaces, rather than just single outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for preference optimization like DPO only assess single responses, ignoring other potential outputs that could be generated in real applications, creating an incomplete evaluation picture.

Method: Proposes HEAL framework that treats preference alignment as a re-ranking process within hypothesis spaces, using two metrics: ranking accuracy for ordinal consistency and preference strength correlation for continuous alignment. Also develops UniHypoBench benchmark from diverse instruction-response pairs.

Result: Experiments show current preference learning methods effectively capture proxy model preferences while suppressing negative samples. The framework provides robust diagnostic tools and identifies directions for advanced alignment algorithms.

Conclusion: HEAL introduces hypothesis space analysis as a novel paradigm for understanding preference alignment, offering both theoretical innovation and practical diagnostic tools for refining preference optimization methods.

Abstract: Preference optimization methods like DPO have achieved remarkable performance
in LLM alignment. However, the evaluation for these methods relies on a single
response and overlooks other potential outputs, which could also be generated
in real-world applications within this hypothetical space. To address this
issue, this paper presents a \textbf{H}ypothesis-based
Pr\textbf{E}ference-aware \textbf{A}na\textbf{L}ysis Framework (HEAL), a novel
evaluation paradigm that formulates preference alignment as a re-ranking
process within hypothesis spaces. The framework incorporates two complementary
metrics: ranking accuracy for evaluating ordinal consistency and preference
strength correlation for assessing continuous alignment. To facilitate this
framework, we develop UniHypoBench, a unified hypothesis benchmark constructed
from diverse instruction-response pairs. Through extensive experiments based on
HEAL, with a particular focus on the intrinsic mechanisms of preference
learning, we demonstrate that current preference learning methods can
effectively capture preferences provided by proxy models while simultaneously
suppressing negative samples. These findings contribute to preference learning
research through two significant avenues. Theoretically, we introduce
hypothesis space analysis as an innovative paradigm for understanding
preference alignment. Practically, HEAL offers researchers robust diagnostic
tools for refining preference optimization methods, while our empirical results
identify promising directions for developing more advanced alignment algorithms
capable of comprehensive preference capture.

*Slimane Bellaouar,Attia Nehar,Soumia Souffi,Mounia Bouameur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a new approach for Arabic subjectivity classification using fine-tuned Arabic language models on a newly created comprehensive dataset (AraDhati+), achieving 97.79% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic faces challenges as an under-resourced language with scarce annotated datasets for subjectivity analysis, despite being linguistically rich and morphologically complex.

Method: Developed AraDhati+ dataset by combining existing Arabic datasets (ASTD, LABR, HARD, SANAD), then fine-tuned state-of-the-art Arabic language models (XLM-RoBERTa, AraBERT, ArabianGPT) and experimented with ensemble decision approach.

Result: Achieved remarkable 97.79% accuracy for Arabic subjectivity classification, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing limited resource challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses Arabic language processing challenges by leveraging existing datasets and fine-tuning advanced language models, showing high effectiveness for subjectivity classification.

Abstract: Despite its significance, Arabic, a linguistically rich and morphologically
complex language, faces the challenge of being under-resourced. The scarcity of
large annotated datasets hampers the development of accurate tools for
subjectivity analysis in Arabic. Recent advances in deep learning and
Transformers have proven highly effective for text classification in English
and French. This paper proposes a new approach for subjectivity assessment in
Arabic textual data. To address the dearth of specialized annotated datasets,
we developed a comprehensive dataset, AraDhati+, by leveraging existing Arabic
datasets and collections (ASTD, LABR, HARD, and SANAD). Subsequently, we
fine-tuned state-of-the-art Arabic language models (XLM-RoBERTa, AraBERT, and
ArabianGPT) on AraDhati+ for effective subjectivity classification.
Furthermore, we experimented with an ensemble decision approach to harness the
strengths of individual models. Our approach achieves a remarkable accuracy of
97.79\,\% for Arabic subjectivity classification. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges posed by
limited resources in Arabic language processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prophet is a training-free decoding method that accelerates diffusion language models by leveraging early answer convergence, allowing early commitment to final outputs using confidence-based criteria, achieving up to 3.4x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models suffer from slow inference due to bidirectional attention costs and many refinement steps, despite offering parallel generation and flexible token orders.

Method: Prophet uses early answer convergence property - dynamically decides to continue refinement or decode all remaining tokens in one step based on confidence gap between top-2 prediction candidates, requiring no additional training.

Result: On GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances can be decoded correctly using only half the refinement steps. Prophet reduces decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving generation quality on LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B models.

Conclusion: Early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques, recasting DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to
autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible
token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of
autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and
the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this
work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer
convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by
half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and
random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%
of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the
refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a
training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.
Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to
go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the
confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It
integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible
overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of
LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the
number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation
quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop
sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet
powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing
speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at

*Lisa Alazraki,Lihu Chen,Ana Brassard,Joe Stacey,Hossein A. Rahmani,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with mixed-type compositional reasoning (commonsense + math) showing ~30% accuracy drop compared to solving each step individually, while humans perform equally well on both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, but real-world tasks require combining both. Need to test LLMs' ability to handle mixed-type compositional reasoning.

Method: Created AgentCoMa benchmark with tasks requiring both commonsense and math reasoning steps. Tested 61 LLMs of different sizes/families. Conducted interpretability studies (neuron patterns, attention maps, membership inference).

Result: LLMs show ~30% accuracy drop when combining commonsense and math reasoning vs solving steps individually. Humans perform equally well on both. Performance gap is larger than in same-type compositional benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit substantial brittleness in mixed-type compositional reasoning. AgentCoMa provides a test bed for future model improvements in this critical capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved high accuracy on complex
commonsense and mathematical problems that involve the composition of multiple
reasoning steps. However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills
tend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents
solving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each
compositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning
step. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training
strategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet
their accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a
substantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior
compositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning
type. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional
questions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy.
Furthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better
understand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and
membership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model
brittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a
test bed for future improvement.

TL;DR: MathBuddy is an emotionally-aware LLM math tutor that models student emotions from text and facial expressions to provide empathetic, pedagogically appropriate responses, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based learning systems ignore student affective states, despite educational psychology research showing emotions significantly impact learning capabilities. There's a need to bridge this gap by creating emotionally-aware tutoring systems.

Method: Developed MathBuddy, an LLM-powered math tutor that dynamically models student emotions from conversational text and facial expressions, aggregates emotions from both modalities, and maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies for empathetic responses.

Result: Achieved 23 point performance gain using win rate and 3 point gain using DAMR scores across eight pedagogical dimensions. User studies and automatic evaluation metrics strongly support improved pedagogical abilities through emotion modeling.

Conclusion: Modeling student emotions significantly enhances LLM-based tutors' pedagogical effectiveness, making tutor-student conversations more empathetic and educationally beneficial.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLM-based conversational systems is already
transforming the landscape of educational technology. However, the current
state-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's
affective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim
that positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning
capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware
LLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and
maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student
conversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from
the conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's
emotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM
Tutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our
model using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions
and user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win
rate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly
supports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by
modeling students' emotions.

*Yiming Du,Yifan Xiang,Bin Liang,Dahua Lin,Kam-Fai Wong,Fei Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSURE is an adaptive learning method that dynamically down-weights unreliable supervision in multi-turn dialogue training without explicit filtering, using online statistics to estimate per-turn loss distributions and improve training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning multi-turn dialogue systems suffers from degraded performance when exposed to low-quality data, with supervision errors in early turns propagating across subsequent turns and undermining coherence. Existing static prefiltering methods decouple quality control from training and fail to mitigate turn-level error propagation.

Method: ReSURE estimates per-turn loss distributions using Welford's online statistics and dynamically reweights sample losses on the fly to down-weight unreliable supervision without explicit filtering.

Result: Experiments on single-source and mixed-quality datasets show improved stability and response quality. ReSURE achieves positive Spearman correlations (0.21-1.0 across benchmarks) between response scores and sample count regardless of data quality.

Conclusion: ReSURE effectively addresses supervision error propagation in multi-turn dialogue training and potentially enables more effective utilization of large-scale data by dynamically adapting to supervision reliability during training.

Abstract: Fine-tuning multi-turn dialogue systems requires high-quality supervision but
often suffers from degraded performance when exposed to low-quality data.
Supervision errors in early turns can propagate across subsequent turns,
undermining coherence and response quality. Existing methods typically address
data quality via static prefiltering, which decouples quality control from
training and fails to mitigate turn-level error propagation. In this context,
we propose ReSURE (Regularizing Supervision UnREliability), an adaptive
learning method that dynamically down-weights unreliable supervision without
explicit filtering. ReSURE estimates per-turn loss distributions using
Welford's online statistics and reweights sample losses on the fly accordingly.
Experiments on both single-source and mixed-quality datasets show improved
stability and response quality. Notably, ReSURE enjoys positive Spearman
correlations (0.21 ~ 1.0 across multiple benchmarks) between response scores
and number of samples regardless of data quality, which potentially paves the
way for utilizing large-scale data effectively. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRA method improves legal text classification on rare classes by selectively augmenting low-frequency labels from training data only, achieving better F1 scores than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal text classification datasets often have long-tail distributions where rare classes are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on these classes.

Method: Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) that focuses on augmenting samples from low-frequency labels in the training set only, preventing noise for well-represented classes without changing model architecture.

Result: SRA achieves higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE baselines on both LEDGAR (single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label) datasets.

Conclusion: SRA provides consistent improvements for long-tail legal text classification by selectively augmenting rare classes from training data, eliminating need for external corpora and preventing information leakage.

Abstract: Legal text classification is a fundamental NLP task in the legal domain.
Benchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution,
where many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on
rare classes. This paper proposes Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a
solution to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to
low-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise
for well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model
architecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure
there is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external
corpora simultaneously. The proposed SRA method is tested on two legal text
classification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR
(single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). The results indicate that SRA
attains higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE
baselines across both datasets, illustrating consistent improvements in
long-tail legal text classification. The code repository is available at:

TL;DR: DeepScholar-bench is a live benchmark and automated evaluation framework for generative research synthesis systems, using recent ArXiv papers to test related work section generation with holistic assessment across knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for research synthesis systems are inadequate - short-form QA benchmarks don't capture complexity, and expert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination, failing to represent real research synthesis challenges.

Method: Created DeepScholar-bench with queries from recent high-quality ArXiv papers, focusing on generating related work sections. Developed evaluation framework assessing knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and verifiability. Built DeepScholar-base reference pipeline using LOTUS API.

Result: DeepScholar-base established strong baseline with competitive/higher performance than other methods (prior open-source systems, search AIs, OpenAI's DeepResearch). No system exceeded 19% across all metrics, showing benchmark difficulty.

Conclusion: DeepScholar-bench is challenging and important for advancing AI systems capable of generative research synthesis, with significant room for improvement as current systems perform poorly on comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: The ability to research and synthesize knowledge is central to human
expertise and progress. An emerging class of systems promises these exciting
capabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over
the live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited
summaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing
question-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while
expert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to
capture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In
this work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic,
automated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research
synthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv
papers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related
work sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior
research. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across
three key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and
verifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline
implemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench
framework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems,
search AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that
DeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher
performance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains
far from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\%$ across all
metrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well
as its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative
research synthesis. We make our code available at

*Sheng Liu,Qiang Sheng,Danding Wang,Yang Li,Guang Yang,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IMAGINE is a framework that generates jailbreak-like instructions to fill distribution gaps in safety alignment data, reducing attack success rates on LLMs without compromising utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks due to distributional mismatch between safety training data and real-world malicious instructions, forcing developers into reactive patching cycles.

Method: IMAGINE uses embedding space distribution analysis and iterative optimization to synthesize jailbreak-like instructions that augment safety alignment corpora coverage.

Result: Significant decreases in attack success rates on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 models without compromising their utility.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses distributional gaps in safety alignment data, providing proactive protection against jailbreak attacks rather than reactive patching.

Abstract: Despite advances in improving large language model(LLM) to refuse to answer
malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks
where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety
alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen
malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between
training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive
patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis
framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate
jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional
gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE
follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text
generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of
safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on
the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates
significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2
without compromising their utility.

{MedArabiQ}, covering broader medical domains such as internal medicine,
pediatrics, and clinical decision making. Each track comprises multiple
subtasks, evaluation datasets, and standardized metrics, facilitating fair
benchmarking. The task was structured to promote modeling under realistic,
multilingual, and culturally nuanced healthcare contexts. We outline the
dataset creation, task design and evaluation framework, participation
statistics, baseline systems, and summarize the overall outcomes. We conclude

*Chengzu Li,Wenshan Wu,Huanyu Zhang,Qingtao Li,Zeyu Gao,Yan Xia,José Hernández-Orallo,Ivan Vulić,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current MLLMs show early signs of spatial cognition but have large performance gaps compared to humans, with random instance-level performance versus predictable human performance based on pattern complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial reasoning and perception are closely linked in human cognition but remain underexplored in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite their impressive reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduced 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from standardized spatial aptitude tests with fine-grained expert annotations of perceptual complexity and reasoning process. Evaluated 14 MLLMs and compared with human performance.

Result: MLLMs exhibit early spatial cognition signs with cognitive profiles resembling humans (effort correlates with reasoning complexity), but show large performance gaps and random instance-level performance compared to humans' predictable performance based on abstract pattern complexity.

Conclusion: Findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations in MLLMs' spatial reasoning, providing actionable insights for advancing model design in spatial cognition.

Abstract: For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closely
entangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in the
evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLM
advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for
human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we
introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning
abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to
our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic
standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained
expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process,
enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive
experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs
exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap
compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that
cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity.
However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas
human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern
complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations
in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable
insights for advancing model design.

Motivation: Existing video QA datasets focus on surface-level comprehension, lacking deeper cognitive understanding of movie content that requires System-2 thinking.

Method: Agentic brainstorming approach using multiple LLMs as thought agents to generate and refine question-answer pairs, plus Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE) module to improve VLM reasoning capabilities.

Result: Created MovieCORE dataset with high-quality cognitive questions, developed evaluation metrics, and achieved up to 25% improvement in VLM reasoning with ACE enhancement.

Conclusion: Advances movie understanding in AI systems, provides insights into VQA model limitations, and offers tools for deeper cognitive video analysis.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to
the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach,
utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights
into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with
more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content. Our project page,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time generative drawing system that combines formal sketch structure with contextual semantic meaning for collaborative AI-human co-creation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond conventional text-prompt generative systems by capturing both geometric features and semantic meaning from sketches, enabling more intuitive human-AI collaboration

Method: Multi-stage generation pipeline that jointly conditions dual intent signals (structural features + semantic cues) using contour-preserving structural control with style/content-aware image synthesis

Result: Low-latency system with touchscreen interface and distributed architecture supporting real-time multi-user collaboration on shared canvases

Conclusion: The platform redefines human-AI interaction as co-creation, enabling synchronous visual creation regardless of artistic expertise

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time generative drawing system that interprets and
integrates both formal intent - the structural, compositional, and stylistic
attributes of a sketch - and contextual intent - the semantic and thematic
meaning inferred from its visual content - into a unified transformation
process. Unlike conventional text-prompt-based generative systems, which
primarily capture high-level contextual descriptions, our approach
simultaneously analyzes ground-level intuitive geometric features such as line
trajectories, proportions, and spatial arrangement, and high-level semantic
cues extracted via vision-language models. These dual intent signals are
jointly conditioned in a multi-stage generation pipeline that combines
contour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image
synthesis. Implemented with a touchscreen-based interface and distributed
inference architecture, the system achieves low-latency, two-stage
transformation while supporting multi-user collaboration on shared canvases.
The resulting platform enables participants, regardless of artistic expertise,
to engage in synchronous, co-authored visual creation, redefining human-AI
interaction as a process of co-creation and mutual enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTF is a training-free temporal token fusion method that enhances Vision-Language-Action models by integrating historical visual information, improving performance across multiple benchmarks without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models process visual inputs frame-by-frame, discarding valuable temporal information and making them vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation tasks.

Method: Temporal Token Fusion (TTF) with dual-dimension detection combining grayscale pixel difference analysis and attention-based semantic relevance assessment, using hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation.

Result: Consistent improvements: 4.0pp average on LIBERO (72.4% vs 68.4% baseline), 4.8% relative improvement on SimplerEnv, and 8.7% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Model-agnostic across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures.

Conclusion: TTF demonstrates that selective temporal fusion enhances VLA performance, revealing that Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms improves rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for computational acceleration with improved success rates.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at
each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic
manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to
visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive
frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a
training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current
visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs
dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference
analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective
temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to
prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO,
SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0
percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline),
cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and
8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves
model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably,
TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances
rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct
KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while
improving task success rates.

Result: Achieved Pearson correlations up to 0.83 with human visual-quality ratings (1.79x to 3.23x stronger than leading vision-language models), demonstrated convergent validity with visual ratings and discriminant validity against speaker-delivery scores.

Conclusion: Augmenting low-level design cues with multimodal embeddings effectively approximates audience perceptions of slide quality, enabling real-time, scalable objective feedback for presentation slides.

Abstract: We present an unsupervised slide-quality assessment pipeline that combines
seven expert-inspired visual-design metrics (whitespace, colorfulness, edge
density, brightness contrast, text density, color harmony, layout balance) with
CLIP-ViT embeddings, using Isolation Forest-based anomaly scoring to evaluate

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient adversarial defense framework for 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation that provides strong protection with minimal computational overhead, outperforming existing methods in both benchmarks and real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR segmentation is critical for autonomous vehicle safety but vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Most defenses focus on raw 3D point clouds and are computationally intensive, while efficient 2D range-view representations lack dedicated lightweight defenses.

Method: Proposes a model-based purification framework with direct attack formulation in range-view domain. Uses an explainable purification network based on mathematically justified optimization problem for efficient adversarial defense.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on open benchmarks, consistently outperforming generative and adversarial training baselines. Real-world deployment on demo vehicle shows accurate operation in practical autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework provides strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for practical deployment in autonomous driving systems using 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation.

Abstract: LiDAR-based segmentation is essential for reliable perception in autonomous
vehicles, yet modern segmentation networks are highly susceptible to
adversarial attacks that can compromise safety. Most existing defenses are
designed for networks operating directly on raw 3D point clouds and rely on
large, computationally intensive generative models. However, many
state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation pipelines operate on more efficient 2D
range view representations. Despite their widespread adoption, dedicated
lightweight adversarial defenses for this domain remain largely unexplored. We
introduce an efficient model-based purification framework tailored for
adversarial defense in 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation. We propose a direct
attack formulation in the range-view domain and develop an explainable
purification network based on a mathematical justified optimization problem,
achieving strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead.
Our method achieves competitive performance on open benchmarks, consistently
outperforming generative and adversarial training baselines. More importantly,
real-world deployment on a demo vehicle demonstrates the framework's ability to
deliver accurate operation in practical autonomous driving scenarios.

*Sauptik Dhar,Nicholas Buoncristiani,Joe Anakata,Haoyu Zhang,Michelle Munson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a two-level fine-tuned LVLM pipeline for generating accurate, stylized sports captions from images, achieving significant improvements over existing methods and demonstrating practical application in live sports journalism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM/LVLMs lack sufficient domain-specific sports jargon to create natural, human-like descriptions of gameplay, limiting their effectiveness in sports caption generation despite their success in other domains.

Method: A two-level fine-tuned large visual language model (LVLM) pipeline specifically designed for sports caption generation from images, focusing on domain-centric sports terminology and stylized formatting.

Result: Achieved >8-10% improvement in F1 score and >2-10% improvement in BERT score compared to alternative approaches. Demonstrated practical application during Super Bowl LIX, generating highly accurate captions at 6 images per 3-5 seconds for over 1000 images.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses the limitations of existing models for sports caption generation, providing production-grade performance with small memory footprint and fast execution time, making it suitable for live sports journalism applications.

Abstract: The advent of large (visual) language models (LLM / LVLM) have led to a
deluge of automated human-like systems in several domains including social
media content generation, search and recommendation, healthcare prognosis, AI
assistants for cognitive tasks etc. Although these systems have been
successfully integrated in production; very little focus has been placed on
sports, particularly accurate identification and natural language description
of the game play. Most existing LLM/LVLMs can explain generic sports
activities, but lack sufficient domain-centric sports' jargon to create natural
(human-like) descriptions. This work highlights the limitations of existing
SoTA LLM/LVLMs for generating production-grade sports captions from images in a
desired stylized format, and proposes a two-level fine-tuned LVLM pipeline to
address that. The proposed pipeline yields an improvement > 8-10% in the F1,
and > 2-10% in BERT score compared to alternative approaches. In addition, it
has a small runtime memory footprint and fast execution time. During Super Bowl
LIX the pipeline proved its practical application for live professional sports
journalism; generating highly accurate and stylized captions at the rate of 6
images per 3-5 seconds for over 1000 images during the game play.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs show demographic biases in face recognition tasks, with PaliGemma and LLaVA exhibiting higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups, while BLIP-2 performs more consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demographic biases remain a critical concern in face recognition systems, as foundation models often fail to perform equitably across diverse demographic groups including ethnicity/race, gender, and age.

Method: Fine-tuned and evaluated three pre-trained LVLMs (LLaVA, BLIP-2, PaliGemma) on a demographic-balanced dataset using metrics like group-specific BERTScores and Fairness Discrepancy Rate to quantify performance disparities.

Result: Experimental results revealed demographic biases in LVLMs, with PaliGemma and LLaVA showing higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups, while BLIP-2 demonstrated comparatively consistent performance.

Conclusion: The study provides compelling insights into the fairness and reliability issues of LVLMs across diverse demographic groups, highlighting the need for bias mitigation in vision-language models for biometric applications.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across various downstream tasks, including biometric face
recognition (FR) with description. However, demographic biases remain a
critical concern in FR, as these foundation models often fail to perform
equitably across diverse demographic groups, considering ethnicity/race,
gender, and age. Therefore, through our work DemoBias, we conduct an empirical
evaluation to investigate the extent of demographic biases in LVLMs for
biometric FR with textual token generation tasks. We fine-tuned and evaluated
three widely used pre-trained LVLMs: LLaVA, BLIP-2, and PaliGemma on our own
generated demographic-balanced dataset. We utilize several evaluation metrics,
like group-specific BERTScores and the Fairness Discrepancy Rate, to quantify
and trace the performance disparities. The experimental results deliver
compelling insights into the fairness and reliability of LVLMs across diverse
demographic groups. Our empirical study uncovered demographic biases in LVLMs,
with PaliGemma and LLaVA exhibiting higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino,
Caucasian, and South Asian groups, whereas BLIP-2 demonstrated comparably
consistent. Repository: https://github.com/Sufianlab/DemoBias.

### [68] [Geo2Vec: Shape- and Distance-Aware Neural Representation of Geospatial Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19305)
*Chen Chu,Cyrus Shahabi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo2Vec is a novel spatial representation learning method that uses signed distance fields to create unified, geometry-aware embeddings for all geo-entity types without decomposition, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial representation methods either handle only single entity types or require decomposition with high computational cost, and they use uniform sampling that blurs fine-grained geometric features like edges and boundaries.

Method: Geo2Vec operates directly in original space using signed distance fields (SDF), adaptively samples points to encode signed distances (positive outside, negative inside), and uses a neural network to approximate SDF. It also includes rotation-invariant positional encoding for high-frequency spatial variations.

Result: Empirical results show Geo2Vec consistently outperforms existing methods in representing shape and location, capturing topological and distance relationships, and achieving greater efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications.

Conclusion: Geo2Vec provides a unified, efficient, and geometry-aware representation method for all geo-entity types that addresses limitations of previous approaches and enables better performance in downstream GeoAI applications.

Abstract: Spatial representation learning is essential for GeoAI applications such as
urban analytics, enabling the encoding of shapes, locations, and spatial
relationships (topological and distance-based) of geo-entities like points,
polylines, and polygons. Existing methods either target a single geo-entity
type or, like Poly2Vec, decompose entities into simpler components to enable
Fourier transformation, introducing high computational cost. Moreover, since
the transformed space lacks geometric alignment, these methods rely on uniform,
non-adaptive sampling, which blurs fine-grained features like edges and
boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geo2Vec, a novel method
inspired by signed distance fields (SDF) that operates directly in the original
space. Geo2Vec adaptively samples points and encodes their signed distances
(positive outside, negative inside), capturing geometry without decomposition.
A neural network trained to approximate the SDF produces compact,
geometry-aware, and unified representations for all geo-entity types.
Additionally, we propose a rotation-invariant positional encoding to model
high-frequency spatial variations and construct a structured and robust
embedding space for downstream GeoAI models. Empirical results show that
Geo2Vec consistently outperforms existing methods in representing shape and
location, capturing topological and distance relationships, and achieving
greater efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications. Code and Data can be found

TL;DR: This study develops automated deep learning systems for rice grain classification and disease diagnosis using CNNs and XAI techniques, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rice is a globally important staple food, but manual quality inspection is labor-intensive and error-prone. There's a need for automated solutions to ensure quality control and yield improvement.

Method: Used CNN for rice grain classification (5 varieties) and combined XAI with deep learning models (CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2) for disease diagnosis. Employed SHAP and LIME for explainability on a dataset of 75,000 images.

Result: Achieved high classification accuracy with minimal misclassifications for rice varieties. Developed accurate diagnostic method for rice leaf diseases (Brown Spot, Blast, Bacterial Blight, Tungro) with enhanced model transparency.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows strong potential in agricultural applications, enabling robust and interpretable systems for automated crop quality inspection and disease diagnosis that benefit farmers, consumers, and the agricultural economy.

Abstract: Rice is a staple food of global importance in terms of trade, nutrition, and
economic growth. Among Asian nations such as China, India, Pakistan, Thailand,
Vietnam and Indonesia are leading producers of both long and short grain
varieties, including basmati, jasmine, arborio, ipsala, and kainat saila. To
ensure consumer satisfaction and strengthen national reputations, monitoring
rice crops and grain quality is essential. Manual inspection, however, is
labour intensive, time consuming and error prone, highlighting the need for
automated solutions for quality control and yield improvement. This study
proposes an automated approach to classify five rice grain varieties using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A publicly available dataset of 75000
images was used for training and testing. Model evaluation employed accuracy,
recall, precision, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Results
demonstrated high classification accuracy with minimal misclassifications,
confirming the model effectiveness in distinguishing rice varieties. In
addition, an accurate diagnostic method for rice leaf diseases such as Brown
Spot, Blast, Bacterial Blight, and Tungro was developed. The framework combined
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with deep learning models including
CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Explainability techniques such as SHAP
(SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations) revealed how specific grain and leaf features influenced
predictions, enhancing model transparency and reliability. The findings
demonstrate the strong potential of deep learning in agricultural applications,
paving the way for robust, interpretable systems that can support automated
crop quality inspection and disease diagnosis, ultimately benefiting farmers,
consumers, and the agricultural economy.

*Mahdis Tourian,Sareh Rowlands,Remy Vandaele,Max Fancourt,Rebecca Mein,Hywel T. P. Williams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using ground-level photos to classify 18 habitat types with good accuracy, enabling scalable ecological monitoring through citizen science imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional habitat classification relies on satellite imagery with field validation, which is limited in scale. Ground-level imagery offers better validation and scalability through citizen science.

Method: Developed DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier using ground-level photographs, with preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation) and class balancing through re-sampling. Five-fold cross-validation used for evaluation.

Result: Model achieved mean F1-score of 0.61 across 18 habitat classes, with visually distinct habitats (Bare Soil, Silt and Peat; Bare Sand) scoring above 0.90, while mixed/ambiguous classes performed lower.

Conclusion: Ground-level imagery combined with deep learning enables accurate habitat classification at scale, with practical applications for ecological monitoring. A web application was developed to support practitioner use.

Abstract: Accurate classification of terrestrial habitats is critical for biodiversity
conservation, ecological monitoring, and land-use planning. Several habitat
classification schemes are in use, typically based on analysis of satellite
imagery with validation by field ecologists. Here we present a methodology for
classification of habitats based solely on ground-level imagery (photographs),
offering improved validation and the ability to classify habitats at scale (for
example using citizen-science imagery). In collaboration with Natural England,
a public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England,
this study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to
ground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18
classes defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed
using resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to
balance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed
and fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label
to each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated
strong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and
F1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean
F1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and
Peat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or
ambiguous classes scoring lower. These findings demonstrate the potential of
this approach for ecological monitoring. Ground-level imagery is readily
obtained, and accurate computational methods for habitat classification based
on such data have many potential applications. To support use by practitioners,
we also provide a simple web application that classifies uploaded images using
our model.

*Ming Chen,Liyuan Cui,Wenyuan Zhang,Haoxian Zhang,Yan Zhou,Xiaohan Li,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An autoregressive video generation framework for interactive digital humans that supports multimodal control (audio, pose, text) with low latency and high efficiency using LLM modifications and deep compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive digital human video generation methods suffer from high latency, heavy computational costs, and limited controllability, making real-time interaction challenging.

Method: Autoregressive framework with minimal LLM modifications to accept multimodal condition encodings, using a diffusion head for denoising and a deep compression autoencoder (64× reduction) to reduce inference burden. Trained on 20K-hour dialogue dataset.

Result: Achieves low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability in duplex conversations, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world modeling scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in interactive digital human generation by enabling real-time multimodal control with minimal computational overhead through innovative compression and autoregressive design.

Abstract: Recently, interactive digital human video generation has attracted widespread
attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, building such a practical
system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains
challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy
computational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an
autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal
control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal
modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts
multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs
spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising
process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing
rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep
compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which
effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive
model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human
synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach
in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey paper explores digital watermarking and steganography as post-capture protection for ICAO-compliant facial images to combat morphing and deepfakes, while maintaining compliance standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICAO-compliant facial images are vulnerable to morphing and deepfake attacks for identity theft, and traditional real-time detection methods offer no post-capture protection.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art digital watermarking and steganography techniques that embed tamper-evident signals directly into images without compromising ICAO compliance.

Result: Evaluation of potential and drawbacks of various approaches, highlighting key trade-offs for secure deployment in real-world identity verification systems.

Conclusion: Digital watermarking and steganography provide effective complementary solutions for persistent verification of ICAO-compliant images, offering guidance for secure implementation in identity systems.

Abstract: ICAO-compliant facial images, initially designed for secure biometric
passports, are increasingly becoming central to identity verification in a wide
range of application contexts, including border control, digital travel
credentials, and financial services. While their standardization enables global
interoperability, it also facilitates practices such as morphing and deepfakes,
which can be exploited for harmful purposes like identity theft and illegal
sharing of identity documents. Traditional countermeasures like Presentation
Attack Detection (PAD) are limited to real-time capture and offer no
post-capture protection. This survey paper investigates digital watermarking
and steganography as complementary solutions that embed tamper-evident signals
directly into the image, enabling persistent verification without compromising
ICAO compliance. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art techniques to evaluate the potential and drawbacks of the
underlying approaches concerning the applications involving ICAO-compliant
images and their suitability under standard constraints. We highlight key
trade-offs, offering guidance for secure deployment in real-world identity
systems.

*Haoyang Su,Jin-Yi Xiang,Shaohao Rui,Yifan Gao,Xingyu Chen,Tingxuan Yin,Xiaosong Wang,Lian-Ming Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a self-supervised framework that integrates cardiac MRI imaging with EHR data using prompt-guided representation learning for improved prediction of major adverse cardiac events, outperforming traditional survival models and identifying novel cardiac risk signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains challenging in cardiovascular prognosis, requiring better integration of multimodal clinical data including imaging and electronic health records.

Method: PRISM uses motion-aware multi-view distillation to extract temporally synchronized imaging features from cardiac cine MRI and modulates them with medically informed textual prompts, integrating with structured EHR data for survival analysis.

Result: PRISM consistently outperformed classical survival models and state-of-the-art deep learning baselines across four independent clinical cohorts in both internal and external validation. It identified three distinct imaging signatures associated with elevated MACE risk and revealed hypertension, diabetes, and smoking as dominant risk factors.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates multimodal clinical data to provide fine-grained cardiac risk prediction and valuable clinical insights, demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt-guided representation learning for survival analysis in cardiovascular medicine.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains a central
challenge in cardiovascular prognosis. We present PRISM (Prompt-guided
Representation Integration for Survival Modeling), a self-supervised framework
that integrates visual representations from non-contrast cardiac cine magnetic
resonance imaging with structured electronic health records (EHRs) for survival
analysis. PRISM extracts temporally synchronized imaging features through
motion-aware multi-view distillation and modulates them using medically
informed textual prompts to enable fine-grained risk prediction. Across four
independent clinical cohorts, PRISM consistently surpasses classical survival
prediction models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning baselines under
internal and external validation. Further clinical findings demonstrate that
the combined imaging and EHR representations derived from PRISM provide
valuable insights into cardiac risk across diverse cohorts. Three distinct
imaging signatures associated with elevated MACE risk are uncovered, including
lateral wall dyssynchrony, inferior wall hypersensitivity, and anterior
elevated focus during diastole. Prompt-guided attribution further identifies
hypertension, diabetes, and smoking as dominant contributors among clinical and
physiological EHR factors.

*Mahdieh Behjat Khatooni,Mohsen Soryani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EffNetViTLoRA model combines CNN and Vision Transformer with LoRA adaptation for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using full ADNI MRI dataset, achieving 92.52% accuracy across AD, MCI, and CN categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial as it's irreversible. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnosis is challenging due to subtle differences between diagnostic categories, and previous studies used limited data subsets.

Method: Integrated CNN with Vision Transformer to capture both local and global features from MRI images. Used full ADNI T1-weighted MRI dataset. Incorporated Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to adapt pretrained ViT model to target domain for efficient knowledge transfer and reduced overfitting.

Result: Achieved 92.52% classification accuracy and 92.76% F1-score across three diagnostic categories (AD, MCI, CN) using the full ADNI dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed EffNetViTLoRA model provides a robust and unbiased approach for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating high accuracy and clinical reliability through comprehensive data usage and effective domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative
disorders worldwide. As it progresses, it leads to the deterioration of
cognitive functions. Since AD is irreversible, early diagnosis is crucial for
managing its progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents an
intermediate stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals and those with
AD, and is considered a transitional phase from normal cognition to Alzheimer's
disease. Diagnosing MCI is particularly challenging due to the subtle
differences between adjacent diagnostic categories. In this study, we propose
EffNetViTLoRA, a generalized end-to-end model for AD diagnosis using the whole
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) dataset. Our model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture both local and global features from MRI
images. Unlike previous studies that rely on limited subsets of data, our
approach is trained on the full T1-weighted MRI dataset from ADNI, resulting in
a more robust and unbiased model. This comprehensive methodology enhances the
model's clinical reliability. Furthermore, fine-tuning large pretrained models
often yields suboptimal results when source and target dataset domains differ.
To address this, we incorporate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to effectively adapt
the pretrained ViT model to our target domain. This method enables efficient
knowledge transfer and reduces the risk of overfitting. Our model achieves a
classification accuracy of 92.52% and an F1-score of 92.76% across three
diagnostic categories: AD, MCI, and CN for full ADNI dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Computer-vision AI tracking systems show fair precision for player position and speed measurement using broadcast footage, with tactical feed recommended for optimal accuracy and both 720p/1080p resolutions being suitable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the accuracy of commercial computer-vision AI player tracking software using broadcast footage and determine the impact of camera feed type and resolution on measurement precision.

Method: Used data from one 2022 FIFA World Cup match with tactical, programme, and camera 1 feeds. Three commercial tracking providers analyzed player position (x,y coordinates) and speed, compared against TRACAB Gen 5 multi-camera system as ground truth. Calculated RMSE and mean bias metrics.

Result: Position RMSE ranged 1.68-16.39m, speed RMSE 0.34-2.38 m/s. Total match distance mean bias varied from -1745m (-21.8%) to 1945m (24.3%). Tactical feed provided best accuracy by maximizing player detection.

Conclusion: Computer-vision AI tracking offers fair precision when players are detected. Tactical feed is recommended for position and speed tracking, and both 720p/1080p resolutions are adequate with proper AI models.

Abstract: This study aimed to: (1) understand whether commercially available
computer-vision and artificial intelligence (AI) player tracking software can
accurately measure player position, speed and distance using broadcast footage
and (2) determine the impact of camera feed and resolution on accuracy. Data
were obtained from one match at the 2022 Qatar Federation Internationale de
Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. Tactical, programme and camera 1 feeds
were used. Three commercial tracking providers that use computer-vision and AI
participated. Providers analysed instantaneous position (x, y coordinates) and
speed (m\,s^{-1}) of each player. Their data were compared with a
high-definition multi-camera tracking system (TRACAB Gen 5). Root mean square
error (RMSE) and mean bias were calculated. Position RMSE ranged from 1.68 to
16.39 m, while speed RMSE ranged from 0.34 to 2.38 m\,s^{-1}. Total match
distance mean bias ranged from -1745 m (-21.8%) to 1945 m (24.3%) across
providers. Computer-vision and AI player tracking software offer the ability to
track players with fair precision when players are detected by the software.
Providers should use a tactical feed when tracking position and speed, which
will maximise player detection, improving accuracy. Both 720p and 1080p
resolutions are suitable, assuming appropriate computer-vision and AI models
are implemented.

*Xinlong Zhao,Qixiang Pang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JVLGS is a novel vision-language framework that integrates visual and textual modalities to improve gas leak segmentation, addressing challenges like blurry gas clouds and false positives through post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gas leaks pose serious health and environmental threats, but current detection methods are limited by the blurry, non-rigid nature of gas clouds and lack effective techniques for accurate identification.

Method: Proposes Joint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS) framework that combines visual and textual information, includes post-processing to reduce false positives from noise and non-target objects.

Result: Extensive experiments show JVLGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios, achieving strong performance in both supervised and few-shot learning settings.

Conclusion: The proposed JVLGS framework effectively addresses gas leak detection challenges by leveraging multimodal integration and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in various learning settings.

Abstract: Gas leaks pose serious threats to human health and contribute significantly
to atmospheric pollution, drawing increasing public concern. However, the lack
of effective detection methods hampers timely and accurate identification of
gas leaks. While some vision-based techniques leverage infrared videos for leak
detection, the blurry and non-rigid nature of gas clouds often limits their
effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called
Joint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS), which integrates the
complementary strengths of visual and textual modalities to enhance gas leak
representation and segmentation. Recognizing that gas leaks are sporadic and
many video frames may contain no leak at all, our method incorporates a
post-processing step to reduce false positives caused by noise and non-target
objects, an issue that affects many existing approaches. Extensive experiments
conducted across diverse scenarios show that JVLGS significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art gas leak segmentation methods. We evaluate our model under
both supervised and few-shot learning settings, and it consistently achieves
strong performance in both, whereas competing methods tend to perform well in
only one setting or poorly in both. Code available at:

*Yimu Wang,Weiming Zhuang,Chen Chen,Jiabo Huang,Jingtao Li,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNIFORM is a framework that transfers knowledge from diverse pre-trained models into a single student model using voting mechanisms at both logit and feature levels, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require specific model types and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage the collective knowledge from numerous diverse pre-trained models available online, which provide unique interpretations of the real world, but current integration methods have strong assumptions about data distributions and architectures that limit their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a voting mechanism to capture consensus at both logit level (for models predicting target classes) and feature level (using visual representations from arbitrary label spaces), enabling knowledge transfer without architectural or data distribution constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show UNIFORM significantly enhances unsupervised object recognition performance compared to strong baselines, with remarkable scalability that benefits from over 100 teachers while existing methods saturate at much smaller scales.

Conclusion: UNIFORM effectively harnesses collective knowledge from diverse pre-trained models through a flexible voting mechanism, demonstrating superior performance and scalability in knowledge transfer without the constraints of previous approaches.

Abstract: In the era of deep learning, the increasing number of pre-trained models
available online presents a wealth of knowledge. These models, developed with
diverse architectures and trained on varied datasets for different tasks,
provide unique interpretations of the real world. Their collective consensus is
likely universal and generalizable to unseen data. However, effectively
harnessing this collective knowledge poses a fundamental challenge due to the
heterogeneity of pre-trained models. Existing knowledge integration solutions
typically rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and
network architectures, limiting them to learning only from specific types of
models and resulting in data and/or inductive biases. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework, namely UNIFORM, for knowledge transfer from a
diverse set of off-the-shelf models into one student model without such
constraints. Specifically, we propose a dedicated voting mechanism to capture
the consensus of knowledge both at the logit level -- incorporating teacher
models that are capable of predicting target classes of interest -- and at the
feature level, utilizing visual representations learned on arbitrary label
spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIFORM effectively enhances
unsupervised object recognition performance compared to strong knowledge
transfer baselines. Notably, it exhibits remarkable scalability by benefiting
from over one hundred teachers, while existing methods saturate at a much
smaller scale.

*Xiangxu Wang,Tianhong Zhao,Wei Tu,Bowen Zhang,Guanzhou Chen,Jinzhou Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2Flow is a diffusion-based framework that generates structurally coherent Origin-Destination flow matrices using only satellite imagery, eliminating the need for costly auxiliary data and maintaining robustness to spatial index reordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OD flow generation methods rely on expensive auxiliary features with limited coverage and are sensitive to spatial topology changes like regional index reordering, which disrupts structural coherence.

Method: Uses a multi-kernel encoder to capture diverse regional interactions and a permutation-aware diffusion process that aligns latent representations across different regional orderings. Combines joint contrastive training with equivariant diffusion training for structural consistency.

Result: Outperforms physics-based and data-driven baselines in numerical accuracy while preserving empirical distributions and spatial structures under index permutations on real-world urban datasets.

Conclusion: Sat2Flow provides a globally scalable solution for OD flow generation in data-scarce environments, eliminating region-specific auxiliary data dependencies while maintaining structural invariance for robust mobility modeling.

Abstract: Origin-Destination (OD) flow matrices are essential for urban mobility
analysis, underpinning applications in traffic forecasting, infrastructure
planning, and policy design. However, existing methods suffer from two critical
limitations: (1) reliance on auxiliary features (e.g., Points of Interest,
socioeconomic statistics) that are costly to collect and have limited spatial
coverage; and (2) sensitivity to spatial topology, where minor index reordering
of urban regions (e.g., census tract relabeling) disrupts structural coherence
in generated flows. To address these challenges, we propose Sat2Flow, a latent
structure-aware diffusion-based framework that generates structurally coherent
OD flows using solely satellite imagery as input. Our approach introduces a
multi-kernel encoder to capture diverse regional interactions and employs a
permutation-aware diffusion process that aligns latent representations across
different regional orderings. Through a joint contrastive training objective
that bridges satellite-derived features with OD patterns, combined with
equivariant diffusion training that enforces structural consistency, Sat2Flow
ensures topological robustness under arbitrary regional reindexing.
Experimental results on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that Sat2Flow
outperforms both physics-based and data-driven baselines in numerical accuracy
while preserving empirical distributions and spatial structures under index
permutations. Sat2Flow offers a globally scalable solution for OD flow
generation in data-scarce urban environments, eliminating region-specific
auxiliary data dependencies while maintaining structural invariance for robust
mobility modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semi-supervised framework for weed detection that addresses shadow bias and annotation costs, achieving strong performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated weed management faces challenges from environmental conditions and high annotation costs, requiring robust computer vision systems that work in real-world agricultural settings.

Method: Diagnostic-driven semi-supervised approach using interpretability tools to identify shadow bias, then leveraging unlabeled data through pseudo-labeling to train more robust classification (ResNet) and detection (YOLO, RF-DETR) models.

Result: Achieved F1 scores up to 0.90 and mAP50 scores exceeding 0.82, with improved recall critical for minimizing weed escapes in automated spraying systems. Validated effectiveness in low-data regime on public benchmark.

Conclusion: Provides a field-tested framework for developing, diagnosing, and improving robust computer vision systems for precision agriculture that addresses real-world challenges like shadow bias and data scarcity.

Abstract: The automated management of invasive weeds is critical for sustainable
agriculture, yet the performance of deep learning models in real-world fields
is often compromised by two factors: challenging environmental conditions and
the high cost of data annotation. This study tackles both issues through a
diagnostic-driven, semi-supervised framework. Using a unique dataset of
approximately 975 labeled and 10,000 unlabeled images of Guinea Grass in
sugarcane, we first establish strong supervised baselines for classification
(ResNet) and detection (YOLO, RF-DETR), achieving F1 scores up to 0.90 and
mAP50 scores exceeding 0.82. Crucially, this foundational analysis, aided by
interpretability tools, uncovered a pervasive "shadow bias," where models
learned to misidentify shadows as vegetation. This diagnostic insight motivated
our primary contribution: a semi-supervised pipeline that leverages unlabeled
data to enhance model robustness. By training models on a more diverse set of
visual information through pseudo-labeling, this framework not only helps
mitigate the shadow bias but also provides a tangible boost in recall, a
critical metric for minimizing weed escapes in automated spraying systems. To
validate our methodology, we demonstrate its effectiveness in a low-data regime
on a public crop-weed benchmark. Our work provides a clear and field-tested
framework for developing, diagnosing, and improving robust computer vision
systems for the complex realities of precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPO and MotionFLUX framework for real-time text-to-motion generation with improved semantic alignment and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current text-driven motion generation methods, including poor semantic alignment between text descriptions and motion semantics, and slow multi-step inference processes.

Method: Introduces TAPO (Aligned Preference Optimization) for semantic grounding of motion variations with text modifiers, and MotionFLUX - a high-speed generation framework using deterministic rectified flow matching that constructs optimal transport paths between noise distributions and motion spaces.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both semantic consistency and motion quality while significantly accelerating generation speed, enabling real-time synthesis.

Conclusion: The unified TAPO and MotionFLUX system provides superior motion generation with precise text-motion alignment and real-time performance, overcoming key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Motion generation is essential for animating virtual characters and embodied
agents. While recent text-driven methods have made significant strides, they
often struggle with achieving precise alignment between linguistic descriptions
and motion semantics, as well as with the inefficiencies of slow, multi-step
inference. To address these issues, we introduce TMR++ Aligned Preference
Optimization (TAPO), an innovative framework that aligns subtle motion
variations with textual modifiers and incorporates iterative adjustments to
reinforce semantic grounding. To further enable real-time synthesis, we propose
MotionFLUX, a high-speed generation framework based on deterministic rectified
flow matching. Unlike traditional diffusion models, which require hundreds of
denoising steps, MotionFLUX constructs optimal transport paths between noise
distributions and motion spaces, facilitating real-time synthesis. The
linearized probability paths reduce the need for multi-step sampling typical of
sequential methods, significantly accelerating inference time without
sacrificing motion quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, together,
TAPO and MotionFLUX form a unified system that outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches in both semantic consistency and motion quality, while also
accelerating generation speed. The code and pretrained models will be released.

TL;DR: CVBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating cross-video relational reasoning in MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps compared to human capabilities and identifying architectural limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show strong performance on single-video tasks but their ability to reason across multiple videos remains underexplored, despite being essential for real-world applications like multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning.

Method: Developed CVBench with 1,000 question-answer pairs across three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association, cross-video event association, and cross-video complex reasoning. Built from five domain-diverse video clusters and evaluated 10+ leading MLLMs under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Significant performance gaps observed - top models like GPT-4o achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks compared to 91% human performance. Fundamental bottlenecks identified include deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities.

Conclusion: CVBench provides a rigorous framework for diagnosing multi-video reasoning limitations and offers architectural insights for developing next-generation MLLMs capable of effective cross-video relational reasoning.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on
single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their ability across
multiple videos remains critically underexplored. However, this capability is
essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and
cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the
first comprehensive benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational
reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning
three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared
entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event
chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain
knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life
records), the benchmark challenges models to synthesise information across
dynamic visual contexts. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including
GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought
prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top
models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks,
compared to the 91% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis
reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLM architectures, notably
deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping
entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for diagnosing and advancing
multi-video reasoning, offering architectural insights for next-generation
MLLMs.The data and evaluation code are available at

Conclusion: WebEyeTrack successfully bridges the gap between academic benchmarks and practical applications by providing accurate, fast, and privacy-preserving gaze estimation that adapts to new users with minimal calibration.

Abstract: With advancements in AI, new gaze estimation methods are exceeding
state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, but their real-world application reveals a
gap with commercial eye-tracking solutions. Factors like model size, inference
time, and privacy often go unaddressed. Meanwhile, webcam-based eye-tracking

TL;DR: MonoRelief V2 is an end-to-end model for 2.5D relief recovery from single images, improved with real data training and outperforms previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of synthetic-only training in MonoRelief V1 and improve robustness against complex material and illumination variations in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses text-to-image generative model to create 15,000 pseudo-real images with depth pseudo-labels, builds 800-sample real dataset via multi-view reconstruction, and employs progressive training on both datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both depth and normal predictions, demonstrating improved robustness, accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: MonoRelief V2 shows strong potential for downstream applications and represents a significant advancement in single-image 2.5D relief recovery under challenging conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents MonoRelief V2, an end-to-end model designed for directly
recovering 2.5D reliefs from single images under complex material and
illumination variations. In contrast to its predecessor, MonoRelief V1 [1],
which was solely trained on synthetic data, MonoRelief V2 incorporates real
data to achieve improved robustness, accuracy and efficiency. To overcome the
challenge of acquiring large-scale real-world dataset, we generate
approximately 15,000 pseudo real images using a text-to-image generative model,
and derive corresponding depth pseudo-labels through fusion of depth and normal
predictions. Furthermore, we construct a small-scale real-world dataset (800
samples) via multi-view reconstruction and detail refinement. MonoRelief V2 is
then progressively trained on the pseudo-real and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDet is a high-speed NMS-free object detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance on intersection traffic monitoring with 63.2% reduced computation and 16.2% faster inference than RT-DETR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end object detectors are promising for real-time applications but face high computational costs, especially in complex scenarios like intersection traffic monitoring with severe occlusion and high object density.

Method: Proposes FlowDet with decoupled encoder optimization for DETR architecture, featuring Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module for handling extreme scale variations.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on Intersection-Flow-5k dataset: improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6% over RT-DETR, while reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a path towards highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding real-world perception systems, with the new Intersection-Flow-5k dataset available for challenging traffic monitoring evaluation.

Abstract: End-to-end object detectors offer a promising NMS-free paradigm for real-time
applications, yet their high computational cost remains a significant barrier,
particularly for complex scenarios like intersection traffic monitoring. To
address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a
decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture.
Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for
traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to
maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To
rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe
occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k
dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on
Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to
the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by
1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference
speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly
efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems.

*Luhu Li,Bowen Lin,Mukhtiar Khan,Shujun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework combining trainable encoder with prototype-guided reconstruction and diversity-aware loss to prevent prototype collapse in medical anomaly detection, improving localization accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing reconstruction methods that use frozen pre-trained encoders (limiting domain adaptation) and prototype-based learning that suffers from prototype collapse (reducing diversity and generalization) in medical image anomaly detection.

Method: Propose trainable encoder with momentum branch for domain-adaptive feature learning, lightweight Prototype Extractor to mine normal prototypes for attention-guided reconstruction, and Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss with diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization to prevent collapse.

Result: Significant improvements in representation quality and anomaly localization across multiple medical imaging benchmarks, outperforming prior methods. Visualizations and prototype assignment analyses validate anti-collapse mechanism effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses prototype collapse and domain adaptation issues, enhancing both performance and interpretability in medical image anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is challenging due to limited annotations
and a domain gap compared to natural images. Existing reconstruction methods
often rely on frozen pre-trained encoders, which limits adaptation to
domain-specific features and reduces localization accuracy. Prototype-based
learning offers interpretability and clustering benefits but suffers from
prototype collapse, where few prototypes dominate training, harming diversity
and generalization. To address this, we propose a unified framework combining a
trainable encoder with prototype-guided reconstruction and a novel
Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss. The trainable encoder, enhanced by a momentum
branch, enables stable domain-adaptive feature learning. A lightweight
Prototype Extractor mines informative normal prototypes to guide the decoder
via attention for precise reconstruction. Our loss enforces balanced prototype
use through diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization, effectively
preventing collapse. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show
significant improvements in representation quality and anomaly localization,
outperforming prior methods. Visualizations and prototype assignment analyses
further validate the effectiveness of our anti-collapse mechanism and enhanced
interpretability.

*Mingxi Fu,Fanglei Fu,Xitong Ling,Huaitian Yuan,Tian Guan,Yonghong He,Lianghui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPAMatch is a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework that uses multimodal prototype-guided contrastive learning with both image and text prototypes to improve pathological image segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathological image segmentation faces challenges due to ambiguous semantic boundaries and expensive pixel-level annotations. Existing semi-supervised methods relying on perturbation-based consistency struggle to capture high-level semantic priors in complex pathology images.

Method: Proposes MPAMatch with dual contrastive learning between image prototypes and pixel labels, and text prototypes and pixel labels. Replaces ViT backbone with pathology-pretrained Uni foundation model for better feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND, EBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI datasets show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MPAMatch provides dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling through its multimodal prototype-guided supervision, significantly improving semantic boundary modeling in pathological image segmentation.

Abstract: Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly due
to ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations.
Although recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization
(e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely on
perturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficult
to capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complex
pathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel
segmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a
multimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of
MPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes
and pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing
supervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine
supervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on
unlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into
segmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary
modeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture
(TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained
foundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of
pathology-relevant features. Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND,
EBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, validating its dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling.

*Zhu Xu,Zhaowen Wang,Yuxin Peng,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CHOI task for customized human-object interaction image generation with identity preservation and interaction control, introduces Interact-Custom model with spatial configuration modeling and two-stage generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on appearance preservation but neglect fine-grained interaction control between target entities, limiting practical applications.

Method: Process large-scale dataset with human-object pairs in different poses, design Interact-Custom model with two stages: spatial configuration modeling via foreground masks, then identity-preserving generation under mask guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness on tailored CHOI metrics, achieving simultaneous identity preservation and interaction semantic control.

Conclusion: Interact-Custom successfully addresses CHOI challenges by decomposing features and modeling spatial configurations, providing high content controllability for customized human-object interaction generation.

Abstract: Compositional Customized Image Generation aims to customize multiple target
concepts within generation content, which has gained attention for its wild
application.Existing approaches mainly concentrate on the target entity's
appearance preservation, while neglecting the fine-grained interaction control
among target entities.To enable the model of such interaction control
capability, we focus on human object interaction scenario and propose the task
of Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation(CHOI), which
simultaneously requires identity preservation for target human object and the
interaction semantic control between them.Two primary challenges exist for
CHOI:(1)simultaneous identity preservation and interaction control demands
require the model to decompose the human object into self-contained identity
features and pose-oriented interaction features, while the current HOI image
datasets fail to provide ideal samples for such feature-decomposed
learning.(2)inappropriate spatial configuration between human and object may
lead to the lack of desired interaction semantics.To tackle it, we first
process a large-scale dataset, where each sample encompasses the same pair of
human object involving different interactive poses.Then we design a two-stage
model Interact-Custom, which firstly explicitly models the spatial
configuration by generating a foreground mask depicting the interaction
behavior, then under the guidance of this mask, we generate the target human
object interacting while preserving their identities features.Furthermore, if
the background image and the union location of where the target human object
should appear are provided by users, Interact-Custom also provides the optional
functionality to specify them, offering high content controllability. Extensive
experiments on our tailored metrics for CHOI task demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach.

*Haomiao Zhang,Miao Cao,Xuan Yu,Hui Luo,Yanling Piao,Mengjie Qin,Zhangyuan Li,Ping Wang,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SGDDM for high-fidelity full-color holographic display at high frame rates and HoloMamba for efficient 260+ FPS holographic video generation, overcoming color crosstalk and computational inefficiency in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-generated holography faces trade-offs between frame rate and color fidelity due to over-smoothed phases causing color crosstalk, and existing methods neglect spatial-temporal correlations making computations inefficient.

Method: Two-part approach: 1) Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM) optimizes phase distributions via frequency modulation, 2) HoloMamba - a lightweight asymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that models spatial-temporal correlations across video sequences.

Result: SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without frame rate compromise. HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color holographic video at over 260 FPS, 2.6x faster than prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key limitations in holographic video generation, enabling both high frame rates and color fidelity while significantly improving computational efficiency through spatial-temporal modeling.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising technology for
next-generation displays. However, generating high-speed, high-quality
holographic video requires both high frame rate display and efficient
computation, but is constrained by two key limitations: ($i$) Learning-based
models often produce over-smoothed phases with narrow angular spectra, causing
severe color crosstalk in high frame rate full-color displays such as
depth-division multiplexing and thus resulting in a trade-off between frame
rate and color fidelity. ($ii$) Existing frame-by-frame optimization methods
typically optimize frames independently, neglecting spatial-temporal
correlations between consecutive frames and leading to computationally
inefficient solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose
a novel high-speed full-color video CGH generation scheme. First, we introduce
Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM), which optimizes phase
distributions via frequency modulation, enabling high-fidelity full-color
display at high frame rates. Second, we present HoloMamba, a lightweight
asymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that explicitly models spatial-temporal
correlations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and
computational efficiency. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments
demonstrate that SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without
compromise in frame rate, while HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color
holographic video at over 260 FPS, more than 2.6$\times$ faster than the prior
state-of-the-art Divide-Conquer-and-Merge Strategy.

*Dat Nguyen Cong,Hieu Tran Bao,Hoang Thanh-Tung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SBDC is a guidance technique that corrects errors in pre-trained diffusion models using discriminator training with adversarial loss, improving generation quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large datasets used for diffusion models often contain labeling errors that compromise generative capabilities and controllability, but the impact of these errors is not well studied.

Method: Score-based Discriminator Correction (SBDC) uses discriminator training with adversarial loss and prior noise detection techniques to assess sample authenticity, with guidance limited to early generation phases.

Result: SBDC is computationally efficient, only marginally increases inference time, and demonstrates superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods in different noise settings.

Conclusion: The proposed SBDC method effectively aligns noisy pre-trained conditional diffusion models without requiring retraining, improving performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have gained prominence as state-of-the-art techniques for
synthesizing images and videos, particularly due to their ability to scale
effectively with large datasets. Recent studies have uncovered that these
extensive datasets often contain mistakes from manual labeling processes.
However, the extent to which such errors compromise the generative capabilities
and controllability of diffusion models is not well studied. This paper
introduces Score-based Discriminator Correction (SBDC), a guidance technique
for aligning noisy pre-trained conditional diffusion models. The guidance is
built on discriminator training using adversarial loss, drawing on prior noise
detection techniques to assess the authenticity of each sample. We further show
that limiting the usage of our guidance to the early phase of the generation
process leads to better performance. Our method is computationally efficient,
only marginally increases inference time, and does not require retraining
diffusion models. Experiments on different noise settings demonstrate the
superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.

### [91] [Generalizing Monocular 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19593)
*Abhinav Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis addresses generalization challenges in monocular 3D object detection by proposing four novel approaches: differentiable NMS for occlusion robustness, depth equivariant backbones for dataset generalization, segmentation-based detection for large objects, and mathematical analysis for camera parameter extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, but existing models struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios including occlusions, different datasets, varying object sizes, and camera parameters.

Method: Four main approaches: 1) GrooMeD-NMS - mathematically differentiable NMS for occlusion robustness; 2) DEVIANT - depth equivariant backbones for dataset generalization; 3) SeaBird - segmentation-based approach with dice loss in bird's-eye view for large object detection; 4) Mathematical analysis of camera parameter extrapolation.

Result: The proposed methods address key generalization challenges: improved occlusion handling, better adaptation to new datasets, enhanced detection of large objects (addressing noise sensitivity beyond data imbalance), and better performance with unseen camera parameters.

Conclusion: This thesis provides comprehensive solutions for improving monocular 3D object detection generalization across multiple challenging scenarios, making the technology more robust and applicable to real-world diverse environments and conditions.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) is a fundamental computer vision task
that estimates an object's class, 3D position, dimensions, and orientation from
a single image. Its applications, including autonomous driving, augmented
reality, and robotics, critically rely on accurate 3D environmental
understanding. This thesis addresses the challenge of generalizing Mono3D
models to diverse scenarios, including occlusions, datasets, object sizes, and
camera parameters. To enhance occlusion robustness, we propose a mathematically
differentiable NMS (GrooMeD-NMS). To improve generalization to new datasets, we
explore depth equivariant (DEVIANT) backbones. We address the issue of large
object detection, demonstrating that it's not solely a data imbalance or
receptive field problem but also a noise sensitivity issue. To mitigate this,
we introduce a segmentation-based approach in bird's-eye view with dice loss
(SeaBird). Finally, we mathematically analyze the extrapolation of Mono3D
models to unseen camera heights and improve Mono3D generalization in such
out-of-distribution settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study evaluates YOLO model robustness across quantization formats, tests degradation-aware calibration for INT8 quantization, finds limited robustness improvements except for larger models under specific noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training quantization is essential for deploying object detection models on resource-constrained devices, but the impact of reduced precision on model robustness to real-world input degradations (noise, blur, compression artifacts) is a significant concern that needs investigation.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study evaluating YOLO models (nano to extra-large scales) across multiple precision formats (FP32, FP16, Dynamic UINT8, Static INT8). Introduced degradation-aware calibration strategy for Static INT8 PTQ where TensorRT calibration is exposed to mix of clean and synthetically degraded images. Benchmarking on COCO dataset under seven degradation conditions and mixed-degradation scenario.

Result: Static INT8 TensorRT engines offer substantial speedups (1.5-3.3x) with moderate accuracy drop (3-7% mAP50-95) on clean data. Degradation-aware calibration did not yield consistent, broad robustness improvements over standard clean-data calibration across most models and degradations. Notable exception: larger model scales under specific noise conditions showed improved efficacy.

Conclusion: The findings highlight challenges in enhancing PTQ robustness and provide insights for deploying quantized detectors in uncontrolled environments. Model capacity may influence calibration approach efficacy, with larger models showing better results under specific conditions.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is crucial for deploying efficient object
detection models, like YOLO, on resource-constrained devices. However, the
impact of reduced precision on model robustness to real-world input
degradations such as noise, blur, and compression artifacts is a significant
concern. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
robustness of YOLO models (nano to extra-large scales) across multiple
precision formats: FP32, FP16 (TensorRT), Dynamic UINT8 (ONNX), and Static INT8
(TensorRT). We introduce and evaluate a degradation-aware calibration strategy
for Static INT8 PTQ, where the TensorRT calibration process is exposed to a mix
of clean and synthetically degraded images. Models were benchmarked on the COCO
dataset under seven distinct degradation conditions (including various types
and levels of noise, blur, low contrast, and JPEG compression) and a
mixed-degradation scenario. Results indicate that while Static INT8 TensorRT
engines offer substantial speedups (~1.5-3.3x) with a moderate accuracy drop
(~3-7% mAP50-95) on clean data, the proposed degradation-aware calibration did
not yield consistent, broad improvements in robustness over standard clean-data
calibration across most models and degradations. A notable exception was
observed for larger model scales under specific noise conditions, suggesting
model capacity may influence the efficacy of this calibration approach. These
findings highlight the challenges in enhancing PTQ robustness and provide
insights for deploying quantized detectors in uncontrolled environments. All

*Qizhe Fan,Chaoyu Liu,Zhonghua Qiao,Xiaoqin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IELDM and IELFormer frameworks that integrate inverse evolution layers (IELs) into diffusion models and segmentation networks to improve domain generalization in semantic segmentation by filtering flawed synthetic data and suppressing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based data augmentation for domain generalized semantic segmentation often produces images with structural/semantic defects, leading to performance degradation and error accumulation when training segmentation models.

Method: Introduces inverse evolution layers (IELs) using Laplacian-based priors to highlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies. Proposes IELDM for higher-quality image generation and IELFormer segmentation network with embedded IELs in decoder plus multi-scale frequency fusion module for cross-scale coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior generalization performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The integration of IELs into both generative process and segmentation network effectively addresses defect issues in synthetic data and improves cross-domain generalization capability in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) focuses on training a model
using labeled data from a source domain, with the goal of achieving robust
generalization to unseen target domains during inference. A common approach to
improve generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data
generated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often
contain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training
segmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation
and error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse
evolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to
highlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using
Laplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable
generative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced
diffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality
images. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs
can also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation.
Based on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and
propose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain
scenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across
scales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module,
which performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of
multi-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior generalization performance compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical skin images are often limited, creating data shortages for deep learning models. Existing synthesis methods produce low-quality images and lack control over lesion location and type.

Method: Uses a multiscale lesion-focused VQVAE to encode images into discrete latent representations, then trains a Visual AutoRegressive Transformer on tokenized representations. Integrates lesion measurements and types as conditional embeddings to enhance synthesis fidelity.

Result: Achieves best overall FID score (average 0.74) across seven lesion types, improving upon previous state-of-the-art by 6.3%. Enables controllable synthesis of high-fidelity skin images with specific lesion characteristics.

Conclusion: LF-VAR demonstrates effectiveness in generating clinically relevant synthetic skin images with controlled lesion features, addressing limitations of existing methods and providing a valuable tool for medical image synthesis.

Abstract: Skin images from real-world clinical practice are often limited, resulting in
a shortage of training data for deep-learning models. While many studies have
explored skin image synthesis, existing methods often generate low-quality
images and lack control over the lesion's location and type. To address these
limitations, we present LF-VAR, a model leveraging quantified lesion
measurement scores and lesion type labels to guide the clinically relevant and
controllable synthesis of skin images. It enables controlled skin synthesis
with specific lesion characteristics based on language prompts. We train a
multiscale lesion-focused Vector Quantised Variational Auto-Encoder (VQVAE) to
encode images into discrete latent representations for structured tokenization.
Then, a Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) Transformer trained on tokenized
representations facilitates image synthesis. Lesion measurement from the lesion
region and types as conditional embeddings are integrated to enhance synthesis
fidelity. Our method achieves the best overall FID score (average 0.74) among
seven lesion types, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by
6.3%. The study highlights our controllable skin synthesis model's

*Xiaolei Wei,Yi Ouyang,Haibo Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DQRoute is a modular framework for long-tailed visual recognition that combines difficulty-aware optimization with dynamic expert collaboration, improving performance on rare and difficult classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed recognition is challenging due to class imbalance and varying classification difficulty across categories. Simple class frequency reweighting often overlooks intrinsically hard-to-learn classes.

Method: DQRoute estimates class-wise difficulty using prediction uncertainty and historical performance to guide adaptive loss weighting. It employs a mixture-of-experts design where each expert specializes in different class distribution regions. Expert predictions are weighted by confidence scores from expert-specific OOD detectors at inference.

Result: Experiments on standard long-tailed benchmarks show DQRoute significantly improves performance, particularly on rare and difficult classes.

Conclusion: The integration of difficulty modeling with decentralized expert routing provides substantial benefits for long-tailed visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Long-tailed visual recognition is challenging not only due to class imbalance
but also because of varying classification difficulty across categories. Simply
reweighting classes by frequency often overlooks those that are intrinsically
hard to learn. To address this, we propose \textbf{DQRoute}, a modular
framework that combines difficulty-aware optimization with dynamic expert
collaboration. DQRoute first estimates class-wise difficulty based on
prediction uncertainty and historical performance, and uses this signal to
guide training with adaptive loss weighting. On the architectural side, DQRoute
employs a mixture-of-experts design, where each expert specializes in a
different region of the class distribution. At inference time, expert
predictions are weighted by confidence scores derived from expert-specific OOD
detectors, enabling input-adaptive routing without the need for a centralized
router. All components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments
on standard long-tailed benchmarks demonstrate that DQRoute significantly
improves performance, particularly on rare and difficult classes, highlighting
the benefit of integrating difficulty modeling with decentralized expert
routing.

### [96] [Beyond BEV: Optimizing Point-Level Tokens for Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19638)
*Yang Li,Quan Yuan,Guiyang Luo,Xiaoyuan Fu,Rui Pan,Yujia Yang,Congzhang Shao,Yuewen Liu,Jinglin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPLOT introduces point-level tokens for collaborative perception, addressing limitations of BEV representations by preserving 3D structural information through semantic-aware token reordering, frequency-enhanced sequence modeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative perception methods use 2D bird's-eye-view representations that discard critical 3D structural information needed for accurate object recognition and localization. Point-cloud data offers better structural preservation but presents challenges due to its unordered, massive, and position-sensitive nature.

Method: CoPLOT framework with three key components: 1) Semantic-aware token reordering module for adaptive 1D reordering using scene-level and token-level semantic information, 2) Frequency-enhanced state space model to capture long-range dependencies across spatial and spectral domains, 3) Neighbor-to-ego alignment module with global agent-level correction and local token-level refinement to handle localization noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show CoPLOT outperforms state-of-the-art models while achieving lower communication and computation overhead.

Conclusion: Point-level tokens with optimized processing pipeline enable more effective collaborative perception by preserving detailed 3D structural information, demonstrating superior performance with reduced computational costs compared to BEV-based approaches.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows agents to enhance their perceptual
capabilities by exchanging intermediate features. Existing methods typically
organize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV)
representations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues
essential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we
first introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for
collaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered,
massive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and
aligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural
information. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception
framework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a
point-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence
modeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering
module generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and
token-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model
captures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral
domains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background
clutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop
process, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level
refinement to mitigate localization noise. Extensive experiments on both
simulated and real-world datasets show that CoPLOT outperforms state-of-the-art
models, with even lower communication and computation overhead. Code will be
available at https://github.com/CheeryLeeyy/CoPLOT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight unsupervised skeleton-based action localization using spatio-temporal graph neural networks that achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised and weakly supervised methods for fine-grained action localization require extensive annotations and are computationally intensive, making them less practical for real-world scenarios.

Method: Pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on pose-sequence denoising with blockwise partitions, then uses a novel Action Dynamics Metric (ADM) computed from low-dimensional embeddings to detect motion boundaries.

Result: Achieves 82.66% mAP and 29.09 ms average localization latency on DSV Diving dataset, matching supervised state-of-the-art while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The method generalizes robustly to unseen diving footage without retraining, demonstrating practical applicability for lightweight, real-time action analysis in embedded or dynamic environments.

Abstract: Fine-grained action localization in untrimmed sports videos presents a
significant challenge due to rapid and subtle motion transitions over short
durations. Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on
extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them
computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this
work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action
localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural
representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal
Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with
blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without
any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric
(ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects
motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile.
Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average
localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching
state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving
footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for

*Dongjin Kim,Jaekyun Ko,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Tae Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact image denoising method using dynamically generated kernels via efficient operations that prevents overfitting and generalizes well to unseen noise types and levels despite being trained only on single-level Gaussian noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based denoising methods rely on specific noise distributions and suffer from limited generalization to unseen noise types/levels, requiring extensive training data and computational resources while still overfitting.

Method: Utilizes dynamically generated kernels through Feature Extraction Module, Global Statistics and Local Correlation Modules to capture noise characteristics, and Kernel Prediction Module that produces pixel-wise varying kernels adapted to local structures applied iteratively for denoising.

Result: The compact model (~0.04M parameters) excels across diverse noise types and levels despite being trained only on single-level Gaussian noise, demonstrating efficiency and superior restoration quality.

Conclusion: Iterative dynamic filtering shows promise for practical image denoising by preventing overfitting and improving resilience to unseen noise through adaptive kernel generation.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with
applications in photography and medical imaging. While deep learning-based
methods have shown remarkable success, their reliance on specific noise
distributions limits generalization to unseen noise types and levels. Existing
approaches attempt to address this with extensive training data and high
computational resources but they still suffer from overfitting. To address
these issues, we conduct image denoising by utilizing dynamically generated
kernels via efficient operations. This approach helps prevent overfitting and
improves resilience to unseen noise. Specifically, our method leverages a
Feature Extraction Module for robust noise-invariant features, Global
Statistics and Local Correlation Modules to capture comprehensive noise
characteristics and structural correlations. The Kernel Prediction Module then
employs these cues to produce pixel-wise varying kernels adapted to local
structures, which are then applied iteratively for denoising. This ensures both
efficiency and superior restoration quality. Despite being trained on
single-level Gaussian noise, our compact model (~ 0.04 M) excels across diverse
noise types and levels, demonstrating the promise of iterative dynamic
filtering for practical image denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-LevelGauge is a benchmark that systematically evaluates positional bias in large video language models (LVLMs) across different context positions, revealing significant biases in open-source models while commercial models show consistent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video understanding benchmarks assess overall performance but overlook nuanced behaviors like contextual positional bias, which is critical for understanding LVLM limitations and guiding improvements.

Method: Created a benchmark with 438 curated videos, 1,177 multiple-choice and 120 open-ended questions using standardized probes and contextual setups with flexible control over context length, position, and types. Employed statistical measures and morphological pattern recognition for bias analysis.

Result: Evaluation of 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs revealed significant positional biases in many open-source models (typically head or neighbor-content preferences), while commercial models like Gemini2.5-Pro showed consistent performance across entire sequences.

Conclusion: The benchmark effectively exposes positional bias in LVLMs, providing actionable insights for bias mitigation and model enhancement through analyses of context length, variation, and model scale.

Abstract: Large video language models (LVLMs) have made notable progress in video
understanding, spurring the development of corresponding evaluation benchmarks.
However, existing benchmarks generally assess overall performance across entire
video sequences, overlooking nuanced behaviors such as contextual positional
bias, a critical yet under-explored aspect of LVLM performance. We present
Video-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess
positional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized
contextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe
position, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In
addition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines
statistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize
bias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple
types, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended
questions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based
on these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and
open-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many
leading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content
preferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show
impressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences. Further
analyses on context length, context variation, and model scale provide
actionable insights for mitigating bias and guiding model enhancement.

Motivation: AI tasks like object detection in car interiors are crucial for personal assistants but face computational constraints in onboard systems, limiting direct deployment.

Method: Proposes ODAL framework with distributed architecture splitting computational tasks between on-board and cloud systems, leveraging vision foundation models. Introduces ODALbench metric for comprehensive assessment. Compares GPT-4o with lightweight LLaVA 1.5 7B model and explores fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuned ODAL-LLaVA achieves 89% ODAL score (71% improvement over baseline), outperforms GPT-4o by nearly 20%. Maintains high detection accuracy while reducing hallucinations, achieving ODAL_SNR three times higher than GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential to establish new standards in interior scene understanding for automotive applications, overcoming computational constraints through distributed architecture and fine-tuning lightweight models.

Abstract: AI tasks in the car interior like identifying and localizing externally
introduced objects is crucial for response quality of personal assistants.
However, computational resources of on-board systems remain highly constrained,
restricting the deployment of such solutions directly within the vehicle. To
address this limitation, we propose the novel Object Detection and Localization
(ODAL) framework for interior scene understanding. Our approach leverages
vision foundation models through a distributed architecture, splitting
computational tasks between on-board and cloud. This design overcomes the
resource constraints of running foundation models directly in the car. To
benchmark model performance, we introduce ODALbench, a new metric for
comprehensive assessment of detection and localization.Our analysis
demonstrates the framework's potential to establish new standards in this
domain. We compare the state-of-the-art GPT-4o vision foundation model with the
lightweight LLaVA 1.5 7B model and explore how fine-tuning enhances the
lightweight models performance. Remarkably, our fine-tuned ODAL-LLaVA model
achieves an ODAL$_{score}$ of 89%, representing a 71% improvement over its
baseline performance and outperforming GPT-4o by nearly 20%. Furthermore, the
fine-tuned model maintains high detection accuracy while significantly reducing
hallucinations, achieving an ODAL$_{SNR}$ three times higher than GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-SR1 is a self-rewarding reinforcement learning method that improves visual reasoning in VLMs by decomposing reasoning into visual perception and language stages, using the model's own outputs to compute rewards without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from visual hallucinations and language shortcuts due to sparse visual signals and over-reliance on text priors. Existing methods using human annotations or external models are costly and cause distributional shifts.

Method: Decomposes VLM reasoning into visual perception and language reasoning stages. The model generates self-contained visual perceptions, then validates them by re-prompting the same model to perform reasoning using only the generated perception. This self-reward is combined with final output supervision.

Result: Improves visual reasoning, mitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts across diverse vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: Vision-SR1 provides an effective self-supervised approach to enhance visual reasoning in VLMs without external visual supervision, addressing core limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying
things that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they
skip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because
most post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching
and supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without
explicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often
learn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To
mitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human
annotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human
annotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot
adapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to
reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method
that improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions
via reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two
stages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted
to produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the
question without referring back the input image. To validate this
self-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language
reasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This
self-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced
training signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.
Our experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,
mitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts
across diverse vision-language tasks.

*Matthias Höfflin,Jürgen Wassner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNNs show 50-60% energy advantage over CNNs in hardware-agnostic analysis, but significant savings only occur on neuromorphic hardware with high input sparsity. Hardware-aware analysis reveals data characteristics and hardware assumptions critically impact energy efficiency comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) truly provide energy efficiency advantages over conventional ANNs for satellite position estimation, especially given recent studies questioning SNNs' reputation for energy efficiency in digital implementations.

Method: Developed an SNN for 3-D satellite position estimation from monocular images using membrane potential of LIF neurons in final layer. Compared with reference CNN on photorealistic dataset. Used both hardware-aware and hardware-agnostic energy estimation methods, analyzing influence of dark pixel ratio and input sparsity.

Result: SNN achieved comparable MSE to CNN. Hardware-agnostic methods predicted consistent 50-60% energy advantage for SNNs, but hardware-aware analysis showed significant energy savings only on neuromorphic hardware with high input sparsity. Dark pixel ratio significantly influenced energy consumption.

Conclusion: Energy efficiency comparisons between SNNs and ANNs require transparent evaluation methods and explicit disclosure of underlying hardware and data assumptions. Significant energy savings for SNNs are hardware-dependent and require specific conditions like neuromorphic hardware and high input sparsity.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological intelligence, have
long been considered inherently energy-efficient, making them attractive for
resource-constrained domains such as space applications. However, recent
comparative studies with conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have
begun to question this reputation, especially for digital implementations. This
work investigates SNNs for multi-output regression, specifically 3-D satellite
position estimation from monocular images, and compares hardware-aware and
hardware-agnostic energy estimation methods. The proposed SNN, trained using
the membrane potential of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron in the
final layer, achieves comparable Mean Squared Error (MSE) to a reference
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a photorealistic satellite dataset.
Energy analysis shows that while hardware-agnostic methods predict a consistent
50-60% energy advantage for SNNs over CNNs, hardware-aware analysis reveals
that significant energy savings are realized only on neuromorphic hardware and
with high input sparsity. The influence of dark pixel ratio on energy
consumption is quantified, emphasizing the impact of data characteristics and
hardware assumptions. These findings highlight the need for transparent
evaluation methods and explicit disclosure of underlying assumptions to ensure
fair comparisons of neural network energy efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel frequency-aware self-supervised learning method for Ultra-Wide-Field retinal image enhancement that addresses blurring and uneven illumination while preserving pathological details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UWF retinal imaging suffers from quality-degrading factors like blurring and uneven illumination that obscure fine details and mask pathological information. Existing methods fail to address UWF's unique requirements for preserving pathological details.

Method: Frequency-aware self-supervised learning with frequency-decoupled image deblurring and Retinex-guided illumination compensation modules. Includes asymmetric channel integration for combining global/local views and color preservation unit for multi-scale spatial/frequency information.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced visualization quality and improved disease diagnosis performance by restoring fine local details and correcting uneven intensity.

Conclusion: This is the first attempt for UWF image enhancement, offering a robust and clinically valuable tool for improving retinal disease management.

Abstract: Ultra-Wide-Field (UWF) retinal imaging has revolutionized retinal diagnostics
by providing a comprehensive view of the retina. However, it often suffers from
quality-degrading factors such as blurring and uneven illumination, which
obscure fine details and mask pathological information. While numerous retinal
image enhancement methods have been proposed for other fundus imageries, they
often fail to address the unique requirements in UWF, particularly the need to
preserve pathological details. In this paper, we propose a novel
frequency-aware self-supervised learning method for UWF image enhancement. It
incorporates frequency-decoupled image deblurring and Retinex-guided
illumination compensation modules. An asymmetric channel integration operation
is introduced in the former module, so as to combine global and local views by
leveraging high- and low-frequency information, ensuring the preservation of
fine and broader structural details. In addition, a color preservation unit is
proposed in the latter Retinex-based module, to provide multi-scale spatial and
frequency information, enabling accurate illumination estimation and
correction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed work not only
enhances visualization quality but also improves disease diagnosis performance
by restoring and correcting fine local details and uneven intensity. To the
best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt for UWF image
enhancement, offering a robust and clinically valuable tool for improving
retinal disease management.

*Gangjian Zhang,Jian Shu,Nanjie Yao,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAT framework for monocular 3D human reconstruction that integrates multiple geometric priors through a two-process approach with Supervisor Feature Regularization and Online Animation Augmentation to address view inconsistencies and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with geometric ambiguity from single 2D images and limited 3D training data, leading to view inconsistencies like facial distortions when integrating different geometric priors (SMPL model, normal maps).

Method: Two-process framework with Supervisor Feature Regularization (uses multi-view network features as supervision) and Online Animation Augmentation (creates massive training samples via animation network) to unify geometric priors and handle data scarcity.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing high-quality textured 3D avatars from single front-view images.

Conclusion: SAT effectively addresses geometric ambiguity and data scarcity issues in monocular 3D human reconstruction by seamlessly integrating multiple geometric priors and augmenting training data, producing high-quality avatars without view inconsistencies.

Abstract: Monocular texture 3D human reconstruction aims to create a complete 3D
digital avatar from just a single front-view human RGB image. However, the
geometric ambiguity inherent in a single 2D image and the scarcity of 3D human
training data are the main obstacles limiting progress in this field. To
address these issues, current methods employ prior geometric estimation
networks to derive various human geometric forms, such as the SMPL model and
normal maps. However, they struggle to integrate these modalities effectively,
leading to view inconsistencies, such as facial distortions. To this end, we
propose a two-process 3D human reconstruction framework, SAT, which seamlessly
learns various prior geometries in a unified manner and reconstructs
high-quality textured 3D avatars as the final output. To further facilitate
geometry learning, we introduce a Supervisor Feature Regularization module. By
employing a multi-view network with the same structure to provide intermediate
features as training supervision, these varied geometric priors can be better
fused. To tackle data scarcity and further improve reconstruction quality, we
also propose an Online Animation Augmentation module. By building a
one-feed-forward animation network, we augment a massive number of samples from
the original 3D human data online for model training. Extensive experiments on
two benchmarks show the superiority of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*V. S. Usatyuk,D. A. Sapozhnikov,S. I. Egorov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Physics-inspired unsupervised detector using graph theory and statistical physics to distinguish real from synthetic images without labeled training data, achieving 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models create highly realistic synthetic images that undermine media forensics and biometric security, while existing detectors fail on unseen generators or adversarial processing.

Method: Treats synthetic-image detection as community detection on sparse weighted graphs. Uses pretrained CNNs for feature extraction, creates Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graphs, transforms similarities into edge couplings at Nishimori temperature, and analyzes Bethe-Hessian spectrum gaps.

Result: Achieves over 94% accuracy on binary classification tasks (cat vs dog, male vs female) using real photos from FFHQ/CelebA and synthetic counterparts from GANs/diffusion models, without labeled synthetic data or retraining.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, model-agnostic detector that works across different generative architectures through spectral analysis of community structure, with potential extensions to video and multi-class anomaly detection.

Abstract: The rapid advance of deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion
networks now produces images that are virtually indistinguishable from genuine
photographs, undermining media forensics and biometric security. Supervised
detectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial
post-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level
statistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired,
model-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a
community-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are
first extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature
vector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities
are transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature,
producing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum
exhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is
present. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack
such gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male
versus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic
counterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled
synthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves
over 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for
real image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones. Our contributions
are threefold: a novel LDPC graph construction that embeds deep image features,
an analytical link between Nishimori temperature RBIM and the Bethe-Hessian
spectrum providing a Bayes optimal detection criterion; and a practical,
unsupervised synthetic image detector robust to new generative architectures.
Future work will extend the framework to video streams and multi-class anomaly
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting lacks 3D segmentation ability, limiting its applicability in scene understanding tasks that require identifying and isolating specific object components.

Method: Proposes LabelGS which introduces cross-view consistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians, employs Occlusion Analysis Model to avoid overfitting, Main Gaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic prior to 3D, and Gaussian Projection Filter to avoid label conflicts. Uses random region sampling strategy for efficient optimization.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods including Feature-3DGS in 3D scene segmentation, achieving 22x speedup in training at 1440x1080 resolution.

Conclusion: LabelGS effectively adds segmentation capabilities to 3DGS while significantly improving training efficiency, making it suitable for scene understanding applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a novel explicit representation
for 3D scenes, offering both high-fidelity reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, 3DGS lacks 3D segmentation ability, which limits its
applicability in tasks that require scene understanding. The identification and
isolating of specific object components is crucial. To address this limitation,
we propose Label-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (LabelGS), a method that augments
the Gaussian representation with object label.LabelGS introduces cross-view
consistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians and employs a novel Occlusion
Analysis Model to avoid overfitting occlusion during optimization, Main
Gaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic prior to 3D Gaussian and Gaussian
Projection Filter to avoid Gaussian label conflict. Our approach achieves
effective decoupling of Gaussian representations and refines the 3DGS
optimization process through a random region sampling strategy, significantly
improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LabelGS
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including Feature-3DGS, in the
3D scene segmentation task. Notably, LabelGS achieves a remarkable 22X speedup
in training compared to Feature-3DGS, at a resolution of 1440X1080. Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeVPS is a training-free video polyp segmentation method that combines IPS spatial context with SAM2 temporal modeling, using two modules to eliminate error accumulation and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VPS methods struggle to balance spatiotemporal modeling and domain generalization, limiting real clinical applicability. SAM2 suffers from error accumulation during long-term polyp tracking, causing segmentation instability.

Method: Recasts VPS as track-by-detect paradigm using IPS for spatial context and SAM2 for temporal modeling. Introduces two training-free modules: intra-association filtering to eliminate spatial inaccuracies and reduce false positives, and inter-association refinement to adaptively update memory bank and prevent error propagation.

Result: Achieves cutting-edge performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Demonstrates robust tracking capabilities in long-untrimmed colonoscopy videos.

Conclusion: FreeVPS provides a reliable solution for clinical video polyp segmentation by synergistically stabilizing SAM2 through the two modules, showing strong potential for clinical analysis applications.

Abstract: Existing video polyp segmentation (VPS) paradigms usually struggle to balance
between spatiotemporal modeling and domain generalization, limiting their
applicability in real clinical scenarios. To embrace this challenge, we recast
the VPS task as a track-by-detect paradigm that leverages the spatial contexts
captured by the image polyp segmentation (IPS) model while integrating the
temporal modeling capabilities of segment anything model 2 (SAM2). However,
during long-term polyp tracking in colonoscopy videos, SAM2 suffers from error
accumulation, resulting in a snowball effect that compromises segmentation
stability. We mitigate this issue by repurposing SAM2 as a video polyp
segmenter with two training-free modules. In particular, the intra-association
filtering module eliminates spatial inaccuracies originating from the detecting
stage, reducing false positives. The inter-association refinement module
adaptively updates the memory bank to prevent error propagation over time,
enhancing temporal coherence. Both modules work synergistically to stabilize
SAM2, achieving cutting-edge performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust tracking capabilities of
FreeVPS in long-untrimmed colonoscopy videos, underscoring its potential
reliable clinical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models struggle to generalize beyond training distributions, especially for real-world media content, due to increasing realism and accessibility of deepfakes.

Method: Built on FSFM self-supervised face foundation model, fine-tuned with ensemble of deepfake datasets. Uses triplet loss variants for separable embeddings and attribution-based supervision by manipulation type/source dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness in diverse benchmarks, particularly in challenging real-world scenarios with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust deepfake detection with improved generalization through face foundation models, triplet loss, and attribution supervision techniques.

Abstract: The increasing realism and accessibility of deepfakes have raised critical
concerns about media authenticity and information integrity. Despite recent
advances, deepfake detection models often struggle to generalize beyond their
training distributions, particularly when applied to media content found in the
wild. In this work, we present a robust video deepfake detection framework with
strong generalization that takes advantage of the rich facial representations
learned by face foundation models. Our method is built on top of FSFM, a
self-supervised model trained on real face data, and is further fine-tuned
using an ensemble of deepfake datasets spanning both face-swapping and
face-reenactment manipulations. To enhance discriminative power, we incorporate
triplet loss variants during training, guiding the model to produce more
separable embeddings between real and fake samples. Additionally, we explore
attribution-based supervision schemes, where deepfakes are categorized by
manipulation type or source dataset, to assess their impact on generalization.
Extensive experiments across diverse evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially in challenging real-world scenarios.

*Chenguang Liu,Chisheng Wang,Yuhua Cai,Chuanhua Zhu,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POEv2 is a robust line segment detection framework that works for both generic and wireframe detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with efficient edge detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing line segment detectors are specialized for either generic detection (all meaningful segments) or wireframe detection (geometrically meaningful segments with large spatial support), but none work well for both tasks simultaneously.

Method: Improved version of Pixel Orientation Estimation (POE) method that detects line segments from edge strength maps and can be combined with any edge detector.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets when combined with an efficient edge detector.

Conclusion: POEv2 provides a unified framework that effectively handles both generic and wireframe line segment detection tasks, overcoming the limitations of specialized detectors.

Abstract: Line segment detection in images has been studied for several decades.
Existing line segment detectors can be roughly divided into two categories:
generic line segment detectors and wireframe line segment detectors. Generic
line segment detectors aim to detect all meaningful line segments in images and
traditional approaches usually fall into this category. Recent deep learning
based approaches are mostly wireframe line segment detectors. They detect only
line segments that are geometrically meaningful and have large spatial support.
Due to the difference in the aim of design, the performance of generic line
segment detectors for the task of wireframe line segment detection won't be
satisfactory, and vice versa. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
can be used for both generic line segment detection and wireframe line segment
detection. The proposed method is an improved version of the Pixel Orientation
Estimation (POE) method. It is thus named as POEv2. POEv2 detects line segments
from edge strength maps, and can be combined with any edge detector. We show in
our experiments that by combining the proposed POEv2 with an efficient edge
detector, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models neglect prompt information extraction in LF SOD tasks and ignore frequency-domain analysis, causing small objects to be overwhelmed by noise.

Method: Proposes SPLF-SAM with unified multi-scale feature embedding block (UMFEB) to identify multiple objects of varying sizes, and multi-scale adaptive filtering adapter (MAFA) to learn frequency features and prevent small objects from noise interference.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority over ten state-of-the-art LF SOD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SPLF-SAM effectively addresses prompt extraction and frequency-domain challenges in light field salient object detection, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
solving light field salient object detection (LF SOD). However, most existing
models tend to neglect the extraction of prompt information under this task.
Meanwhile, traditional models ignore the analysis of frequency-domain

paper, we put forward a novel model called self-prompting light field segment
anything model (SPLF-SAM), equipped with unified multi-scale feature embedding
block (UMFEB) and a multi-scale adaptive filtering adapter (MAFA). UMFEB is
capable of identifying multiple objects of varying sizes, while MAFA, by
learning frequency features, effectively prevents small objects from being
overwhelmed by noise. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority
of our method over ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) LF SOD methods. Our code will be

Method: Uses a VGGT-style transformer architecture with multi-granular guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) and incremental Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses to predict aggregatable canonical 3DGS representations.

Result: FastAvatar achieves higher quality and highly competitive speed compared to existing methods, enabling incremental reconstruction that improves with more observations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar modeling that efficiently leverages diverse input data without wasting information like prior methods.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D avatar reconstruction, it still faces
challenges such as high time complexity, sensitivity to data quality, and low
data utilization. We propose FastAvatar, a feedforward 3D avatar framework
capable of flexibly leveraging diverse daily recordings (e.g., a single image,
multi-view observations, or monocular video) to reconstruct a high-quality 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model within seconds, using only a single unified
model. FastAvatar's core is a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer
featuring three key designs: First, a variant VGGT-style transformer
architecture aggregating multi-frame cues while injecting initial 3D prompt to
predict an aggregatable canonical 3DGS representation; Second, multi-granular
guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) mitigating
animation-induced misalignment for variable-length inputs; Third, incremental
Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses.
Integrating these features, FastAvatar enables incremental reconstruction,
i.e., improving quality with more observations, unlike prior work wasting input
data. This yields a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar
modeling. Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar has higher quality and
highly competitive speed compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BuzzSet is a new large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator images for automated monitoring, containing 7856 verified images with over 8000 annotated instances across honeybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pollinator populations are declining due to environmental stressors, requiring scalable automated monitoring solutions to support global food production and ecosystem stability.

Method: Created BuzzSet dataset with manually verified images collected in real agricultural fields, using YOLOv12 for initial annotations and human verification. Preprocessed images into 256x256 tiles and used RF-DETR transformer-based object detector for evaluation.

Result: Achieved high F1-scores of 0.94 for honeybees and 0.92 for bumblebees, with minimal misclassification between these categories. Best mAP@0.50 of 0.559, though unidentified class remains challenging due to label ambiguity.

Conclusion: BuzzSet provides a valuable benchmark for small object detection, class separation under label noise, and ecological computer vision applications in pollinator monitoring.

Abstract: Pollinator insects such as honeybees and bumblebees are vital to global food
production and ecosystem stability, yet their populations are declining due to
increasing anthropogenic and environmental stressors. To support scalable,
automated pollinator monitoring, we introduce BuzzSet, a new large-scale
dataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected in real agricultural
field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7856 manually verified and labeled images,
with over 8000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees,
and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were generated using a YOLOv12
model trained on external data and refined via human verification using
open-source labeling tools. All images were preprocessed into 256~$\times$~256
tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide strong baselines
using the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves high
F1-scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybee and bumblebee classes, respectively,
with confusion matrix results showing minimal misclassification between these
categories. The unidentified class remains more challenging due to label
ambiguity and lower sample frequency, yet still contributes useful insights for
robustness evaluation. Overall detection quality is strong, with a best
mAP@0.50 of 0.559. BuzzSet offers a valuable benchmark for small object
detection, class separation under label noise, and ecological computer vision.

*Shu Shen,C. L. Philip Chen,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIM addresses optimization bias in imbalanced multimodal learning by adaptively modulating parameters across network depths, improving both dominant and weak modalities without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for imbalanced multimodal learning hinder dominant modalities to promote weaker ones, affecting overall performance due to overlooked optimization bias within networks.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) that decouples under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks, encourages reliance on degraded blocks for joint training, and adaptively adjusts modulation strength across network depths based on imbalance levels.

Result: AIM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks and shows strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.

Conclusion: AIM successfully addresses optimization bias in multimodal networks, achieving balanced learning without compromising either modality's performance, representing a significant advancement in imbalanced multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance
but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal
learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is
typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we
find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to
promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We
analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem:
optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive
Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM
accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths
within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning
without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time.
Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters
into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded
blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively
prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization
of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally,
AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively
adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate
that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods
across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across
different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.

*Jakob Seitz,Tobias Lengfeld,Radu Timofte*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structural recognition approach for handwritten math expressions that provides explicit symbol-to-trace alignment, enabling better error analysis and interpretability compared to traditional encoder-decoder models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current encoder-decoder architectures with large language models excel at LaTeX generation but lack explicit symbol-to-trace alignment, which is critical for error analysis, interpretability, and spatially aware interactive applications requiring selective content updates.

Method: Two innovations: 1) automatic annotation system using neural network to map LaTeX equations to raw traces for generating symbol segmentation, classification, and spatial relation annotations; 2) modular structural recognition system that independently optimizes segmentation, classification, and relation prediction using graph-based trace sorting, hybrid convolutional-recurrent network, and transformer-based correction.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on the CROHME-2023 benchmark while generating complete graph structures that directly link handwritten traces to predicted symbols.

Conclusion: The structural recognition system enables transparent error analysis and interpretable outputs, addressing critical limitations of existing approaches for educational technology applications.

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition is foundational for
educational technologies, enabling applications like digital note-taking and
automated grading. While modern encoder-decoder architectures with large
language models excel at LaTeX generation, they lack explicit symbol-to-trace
alignment, a critical limitation for error analysis, interpretability, and
spatially aware interactive applications requiring selective content updates.
This paper introduces a structural recognition approach with two innovations: 1
an automatic annotation system that uses a neural network to map LaTeX
equations to raw traces, automatically generating annotations for symbol
segmentation, classification, and spatial relations, and 2 a modular structural
recognition system that independently optimizes segmentation, classification,
and relation prediction. By leveraging a dataset enriched with structural
annotations from our auto-labeling system, the proposed recognition system
combines graph-based trace sorting, a hybrid convolutional-recurrent network,
and transformer-based correction to achieve competitive performance on the
CROHME-2023 benchmark. Crucially, our structural recognition system generates a
complete graph structure that directly links handwritten traces to predicted
symbols, enabling transparent error analysis and interpretable outputs.

### [115] [MAPo : Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19786)
*Han Jiao,Jiakai Sun,Yexing Xu,Lei Zhao,Wei Xing,Huaizhong Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPo introduces motion-aware partitioning of 3D Gaussians to improve dynamic scene reconstruction by separating high/low dynamic regions and using specialized deformation networks with cross-frame consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deformation-based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for dynamic scenes produce blurred renderings and lose fine motion details due to limitations of single unified models in representing diverse motion patterns.

Method: Dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that distinguishes high/low dynamic 3D Gaussians. High-dynamic Gaussians are recursively partitioned temporally with duplicated deformation networks per segment, while low-dynamic ones remain static. Cross-frame consistency loss ensures visual continuity.

Result: Superior rendering quality compared to baselines while maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with complex or rapid motions.

Conclusion: MAPo framework effectively addresses motion blur and detail loss in dynamic scene reconstruction through motion-aware partitioning and specialized modeling of high-dynamic regions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting, known for enabling high-quality static scene
reconstruction with fast rendering, is increasingly being applied to dynamic
scene reconstruction. A common strategy involves learning a deformation field
to model the temporal changes of a canonical set of 3D Gaussians. However,
these deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine
motion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a
single, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these
challenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene
reconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that
distinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D
Gaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their
deformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized
modeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs
are treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal
partitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual
discontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we
introduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual
continuity but also further enhances rendering quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines
while maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with
complex or rapid motions.

*Xiuchao Wu,Pengfei Zhu,Jiangjing Lyu,Xinguo Liu,Jie Guo,Yanwen Guo,Weiwei Xu,Chengfei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableIntrinsic is a one-step diffusion model for multi-view material estimation that produces high-quality, low-variance material parameters, outperforming previous methods with significant improvements in PSNR and MSE metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based material estimation methods use multi-step denoising which is time-consuming and produces high-variance results due to stochastic inference conflicting with deterministic material estimation tasks.

Method: Proposes a one-step diffusion model with pixel-space losses designed based on material properties, and introduces a Detail Injection Network (DIN) to eliminate detail loss from VAE encoding and enhance sharpness.

Result: Achieves 9.9% improvement in PSNR for albedo, and reduces MSE for metallic and roughness by 44.4% and 60.0% respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: StableIntrinsic demonstrates that one-step diffusion with carefully designed losses and detail preservation mechanisms can effectively address the limitations of multi-step approaches for material estimation tasks.

Abstract: Recovering material information from images has been extensively studied in
computer graphics and vision. Recent works in material estimation leverage
diffusion model showing promising results. However, these diffusion-based
methods adopt a multi-step denoising strategy, which is time-consuming for each
estimation. Such stochastic inference also conflicts with the deterministic
material estimation task, leading to a high variance estimated results. In this
paper, we introduce StableIntrinsic, a one-step diffusion model for multi-view
material estimation that can produce high-quality material parameters with low
variance. To address the overly-smoothing problem in one-step diffusion,
StableIntrinsic applies losses in pixel space, with each loss designed based on
the properties of the material. Additionally, StableIntrinsic introduces a
Detail Injection Network (DIN) to eliminate the detail loss caused by VAE
encoding, while further enhancing the sharpness of material prediction results.
The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses the current
state-of-the-art techniques by achieving a $9.9\%$ improvement in the Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of albedo, and by reducing the Mean Square Error
(MSE) for metallic and roughness by $44.4\%$ and $60.0\%$, respectively.

*Shay Shomer Chai,Wenxuan Peng,Bharath Hariharan,Hadar Averbuch-Elor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-image models struggle with multi-object color prompts. This paper introduces a dedicated editing technique that significantly improves multi-color semantic alignment across various diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image generation methods fail to accurately capture precise semantics in complex multi-object prompts, particularly with color attributes. Existing evaluation metrics are coarse and human evaluations are difficult to scale.

Method: The authors perform a case study on color attributes, analyze pretrained models' limitations with multi-color prompts, and introduce a dedicated image editing technique specifically designed to address multi-object semantic alignment issues for prompts containing multiple colors.

Result: The analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle significantly more with multiple color attributes than single-color prompts, and existing inference-time techniques and editing methods fail to reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. The proposed approach demonstrates significant performance improvements across a wide range of metrics.

Conclusion: The dedicated image editing technique effectively mitigates multi-object semantic alignment issues for color-rich prompts and outperforms existing methods, providing a scalable solution for improving text-to-image generation fidelity with complex multi-attribute descriptions.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has recently seen remarkable success, granting users
with the ability to create high-quality images through the use of text.
However, contemporary methods face challenges in capturing the precise
semantics conveyed by complex multi-object prompts. Consequently, many works
have sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via
inference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising
networks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the
cosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations,
which are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a
case study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with
objects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation.
Our analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that
faithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color
prompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods
reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. Accordingly, we introduce a
dedicated image editing technique, mitigating the issue of multi-object
semantic alignment for prompts containing multiple colors. We demonstrate that
our approach significantly boosts performance over a wide range of metrics,
considering images generated by various text-to-image diffusion-based
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating waste sorting of non-biodegradable materials is challenging due to complex and variable waste streams, requiring improved accuracy and efficiency in sorting systems.

Method: Encoder-Decoder architecture enhanced with Comprehensive Attention Block, Mamba attention mechanism, and Data Fusion Block using PCA transformation for multi-channel image fusion (RGB, hyperspectral, multispectral).

Result: The approach significantly outperforms existing methods across all evaluated data types including RGB, hyperspectral, multispectral, and combined RGB-hyperspectral data.

Conclusion: The proposed neural architecture with attention mechanisms and PCA-based data fusion provides a superior solution for automated waste sorting systems, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over current methods.

Abstract: In the realm of waste management, automating the sorting process for
non-biodegradable materials presents considerable challenges due to the
complexity and variability of waste streams. To address these challenges, we
introduce an enhanced neural architecture that builds upon an existing
Encoder-Decoder structure to improve the accuracy and efficiency of waste
sorting systems. Our model integrates several key innovations: a Comprehensive
Attention Block within the decoder, which refines feature representations by
combining convolutional and upsampling operations. In parallel, we utilize
attention through the Mamba architecture, providing an additional performance
boost. We also introduce a Data Fusion Block that fuses images with more than
three channels. To achieve this, we apply PCA transformation to reduce the
dimensionality while retaining the maximum variance and essential information
across three dimensions, which are then used for further processing. We
evaluated the model on RGB, hyperspectral, multispectral, and a combination of
RGB and hyperspectral data. The results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitotic figure detection faces challenges from scanner variability, staining differences, tissue types, and artifacts, requiring robust solutions for clinical deployment.

Method: Uses RTMDet single stage object detector with multi-domain training data, balanced sampling, careful augmentation, and hard negative mining on necrotic/debris tissue to reduce false positives.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical speed-accuracy trade-off suitable for real-world clinical adoption, demonstrating robustness across diverse domains with efficient inference.

Abstract: Mitotic figure (MF) detection in histopathology images is challenging due to
large variations in slide scanners, staining protocols, tissue types, and the
presence of artifacts. This paper presents a collection of training techniques
- a bag of tricks - that enable robust, real-time MF detection across diverse
domains. We build on the efficient RTMDet single stage object detector to
achieve high inference speed suitable for clinical deployment. Our method
addresses scanner variability and tumor heterogeneity via extensive
multi-domain training data, balanced sampling, and careful augmentation.
Additionally, we employ targeted, hard negative mining on necrotic and debris
tissue to reduce false positives. In a grouped 5-fold cross-validation across
multiple MF datasets, our model achieves an F1 score between 0.78 and 0.84. On
the preliminary test set of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025
challenge, our single-stage RTMDet-S based approach reaches an F1 of 0.81,
outperforming larger models and demonstrating adaptability to new, unfamiliar
domains. The proposed solution offers a practical trade-off between accuracy
and speed, making it attractive for real-world clinical adoption.

TL;DR: CSSL framework uses context-aware thresholding to dynamically regulate neuron activations for sparse event processing, achieving high performance with extreme sparsity in event-based vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods don't fully leverage event data sparsity, and neuromorphic computing struggles to match state-of-the-art performance in complex tasks while maintaining sparsity.

Method: Proposes Context-aware Sparse Spatiotemporal Learning (CSSL) with context-aware thresholding that dynamically regulates neuron activations based on input distribution without explicit sparsity constraints.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in event-based object detection and optical flow estimation while maintaining extremely high neuronal sparsity.

Conclusion: CSSL enables efficient event-based vision for neuromorphic processing by naturally reducing activation density without manual sparsity tuning.

Abstract: Event-based camera has emerged as a promising paradigm for robot perception,
offering advantages with high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and
robustness to motion blur. However, existing deep learning-based event
processing methods often fail to fully leverage the sparse nature of event
data, complicating their integration into resource-constrained edge
applications. While neuromorphic computing provides an energy-efficient
alternative, spiking neural networks struggle to match of performance of
state-of-the-art models in complex event-based vision tasks, like object
detection and optical flow. Moreover, achieving high activation sparsity in
neural networks is still difficult and often demands careful manual tuning of
sparsity-inducing loss terms. Here, we propose Context-aware Sparse
Spatiotemporal Learning (CSSL), a novel framework that introduces context-aware
thresholding to dynamically regulate neuron activations based on the input
distribution, naturally reducing activation density without explicit sparsity
constraints. Applied to event-based object detection and optical flow
estimation, CSSL achieves comparable or superior performance to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining extremely high neuronal sparsity.
Our experimental results highlight CSSL's crucial role in enabling efficient
event-based vision for neuromorphic processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Instance Segmentation requires pixel-level masks and temporal consistency labels, which are challenging to annotate. Existing unsupervised methods suffer from synthetic-to-real domain gap limitations.

Method: Quality-guided self-training with a closed-loop system between pseudo-label generation and automatic quality assessment, enabling progressive adaptation from synthetic to real videos.

Result: Achieves 52.6 AP50 on YouTubeVIS-2019 val set, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VideoCutLER by 4.4% without human annotations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of quality-aware self-training for unsupervised VIS, effectively bridging the synthetic-to-real domain gap.

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) faces significant annotation challenges due
to its dual requirements of pixel-level masks and temporal consistency labels.
While recent unsupervised methods like VideoCutLER eliminate optical flow
dependencies through synthetic data, they remain constrained by the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. We present AutoQ-VIS, a novel unsupervised
framework that bridges this gap through quality-guided self-training. Our
approach establishes a closed-loop system between pseudo-label generation and
automatic quality assessment, enabling progressive adaptation from synthetic to
real videos. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 52.6
$\text{AP}_{50}$ on YouTubeVIS-2019 val set, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art VideoCutLER by 4.4$\%$, while requiring no human annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed ERSR framework for semi-supervised fetal head ultrasound segmentation using dual-scoring filtering, ellipse-constrained refinement, and symmetry-based consistency regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated fetal head segmentation in ultrasound is critical for prenatal monitoring but challenging due to poor image quality and lack of annotated data. Existing semi-supervised methods struggle with ultrasound-specific characteristics.

Method: ERSR framework with three components: 1) Dual-scoring adaptive filtering using boundary consistency and contour regularity, 2) Ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement via least-squares ellipse fitting, 3) Symmetry-based multiple consistency regularization across perturbed images and symmetric regions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: HC18 dataset - 92.05% Dice with 10% labeled data, 95.36% with 20% labeled data; PSFH dataset - 91.68% with 10% labeled, 93.70% with 20% labeled.

Conclusion: The proposed ERSR framework effectively addresses challenges in fetal head ultrasound segmentation by generating reliable pseudo-labels and enforcing robust consistency constraints, achieving superior performance with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the fetal head in ultrasound images is critical for
prenatal monitoring. However, achieving robust segmentation remains challenging
due to the poor quality of ultrasound images and the lack of annotated data.
Semi-supervised methods alleviate the lack of annotated data but struggle with
the unique characteristics of fetal head ultrasound images, making it
challenging to generate reliable pseudo-labels and enforce effective
consistency regularization constraints. To address this issue, we propose a
novel semi-supervised framework, ERSR, for fetal head ultrasound segmentation.
Our framework consists of the dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy, the
ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and the symmetry-based multiple
consistency regularization. The dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy uses
boundary consistency and contour regularity criteria to evaluate and filter
teacher outputs. The ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement refines these
filtered outputs by fitting least-squares ellipses, which strengthens pixels
near the center of the fitted ellipse and suppresses noise simultaneously. The
symmetry-based multiple consistency regularization enforces multi-level
consistency across perturbed images, symmetric regions, and between original
predictions and pseudo-labels, enabling the model to capture robust and stable
shape representations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
benchmarks. On the HC18 dataset, it reaches Dice scores of 92.05% and 95.36%
with 10% and 20% labeled data, respectively. On the PSFH dataset, the scores
are 91.68% and 93.70% under the same settings.

*Yilin Zhang,Cai Xu,You Wu,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel calibration framework that improves model reliability under distribution shift without requiring target domain information, using low-frequency filtering and gradient-based rectification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks produce overconfident predictions that become worse under distribution shift, and existing methods require impractical access to target domain information.

Method: Uses low-frequency filtering to encourage reliance on domain-invariant features, plus gradient-based rectification to maintain in-distribution calibration as a hard constraint.

Result: Significantly improves calibration under distribution shift on CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS datasets while maintaining strong in-distribution performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses miscalibration under distribution shift without target domain access, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often produce overconfident predictions, undermining
their reliability in safety-critical applications. This miscalibration is
further exacerbated under distribution shift, where test data deviates from the
training distribution due to environmental or acquisition changes. While
existing approaches improve calibration through training-time regularization or
post-hoc adjustment, their reliance on access to or simulation of target
domains limits their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
propose a novel calibration framework that operates without access to target
domain information. From a frequency-domain perspective, we identify that
distribution shifts often distort high-frequency visual cues exploited by deep
models, and introduce a low-frequency filtering strategy to encourage reliance
on domain-invariant features. However, such information loss may degrade
In-Distribution (ID) calibration performance. Therefore, we further propose a
gradient-based rectification mechanism that enforces ID calibration as a hard
constraint during optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world shifted
datasets, including CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS, demonstrate that our method
significantly improves calibration under distribution shift while maintaining
strong in-distribution performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes machine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework to evaluate how image degradations affect machine vision systems, including a large database and region-aware model that outperforms human vision-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine vision systems are vulnerable to performance degradation under adverse visual conditions, and human visual system-based quality metrics are inadequate for predicting machine vision performance.

Method: Established MIQA paradigm with end-to-end workflow, constructed MIQD-2.5M database (2.5M samples across 75 models, 250 degradation types, 3 vision tasks), and proposed region-aware RA-MIQA model for fine-grained spatial degradation analysis.

Result: RA-MIQA achieved superior performance with SRCC gains of 13.56% on consistency and 13.37% on accuracy for image classification, outperforming HVS-based metrics and retrained classical backbones. Revealed task-specific degradation sensitivities.

Conclusion: HVS-based metrics are inadequate for MVS quality prediction. The study advances MVS reliability and establishes foundations for machine-centric image processing and optimization. The framework addresses limitations of existing approaches with background degradations, accuracy estimation, and subtle distortions.

Abstract: Machine vision systems (MVS) are intrinsically vulnerable to performance
degradation under adverse visual conditions. To address this, we propose a
machine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework that quantifies the
impact of image degradations on MVS performance. We establish an MIQA paradigm
encompassing the end-to-end assessment workflow. To support this, we construct
a machine-centric image quality database (MIQD-2.5M), comprising 2.5 million
samples that capture distinctive degradation responses in both consistency and
accuracy metrics, spanning 75 vision models, 250 degradation types, and three
representative vision tasks. We further propose a region-aware MIQA (RA-MIQA)
model to evaluate MVS visual quality through fine-grained spatial degradation
analysis. Extensive experiments benchmark the proposed RA-MIQA against seven
human visual system (HVS)-based IQA metrics and five retrained classical
backbones. Results demonstrate RA-MIQA's superior performance in multiple
dimensions, e.g., achieving SRCC gains of 13.56% on consistency and 13.37% on
accuracy for image classification, while also revealing task-specific
degradation sensitivities. Critically, HVS-based metrics prove inadequate for
MVS quality prediction, while even specialized MIQA models struggle with
background degradations, accuracy-oriented estimation, and subtle distortions.

### [125] [Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852)
*Binjie Zhang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified two-stage framework that jointly predicts next actions and their visual outcomes in egocentric scenarios using hand trajectories and multi-modal fusion with latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either predict actions without visual consequences (VLA models) or generate future frames without action conditioning (video prediction models), leading to incomplete or implausible results in human-object interaction understanding.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Consecutive state modeling processes visual observations, language, and action history to predict future hand trajectories; 2) Causal cross-attention fuses multi-modal cues to guide a Latent Diffusion Model for frame-by-frame video generation conditioned on inferred actions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench datasets in both action prediction accuracy and future video synthesis quality.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully bridges the gap between action prediction and visual outcome modeling, enabling comprehensive understanding of human-object interactions and supporting robotic manipulation tasks with explicit predictions of both actions and their visual consequences.

Abstract: In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual
outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for
enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly
modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action
prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual
scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without
conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or
contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in
egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we
perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual
observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand
trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse
multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based
Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our
approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human
activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit
predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive
experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future
video synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized prediction of aortic aneurysm progression is challenging due to the need to model both subtle local deformations and global anatomical changes within complex 3D geometries for timely intervention.

Method: Dual-branch architecture with local KNN-based convolutional network (KCN) for fine-grained details and global graph convolutional network (GCN) for structural context, plus condition branch for clinical attributes and time intervals.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in geometric accuracy and clinically important diameter estimation on TAAMesh dataset (590 multimodal records from 208 patients).

Conclusion: Provides a robust step toward clinically deployable, personalized 3D disease trajectory modeling with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Personalized, accurate prediction of aortic aneurysm progression is essential
for timely intervention but remains challenging due to the need to model both
subtle local deformations and global anatomical changes within complex 3D
geometries. We propose MCMeshGAN, the first multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh
generative adversarial network for 3D aneurysm growth prediction. MCMeshGAN
introduces a dual-branch architecture combining a novel local KNN-based
convolutional network (KCN) to preserve fine-grained geometric details and a
global graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture long-range structural
context, overcoming the over-smoothing limitations of deep GCNs. A dedicated
condition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and the target time
interval to generate anatomically plausible, temporally controlled predictions,
enabling retrospective and prospective modeling. We curated TAAMesh, a new
longitudinal thoracic aortic aneurysm mesh dataset consisting of 590 multimodal
records (CT scans, 3D meshes, and clinical data) from 208 patients. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MCMeshGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both geometric accuracy and clinically important
diameter estimation. This framework offers a robust step toward clinically
deployable, personalized 3D disease trajectory modeling. The source code for
MCMeshGAN and the baseline methods is publicly available at

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning approach that builds structured visual representations using semantic grouping, instance separation, and hierarchical structuring with a ProtoScale module, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods excel at global image understanding but lack structured scene representation capabilities needed for dense prediction tasks like object detection.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised approach with ProtoScale module that combines semantic grouping, instance level separation, and hierarchical structuring while preserving full scene context across augmented views.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object detection tasks on COCO and UA-DETRAC datasets, even with limited annotated data and fewer fine-tuning epochs.

Conclusion: The method successfully learns object-centric representations that enhance supervised object detection performance, demonstrating the value of structured visual representation learning in SSL.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful technique for
learning visual representations. While recent SSL approaches achieve strong
results in global image understanding, they are limited in capturing the
structured representation in scenes. In this work, we propose a self-supervised
approach that progressively builds structured visual representations by
combining semantic grouping, instance level separation, and hierarchical
structuring. Our approach, based on a novel ProtoScale module, captures visual
elements across multiple spatial scales. Unlike common strategies like DINO
that rely on random cropping and global embeddings, we preserve full scene
context across augmented views to improve performance in dense prediction
tasks. We validate our method on downstream object detection tasks using a
combined subset of multiple datasets (COCO and UA-DETRAC). Experimental results
show that our method learns object centric representations that enhance
supervised object detection and outperform the state-of-the-art methods, even
when trained with limited annotated data and fewer fine-tuning epochs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajFusionNet is a transformer-based model that predicts pedestrian crossing intention by combining future trajectory and vehicle speed predictions, achieving state-of-the-art results with low inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With autonomous vehicles on public roads, accurately predicting pedestrian crossing intention is crucial for safety and navigation. Current approaches need improvement in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes TrajFusionNet with two branches: Sequence Attention Module (SAM) for sequential trajectory/speed learning and Visual Attention Module (VAM) for visual representation of predicted trajectories overlaid on scene images.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets and has the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current approaches.

Conclusion: TrajFusionNet effectively combines trajectory and speed predictions with visual scene context to provide accurate and efficient pedestrian crossing intention prediction for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: With the introduction of vehicles with autonomous capabilities on public
roads, predicting pedestrian crossing intention has emerged as an active area
of research. The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves
determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or
not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model
that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as
priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches:
a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM
branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted
pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch
enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian
trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images.
By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves
the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data
preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of
performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most
commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMI: Sky background estimation model using mutual information and incremental training to improve sky subtraction in fiber spectra by capturing both common sky components and individual local variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sky background subtraction methods rely on average sky fiber spectra, which lack modeling of the environment surrounding objects, leading to inadequate sky subtraction.

Method: Two-network approach: 1) wavelength calibration module extracts sky features and solves feature shift problems, 2) incremental training maximizes mutual information between spectra for common components and minimizes mutual information for individual components to obtain location-specific sky backgrounds.

Result: Experiments on LAMOST spectra show SMI achieves better object sky background estimation, particularly improving performance in the blue end of the spectrum.

Conclusion: SMI effectively addresses limitations of traditional sky subtraction by leveraging mutual information and incremental training to capture both global sky features and local environmental variations.

Abstract: Sky background subtraction is a critical step in Multi-objective Fiber
spectra process. However, current subtraction relies mainly on sky fiber
spectra to build Super Sky. These average spectra are lacking in the modeling
of the environment surrounding the objects. To address this issue, a sky
background estimation model: Sky background building based on Mutual
Information (SMI) is proposed. SMI based on mutual information and incremental
training approach. It utilizes spectra from all fibers in the plate to estimate
the sky background. SMI contains two main networks, the first network applies a
wavelength calibration module to extract sky features from spectra, and can
effectively solve the feature shift problem according to the corresponding
emission position. The second network employs an incremental training approach
to maximize mutual information between representations of different spectra to
capturing the common component. Then, it minimizes the mutual information
between adjoining spectra representations to obtain individual components. This
network yields an individual sky background at each location of the object. To
verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, we conducted experiments
on the spectra of LAMOST. Results show that SMI can obtain a better object sky
background during the observation, especially in the blue end.

Conclusion: KRETA bridges the Korean language gap in text-rich VQA benchmarks and provides an adaptable pipeline that can facilitate similar benchmark development for other languages, accelerating multilingual VLM research.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over text within visual contexts poses a
significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), given the complexity
and diversity of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, text-rich
Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have emerged for
high-resource languages like English. However, a critical gap persists for
low-resource languages such as Korean, where the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks hinders robust model evaluation and comparison. To bridge this gap,

VQA Attuned to diverse visual contexts. KRETA facilitates an in-depth
evaluation of both visual text understanding and reasoning capabilities, while
also supporting a multifaceted assessment across 15 domains and 26 image types.
Additionally, we introduce a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline
specifically optimized for text-rich settings, leveraging refined stepwise

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning models for urban tree extraction using multispectral LiDAR data, finding that Superpoint Transformer with pNDVI integration achieves the best accuracy (85.28% mIoU) and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring urban trees is crucial for greening policies and infrastructure safety, but complex urban environments pose challenges. Multispectral LiDAR offers both spatial and spectral data to improve tree mapping.

Method: The study compares three deep learning models (Superpoint Transformer, Point Transformer V3, and Point Transformer V1) for tree point extraction using MS-LiDAR data, testing spatial data alone versus combined with pseudo NDVI.

Result: SPT showed the best time efficiency and accuracy (85.28% mIoU). Adding pNDVI to spatial data reduced error rate by 10.61 percentage points compared to using spatial information alone.

Conclusion: MS-LiDAR combined with deep learning, particularly SPT with pNDVI integration, significantly improves urban tree extraction accuracy and has strong potential for enhancing tree inventory systems.

Abstract: Monitoring urban tree dynamics is vital for supporting greening policies and
reducing risks to electrical infrastructure. Airborne laser scanning has
advanced large-scale tree management, but challenges remain due to complex
urban environments and tree variability. Multispectral (MS) light detection and
ranging (LiDAR) improves this by capturing both 3D spatial and spectral data,
enabling detailed mapping. This study explores tree point extraction using
MS-LiDAR and deep learning (DL) models. Three state-of-the-art models are
evaluated: Superpoint Transformer (SPT), Point Transformer V3 (PTv3), and Point
Transformer V1 (PTv1). Results show the notable time efficiency and accuracy of
SPT, with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 85.28%. The highest
detection accuracy is achieved by incorporating pseudo normalized difference
vegetation index (pNDVI) with spatial data, reducing error rate by 10.61
percentage points (pp) compared to using spatial information alone. These
findings highlight the potential of MS-LiDAR and DL to improve tree extraction
and further tree inventories.

TL;DR: PersonaAnimator: A novel framework for video-to-video motion personalization that learns personalized motion patterns from unconstrained videos, addressing limitations in existing motion transfer methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have three key limitations: (1) pose-guided methods only replicate motion without learning style characteristics, (2) style transfer relies heavily on difficult-to-obtain motion capture data, and (3) generated motions sometimes violate physical laws.

Method: Proposes PersonaAnimator framework that learns personalized motion patterns directly from unconstrained videos. Introduces PersonaVid dataset with 20 motion content and 120 style categories. Includes Physics-aware Motion Style Regularization for physical plausibility.

Result: Extensive experiments show PersonaAnimator outperforms state-of-the-art motion transfer methods.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for Video-to-Video Motion Personalization task, enabling personalized motion transfer without relying on motion capture data.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion generation show remarkable progress. However,
several limitations remain: (1) Existing pose-guided character motion transfer
methods merely replicate motion without learning its style characteristics,
resulting in inexpressive characters. (2) Motion style transfer methods rely
heavily on motion capture data, which is difficult to obtain. (3) Generated
motions sometimes violate physical laws. To address these challenges, this
paper pioneers a new task: Video-to-Video Motion Personalization. We propose a
novel framework, PersonaAnimator, which learns personalized motion patterns
directly from unconstrained videos. This enables personalized motion transfer.
To support this task, we introduce PersonaVid, the first video-based
personalized motion dataset. It contains 20 motion content categories and 120
motion style categories. We further propose a Physics-aware Motion Style
Regularization mechanism to enforce physical plausibility in the generated
motions. Extensive experiments show that PersonaAnimator outperforms
state-of-the-art motion transfer methods and sets a new benchmark for the
Video-to-Video Motion Personalization task.

Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging offers transformative sensing for ADAS/autonomous driving by enabling material-level scene understanding beyond RGB capabilities, but its practical implementation needs assessment.

Method: Qualitative review of HSI technologies plus quantitative analysis of 216 commercial HSI/multispectral cameras benchmarked against automotive criteria (frame rate, spatial resolution, spectral dimensionality, AEC-Q100 compliance). Also reviewed recent HSI datasets and applications.

Result: Only 4 cameras meet performance thresholds, none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. Current HSI datasets are limited in scale, spectral consistency, channel count, and environmental diversity, posing challenges for algorithm development and validation.

Conclusion: Establishes current state of HSI in automotive contexts as of 2025 and outlines key research directions needed for practical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS/autonomous systems.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a transformative sensing modality for
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD)
applications, enabling material-level scene understanding through fine spectral
resolution beyond the capabilities of traditional RGB imaging. This paper
presents the first comprehensive review of HSI for automotive applications,
examining the strengths, limitations, and suitability of current HSI
technologies in the context of ADAS/AD. In addition to this qualitative review,
we analyze 216 commercially available HSI and multispectral imaging cameras,
benchmarking them against key automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial
resolution, spectral dimensionality, and compliance with AEC-Q100 temperature
standards. Our analysis reveals a significant gap between HSI's demonstrated
research potential and its commercial readiness. Only four cameras meet the
defined performance thresholds, and none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. In
addition, the paper reviews recent HSI datasets and applications, including
semantic segmentation for road surface classification, pedestrian separability,

ADAS/AD applications. This review paper establishes the current state of HSI in
automotive contexts as of 2025 and outlines key research directions toward
practical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS and autonomous systems.

TL;DR: OSS metric enables efficient AL method evaluation without detector training by measuring object-level similarity between training sets and target domains, addressing computational costs and reliability issues in autonomous driving object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning for object detection faces high computational costs (up to 282 GPU hours per detector) and unreliable method rankings across validation sets, limiting practical deployment in safety-critical autonomous driving systems.

Method: Proposes object-based set similarity (OSS) metric that quantifies AL method effectiveness without requiring detector training by measuring similarity between training sets and target domains using object-level features. Also enables selection of representative validation sets.

Result: Validated on three autonomous driving datasets (KITTI, BDD100K, CODA) using uncertainty-based AL methods with two detector architectures (EfficientDet, YOLOv3). OSS is detector-agnostic, requires only labeled object crops, and integrates with existing AL pipelines.

Conclusion: OSS provides a practical framework for deploying AL in real-world applications by unifying AL training and evaluation strategies based on object similarity, addressing computational efficiency and evaluation reliability challenges.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) for real-world object detection faces computational and
reliability challenges that limit practical deployment. Developing new AL
methods requires training multiple detectors across iterations to compare
against existing approaches. This creates high costs for autonomous driving
datasets where the training of one detector requires up to 282 GPU hours.
Additionally, AL method rankings vary substantially across validation sets,
compromising reliability in safety-critical transportation systems. We
introduce object-based set similarity ($\mathrm{OSS}$), a metric that addresses
these challenges. $\mathrm{OSS}$ (1) quantifies AL method effectiveness without
requiring detector training by measuring similarity between training sets and
target domains using object-level features. This enables the elimination of
ineffective AL methods before training. Furthermore, $\mathrm{OSS}$ (2) enables
the selection of representative validation sets for robust evaluation. We
validate our similarity-based approach on three autonomous driving datasets
(KITTI, BDD100K, CODA) using uncertainty-based AL methods as a case study with
two detector architectures (EfficientDet, YOLOv3). This work is the first to
unify AL training and evaluation strategies in object detection based on object
similarity. $\mathrm{OSS}$ is detector-agnostic, requires only labeled object
crops, and integrates with existing AL pipelines. This provides a practical
framework for deploying AL in real-world applications where computational
efficiency and evaluation reliability are critical. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D semantic segmentation method that leverages 2D foundation models to augment sparse 3D annotations by propagating 2D segmentation masks into 3D space and using consistency regularization to generate reliable pseudo labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation methods don't leverage complementary 2D-3D data relationships and fail to fully utilize available labels or address label noise, while 2D foundation models offer powerful segmentation capabilities that could benefit 3D tasks.

Method: Propagates 2D segmentation masks from foundation models into 3D space using geometric correspondences, extends sparse 3D annotations using 3D masks, applies confidence- and uncertainty-based consistency regularization on 3D point cloud augmentations, and selects reliable pseudo labels to generate more training data.

Result: The approach substantially augments available labels and bridges the gap between limited 3D annotations and powerful 2D foundation models.

Conclusion: This innovative strategy improves 3D weakly supervised segmentation performance by maximizing utility of sparse 3D annotations through integration with 2D foundation model capabilities.

Abstract: Current methods for 3D semantic segmentation propose training models with
limited annotations to address the difficulty of annotating large, irregular,
and unordered 3D point cloud data. They usually focus on the 3D domain only,
without leveraging the complementary nature of 2D and 3D data. Besides, some
methods extend original labels or generate pseudo labels to guide the training,
but they often fail to fully use these labels or address the noise within them.
Meanwhile, the emergence of comprehensive and adaptable foundation models has
offered effective solutions for segmenting 2D data. Leveraging this
advancement, we present a novel approach that maximizes the utility of sparsely
available 3D annotations by incorporating segmentation masks generated by 2D
foundation models. We further propagate the 2D segmentation masks into the 3D
space by establishing geometric correspondences between 3D scenes and 2D views.
We extend the highly sparse annotations to encompass the areas delineated by 3D
masks, thereby substantially augmenting the pool of available labels.
Furthermore, we apply confidence- and uncertainty-based consistency
regularization on augmentations of the 3D point cloud and select the reliable
pseudo labels, which are further spread on the 3D masks to generate more
labels. This innovative strategy bridges the gap between limited 3D annotations
and the powerful capabilities of 2D foundation models, ultimately improving the
performance of 3D weakly supervised segmentation.

TL;DR: WaveHiT-SR is a hierarchical transformer framework that embeds wavelet transforms for image super-resolution, using adaptive hierarchical windows and multi-frequency decomposition to capture long-range dependencies while reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based SR methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity in window self-attention, forcing small fixed windows that limit receptive field and long-range dependency modeling.

Method: Embed wavelet transform within hierarchical transformer framework with adaptive hierarchical windows; decompose images into multiple frequency subbands; progressively reconstruct high-resolution images through hierarchical processing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art SR results with higher efficiency - fewer parameters, lower FLOPs, and faster speeds compared to SwinIR-Light, SwinIR-NG, and SRFormer-Light.

Conclusion: WaveHiT-SR effectively addresses computational complexity limitations while improving performance through hierarchical processing and wavelet-based frequency decomposition for both global and local feature capture.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated promising performance in computer vision
tasks, including image super-resolution (SR). The quadratic computational
complexity of window self-attention mechanisms in many transformer-based SR
methods forces the use of small, fixed windows, limiting the receptive field.
In this paper, we propose a new approach by embedding the wavelet transform
within a hierarchical transformer framework, called (WaveHiT-SR). First, using
adaptive hierarchical windows instead of static small windows allows to capture
features across different levels and greatly improve the ability to model
long-range dependencies. Secondly, the proposed model utilizes wavelet
transforms to decompose images into multiple frequency subbands, allowing the
network to focus on both global and local features while preserving structural
details. By progressively reconstructing high-resolution images through
hierarchical processing, the network reduces computational complexity without
sacrificing performance. The multi-level decomposition strategy enables the
network to capture fine-grained information in lowfrequency components while
enhancing high-frequency textures. Through extensive experimentation, we
confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our WaveHiT-SR. Our refined
versions of SwinIR-Light, SwinIR-NG, and SRFormer-Light deliver cutting-edge SR
results, achieving higher efficiency with fewer parameters, lower FLOPs, and
faster speeds.

*Oliver Grainge,Sania Waheed,Jack Stilgoe,Michael Milford,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive assessment of 25 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models' geolocation capabilities reveals concerning privacy risks, with VLMs achieving 61% accuracy on social media-style images despite poor performance on generic street-level images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy concerns as Vision-Language Models demonstrate accurate image geo-location capabilities, with potential risks for stalking and surveillance given widespread AI model usage and social media photo sharing.

Method: Conducted comprehensive assessment of 25 state-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets captured in diverse environments to evaluate geolocation precision, limits, and unintended inference potential.

Result: Current VLMs perform poorly on generic street-level images but achieve notably high accuracy (61%) on images resembling social media content, raising significant privacy concerns.

Conclusion: The study highlights urgent privacy risks from VLMs' geolocation capabilities, particularly for social media images, and calls for attention to the societal implications of these AI capabilities.

Abstract: Geo-localization is the task of identifying the location of an image using
visual cues alone. It has beneficial applications, such as improving disaster
response, enhancing navigation, and geography education. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly demonstrating capabilities as
accurate image geo-locators. This brings significant privacy risks, including
those related to stalking and surveillance, considering the widespread uses of
AI models and sharing of photos on social media. The precision of these models
is likely to improve in the future. Despite these risks, there is little work
on systematically evaluating the geolocation precision of Generative VLMs,
their limits and potential for unintended inferences. To bridge this gap, we
conduct a comprehensive assessment of the geolocation capabilities of 25
state-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets captured in diverse
environments. Our results offer insight into the internal reasoning of VLMs and
highlight their strengths, limitations, and potential societal risks. Our
findings indicate that current VLMs perform poorly on generic street-level
images yet achieve notably high accuracy (61\%) on images resembling social
media content, raising significant and urgent privacy concerns.

### [140] [GS: Generative Segmentation via Label Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20020)
*Yuhao Chen,Shubin Chen,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS (Generative Segmentation) formulates image segmentation as a generative task using label diffusion, directly generating segmentation masks from noise conditioned on both image and language input, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Panoptic Narrative Grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discriminative segmentation methods treat segmentation as pixel classification, while existing diffusion approaches remain image-centric. The authors propose to make segmentation itself the primary generative task rather than an auxiliary process.

Method: GS reverses the typical generative process - instead of generating images from label maps, it directly generates segmentation masks from noise conditioned on both input image and language description using label diffusion.

Result: GS significantly outperforms existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods on Panoptic Narrative Grounding benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.

Conclusion: Formulating segmentation as a generative task via label diffusion provides explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity, enabling end-to-end training and superior performance compared to traditional discriminative approaches.

Abstract: Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language
understanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to
natural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a
discriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based
on semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this
domain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image
diffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation
data via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform
diffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion
models-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we
propose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates
segmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of
generating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the
generative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise,
conditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description.
This paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling
end-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic
Narrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for
multimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by
narrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms
existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.

### [141] [Segmentation Assisted Incremental Test Time Adaptation in an Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20029)
*Manogna Sreenivas,Soma Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called SegAssist for Vision Language Models to adapt to both unseen classes and domains during testing through active labeling and segmentation-assisted sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of unfamiliar objects and distribution shifts in dynamic environments where traditional Test Time Adaptation methods fail to handle both covariate and label shifts simultaneously.

Method: Proposes SegAssist - a training-free segmentation assisted active labeling module that repurposes VLMs' segmentation capabilities to refine active sample selection, prioritizing samples likely from unseen classes by querying an oracle.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate SegAssist's effectiveness in enhancing VLM performance in real-world scenarios requiring continuous adaptation.

Conclusion: SegAssist provides a practical solution for incremental test time adaptation, enabling VLMs to better handle emerging unseen classes and domains during deployment.

Abstract: In dynamic environments, unfamiliar objects and distribution shifts are often
encountered, which challenge the generalization abilities of the deployed
trained models. This work addresses Incremental Test Time Adaptation of Vision
Language Models, tackling scenarios where unseen classes and unseen domains
continuously appear during testing. Unlike traditional Test Time Adaptation
approaches, where the test stream comes only from a predefined set of classes,
our framework allows models to adapt simultaneously to both covariate and label
shifts, actively incorporating new classes as they emerge. Towards this goal,
we establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for
VLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples
potentially representing unseen classes during test time. We propose a
segmentation assisted active labeling module, termed SegAssist, which is
training free and repurposes the segmentation capabilities of VLMs to refine
active sample selection, prioritizing samples likely to belong to unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the
potential of SegAssist to enhance the performance of VLMs in real world
scenarios, where continuous adaptation to emerging data is essential.

*Peng-Hao Hsu,Ke Zhang,Fu-En Wang,Tao Tu,Ming-Feng Li,Yu-Lun Liu,Albert Y. C. Chen,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenM3D is a novel open-vocabulary multi-view indoor 3D object detector trained without human annotations, using 2D-induced voxel features and achieving superior accuracy and speed compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection through image-based methods remains limited compared to 3D point cloud-based methods, creating a need for efficient annotation-free approaches.

Method: Single-stage detector adapting 2D-induced voxel features from ImGeoNet, jointly trained with class-agnostic 3D localization loss and voxel-semantic alignment loss using CLIP features. Uses 3D pseudo box generation with graph embedding to combine 2D segments into coherent 3D structures.

Result: Achieves higher precision and recall than other methods, including OV-3DET. Demonstrates superior accuracy and speed (0.3 sec per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, outperforming strong two-stage methods.

Conclusion: OpenM3D provides an efficient, annotation-free solution for open-vocabulary 3D object detection that combines high-quality pseudo-box generation with CLIP feature alignment for superior performance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary (OV) 3D object detection is an emerging field, yet its
exploration through image-based methods remains limited compared to 3D point
cloud-based methods. We introduce OpenM3D, a novel open-vocabulary multi-view
indoor 3D object detector trained without human annotations. In particular,
OpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features from
the ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic
3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a
voxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features. We
follow the training setting of OV-3DET where posed RGB-D images are given but
no human annotations of 3D boxes or classes are available. We propose a 3D
Pseudo Box Generation method using a graph embedding technique that combines 2D
segments into coherent 3D structures. Our pseudo-boxes achieve higher precision
and recall than other methods, including the method proposed in OV-3DET. We
further sample diverse CLIP features from 2D segments associated with each
coherent 3D structure to align with the corresponding voxel feature. The key to
training a highly accurate single-stage detector requires both losses to be
learned toward high-quality targets. At inference, OpenM3D, a highly efficient
detector, requires only multi-view images for input and demonstrates superior
accuracy and speed (0.3 sec. per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes indoor
benchmarks compared to existing methods. We outperform a strong two-stage
method that leverages our class-agnostic detector with a ViT CLIP-based OV
classifier and a baseline incorporating multi-view depth estimator on both
accuracy and speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Top 10 performance in MARIO challenge for AMD progression tracking using fusion CNN and masked autoencoder approaches for OCT scan analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMD requires timely diagnosis and monitoring for effective anti-VEGF treatment. Tracking neovascular activity progression in OCT scans enables personalized treatment plans.

Method: Task 1: Fusion CNN network with model ensembling for classifying evolution between OCT slice pairs. Task 2: Patch Progression Masked Autoencoder that generates future OCT scans and classifies evolution using Task 1 solution.

Result: Achieved Top 10 ranking in both tasks of the MARIO challenge, though ineligible for prizes due to organizational affiliations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively track AMD progression in OCT scans, demonstrating potential for improved personalized treatment monitoring in clinical practice.

Abstract: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent eye condition affecting
visual acuity. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatments
have been effective in slowing the progression of neovascular AMD, with better
outcomes achieved through timely diagnosis and consistent monitoring. Tracking
the progression of neovascular activity in OCT scans of patients with exudative
AMD allows for the development of more personalized and effective treatment
plans. This was the focus of the Monitoring Age-related Macular Degeneration
Progression in Optical Coherence Tomography (MARIO) challenge, in which we
participated. In Task 1, which involved classifying the evolution between two
pairs of 2D slices from consecutive OCT acquisitions, we employed a fusion CNN
network with model ensembling to further enhance the model's performance. For
Task 2, which focused on predicting progression over the next three months
based on current exam data, we proposed the Patch Progression Masked
Autoencoder that generates an OCT for the next exam and then classifies the
evolution between the current OCT and the one generated using our solution from
Task 1. The results we achieved allowed us to place in the Top 10 for both
tasks. Some team members are part of the same organization as the challenge
organizers; therefore, we are not eligible to compete for the prize.

### [144] [PAUL: Uncertainty-Guided Partition and Augmentation for Robust Cross-View Geo-Localization under Noisy Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20066)
*Zheng Li,Yanming Guo,WenZhe Liu,Xueyi Zhang,Zhaoyun Ding,Long Xu,Mingrui Lao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAUL framework addresses noisy correspondence in cross-view geo-localization by using uncertainty learning to partition and augment training data, achieving superior performance in handling GPS drift and misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods assume perfect image pair alignment during training, but real-world factors like GPS drift and urban canyon effects create systematic alignment shifts with only partial correspondences, which current research largely ignores.

Method: Proposes PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning) - a framework that uses uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential co-training to partition training data based on estimated uncertainty, selectively augmenting high-confidence regions and refining feature learning to suppress noise from misaligned pairs.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show PAUL consistently achieves superior performance over other noisy-correspondence-driven methods across various noise ratios, validating the effectiveness of its individual components.

Conclusion: PAUL successfully bridges the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications in cross-view geo-localization by effectively handling noisy correspondence through uncertainty-based partitioning and augmentation, providing robust supervision for noisy samples.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization is a critical task for UAV navigation, event
detection, and aerial surveying, as it enables matching between drone-captured
and satellite imagery. Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a
joint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these
methods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,
which rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as
urban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather
frequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where
only partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this
source of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current
research. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy
Correspondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to
bridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this
end, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a
novel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated
data uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential
co-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high
correspondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature
learning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from
traditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty
and loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing
robust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves
superior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods
in various noise ratios.

*Zhixuan Liang,Yizhuo Li,Tianshuo Yang,Chengyue Wu,Sitong Mao,Liuao Pei,Xiaokang Yang,Jiangmiao Pang,Yao Mu,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Discrete Diffusion VLA is a unified transformer policy that uses discrete diffusion to model robot actions, achieving adaptive decoding order and robust error correction while maintaining compatibility with vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models either use fixed autoregressive decoding or continuous diffusion heads that require specialized training and iterative sampling, lacking a unified scalable architecture.

Method: Single-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion, trained with cross-entropy objective. Uses adaptive decoding order and secondary remasking for error correction.

Result: Achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal, and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv Bridge, outperforming both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion action decoder enables precise action modeling and consistent training, providing foundation for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to
map images and instructions to robot actions. However, prevailing VLA decoders
either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or
attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone,
demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified,
scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer
policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is
trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design
retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively
compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an
adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones
and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement
rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This
unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel
decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of
function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO,
71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv
Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.
These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise
action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to
larger models and datasets.

*Changha Shin,Woong Oh Cho,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel calibration framework that integrates dual-fisheye camera model into 3D Gaussian splatting to fix imperfect 360-degree panoramas from consumer cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer dual-fisheye systems produce imperfect 360-degree panoramas due to lens separation and angular distortions, limiting quality for VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation applications.

Method: Joint optimization of 3D Gaussian parameters with calibration variables that simulate lens gaps and angular distortions within the Gaussian splatting pipeline.

Result: Produces seamless 360-degree renderings from imperfect inputs and outperforms existing 360-degree rendering models on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms flawed omnidirectional inputs into high-quality novel view synthesis, addressing inherent limitations of consumer dual-fisheye camera systems.

Abstract: 360-degree visual content is widely shared on platforms such as YouTube and
plays a central role in virtual reality, robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, consumer-grade dual-fisheye systems consistently yield imperfect
panoramas due to inherent lens separation and angular distortions. In this
work, we introduce a novel calibration framework that incorporates a
dual-fisheye camera model into the 3D Gaussian splatting pipeline. Our approach
not only simulates the realistic visual artifacts produced by dual-fisheye
cameras but also enables the synthesis of seamlessly rendered 360-degree
images. By jointly optimizing 3D Gaussian parameters alongside calibration
variables that emulate lens gaps and angular distortions, our framework
transforms imperfect omnidirectional inputs into flawless novel view synthesis.
Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that our method produces
seamless renderings-even from imperfect images-and outperforms existing
360-degree rendering models.

*Yuxin Guo,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Shijie Ma,Yixiao Ge,Wei Zou,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AudioStory is a unified framework that combines LLMs with text-to-audio systems to generate coherent long-form audio narratives, addressing limitations of current TTA methods in handling temporal coherence and compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-audio generation systems excel at short audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio that requires temporal coherence, scene transitions, and emotional consistency over extended durations.

Method: Uses LLMs to decompose narrative queries into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues. Features a decoupled bridging mechanism with specialized components for intra-event semantic alignment and cross-event coherence preservation, all within an end-to-end training framework.

Result: AudioStory outperforms prior TTA baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity. The framework successfully generates structured long-form audio narratives across diverse domains including animated soundscapes and natural sound narratives.

Conclusion: AudioStory provides an effective solution for long-form audio narrative generation by integrating LLM reasoning with TTA systems, demonstrating superior performance and establishing a new benchmark (AudioStory-10K) for the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short
audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires
temporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose
AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)
with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory
possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It
employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered
sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and
emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)
Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser
collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for
intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence
preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension
and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory
eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy
between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,
encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound
narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both
single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA
baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity. Our code is

TL;DR: Lightweight moth classification using BioCLIP2 knowledge distillation achieves comparable accuracy to foundation models with reduced computational cost, enabling efficient insect monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate moth species identification from automated camera systems is crucial for monitoring insect declines, but challenging due to domain shifts between curated and field imagery.

Method: Combines limited expert-labelled field data with knowledge distillation from BioCLIP2 foundation model into a ConvNeXt-tiny architecture for lightweight classification.

Result: BioCLIP2 substantially outperforms other methods, and the distilled lightweight model achieves comparable accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost on 101 Danish moth species.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidelines for developing efficient insect monitoring systems and bridging domain gaps for fine-grained classification tasks.

Abstract: Labelling images of Lepidoptera (moths) from automated camera systems is
vital for understanding insect declines. However, accurate species
identification is challenging due to domain shifts between curated images and
noisy field imagery. We propose a lightweight classification approach,
combining limited expert-labelled field data with knowledge distillation from
the high-performance BioCLIP2 foundation model into a ConvNeXt-tiny
architecture. Experiments on 101 Danish moth species from AMI camera systems
demonstrate that BioCLIP2 substantially outperforms other methods and that our
distilled lightweight model achieves comparable accuracy with significantly
reduced computational cost. These insights offer practical guidelines for the
development of efficient insect monitoring systems and bridging domain gaps for
fine-grained classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between generalist agents (good at planning but poor execution) and specialized agents (good execution but poor planning) in GUI automation for scientific computing domains where high-quality data is scarce.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: 1) Specialization - decoupled GRPO approach to train expert planners for each application individually, 2) Generalization - aggregate successful trajectories for supervised fine-tuning of final planner. Combines generalist planner (Cerebrum) with specialist executor (Cerebellum).

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art among open-source models on four challenging applications from ScienceBoard benchmark.

Conclusion: CODA successfully bridges the planning-execution gap in GUI automation for scientific domains through its trainable compositional framework and two-stage training approach, enabling both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) face significant
challenges in specialized domains such as scientific computing, where both
long-horizon planning and precise execution are required. Existing approaches
suffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly
in execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness.
Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a
planner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which
prevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the
scarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these
limitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework
that integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor
(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,
Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner
for each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of
task trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all
successful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated
dataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.
This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.
Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,
CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art
among open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged high-intensity illumination in 4D live fluorescence microscopy causes photobleaching and phototoxic effects, compromising image quality and continuity while generating artifacts.

Method: Case-specific optimization approach based on implicit neural representation that employs blind convolution and structure amplification strategies to map 3D spatial coordinates into high frequency domain for precise modeling.

Conclusion: Offers a solid foundation for quantitative analyses and biological research by enabling high-accuracy reconstruction while distinguishing true signals from artifacts, with code and dataset made publicly available.

Abstract: 4D live fluorescence microscopy is often compromised by prolonged high

effectively distinguishing true signals from artifacts. Experimental results
demonstrate that CellINR significantly outperforms existing techniques in

reconstruction performance, thereby offering a solid foundation for subsequent
quantitative analyses and biological research. The code and dataset will be

*Utsav Ratna Tuladhar,Richard Simon,Doran Mix,Michael Richards*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework for elasticity imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms using ultrasound data to assess rupture risk beyond diameter measurements


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AAA risk assessment relies on maximum diameter which is insufficient as it doesn't capture vessel wall material properties critical for rupture risk determination

Method: U-Net architecture trained with normalized mean squared error on finite element simulation data to infer spatial modulus distribution from displacement fields in 2D ultrasound

Result: Achieved 0.73% NMSE in simulations, accurately predicted modular ratios in phantom data, and showed comparable performance to iterative methods with significantly faster computation

Conclusion: Deep learning provides quick, effective tissue stiffness estimates from ultrasound that could help non-invasively assess AAA rupture risk

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) pose a significant clinical risk due to
their potential for rupture, which is often asymptomatic but can be fatal.
Although maximum diameter is commonly used for risk assessment, diameter alone
is insufficient as it does not capture the properties of the underlying
material of the vessel wall, which play a critical role in determining the risk
of rupture. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning-based
framework for elasticity imaging of AAAs with 2D ultrasound. Leveraging finite
element simulations, we generate a diverse dataset of displacement fields with
their corresponding modulus distributions. We train a model with U-Net
architecture and normalized mean squared error (NMSE) to infer the spatial
modulus distribution from the axial and lateral components of the displacement
fields. This model is evaluated across three experimental domains: digital
phantom data from 3D COMSOL simulations, physical phantom experiments using
biomechanically distinct vessel models, and clinical ultrasound exams from AAA
patients. Our simulated results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning
model is able to reconstruct modulus distributions, achieving an NMSE score of
0.73\%. Similarly, in phantom data, the predicted modular ratio closely matches
the expected values, affirming the model's ability to generalize to phantom
data. We compare our approach with an iterative method which shows comparable
performance but higher computation time. In contrast, the deep learning method
can provide quick and effective estimates of tissue stiffness from ultrasound
images, which could help assess the risk of AAA rupture without invasive
procedures.

Motivation: Current sarcopenia diagnosis via ultrasound faces challenges due to subtle imaging cues, limited labeled data, and lack of clinical context integration in existing models.

Method: Multimodal framework with hierarchical image interpretation (anatomical classification, region segmentation, graph-based reasoning), gated feature-level fusion, and multi-hop multi-query retrieval from UMLS-guided PubMed and sarcopenia-specific knowledge bases.

Result: Achieved up to 99% diagnostic accuracy on MedVQA datasets (VQA-RAD, PathVQA) and custom sarcopenia ultrasound dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by over 10%.

Conclusion: Combining structured visual understanding with guided knowledge retrieval significantly improves AI-assisted sarcopenia diagnosis effectiveness.

Abstract: Accurate sarcopenia diagnosis via ultrasound remains challenging due to
subtle imaging cues, limited labeled data, and the absence of clinical context
in most models. We propose MedVQA-TREE, a multimodal framework that integrates
a hierarchical image interpretation module, a gated feature-level fusion
mechanism, and a novel multi-hop, multi-query retrieval strategy. The vision
module includes anatomical classification, region segmentation, and graph-based
spatial reasoning to capture coarse, mid-level, and fine-grained structures. A
gated fusion mechanism selectively integrates visual features with textual
queries, while clinical knowledge is retrieved through a UMLS-guided pipeline
accessing PubMed and a sarcopenia-specific external knowledge base. MedVQA-TREE
was trained and evaluated on two public MedVQA datasets (VQA-RAD and PathVQA)
and a custom sarcopenia ultrasound dataset. The model achieved up to 99%
diagnostic accuracy and outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods by over
10%. These results underscore the benefit of combining structured visual
understanding with guided knowledge retrieval for effective AI-assisted
diagnosis in sarcopenia.

### [153] [AT-CXR: Uncertainty-Aware Agentic Triage for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19322)
*Xueyang Li,Mingze Jiang,Gelei Xu,Jun Xia,Mengzhao Jia,Danny Chen,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AT-CXR is an uncertainty-aware AI agent for chest X-ray triage that automatically decides when to stop, escalate, or defer cases under clinical constraints, outperforming existing methods with higher accuracy and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous medical-imaging triage systems that can make real-time decisions under constraints remain underexplored, despite rapid advances in agentic AI.

Method: Developed two router designs: deterministic rule-based router and LLM-decided router that estimate per-case confidence and distributional fit, following stepwise policies to issue automated decisions or abstain with suggested labels.

Result: Both router variants outperformed zero-shot vision-language models and state-of-the-art supervised classifiers, achieving higher full-coverage accuracy, superior selective-prediction performance (lower AURC and error rate), and lower latency meeting clinical constraints.

Conclusion: The two routers provide complementary operating points for clinical deployment, enabling prioritization of either maximal throughput or maximal accuracy in chest X-ray triage systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI is advancing rapidly, yet truly autonomous medical-imaging triage,
where a system decides when to stop, escalate, or defer under real constraints,
remains relatively underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AT-CXR, an
uncertainty-aware agent for chest X-rays. The system estimates per-case
confidence and distributional fit, then follows a stepwise policy to issue an
automated decision or abstain with a suggested label for human intervention. We
evaluate two router designs that share the same inputs and actions: a
deterministic rule-based router and an LLM-decided router. Across five-fold
evaluation on a balanced subset of NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, both variants
outperform strong zero-shot vision-language models and state-of-the-art
supervised classifiers, achieving higher full-coverage accuracy and superior
selective-prediction performance, evidenced by a lower area under the
risk-coverage curve (AURC) and a lower error rate at high coverage, while
operating with lower latency that meets practical clinical constraints. The two
routers provide complementary operating points, enabling deployments to
prioritize maximal throughput or maximal accuracy. Our code is available at

*Tian Qiu,Alan Zoubi,Yiyuan Lin,Ruiming Du,Lailiang Cheng,Yu Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DATR framework enables high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of apple trees from sparse field views using a two-stage approach with foundation models and diffusion techniques, achieving 360x throughput improvement over laser scanners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods struggle with sparse and occluded views in field conditions, limiting digital twin applications for agricultural monitoring and simulation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Semi-automatic tree mask generation using onboard sensors and foundation models to filter background, 2) Single-image-to-3D reconstruction using diffusion model for multi-view generation and large reconstruction model for implicit neural fields, trained on synthetic apple trees from Real2Sim data generator.

Result: Outperformed existing 3D reconstruction methods on both field and synthetic datasets, achieved domain-trait estimation comparable to industrial laser scanners with ~360 times higher throughput.

Conclusion: DATR demonstrates strong potential for scalable agricultural digital twin systems by enabling efficient, high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse field views.

Abstract: Digital twin applications offered transformative potential by enabling
real-time monitoring and robotic simulation through accurate virtual replicas
of physical assets. The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high
geometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field
conditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a
two-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse
views. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to
semi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks
are used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the
single-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a
diffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and
implicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM
was achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim
data generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic
datasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground
truth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees.
Evaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D
reconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait
estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while
improving the throughput by $\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for
scalable agricultural digital twin systems.

*Sena Ishii,Akash Chikhalikar,Ankit A. Ravankar,Jose Victorio Salazar Luces,Yasuhisa Hirata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel framework for estimating accident-prone regions in indoor scenes using semantic graph-based risk propagation to enhance robot safety awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robots integrate into daily life, particularly in homes, anticipating environmental hazards is crucial for user safety, trust, and effective human-robot interaction.

Method: Models object-level risk through semantic graph-based propagation algorithm where each object is a node with risk score, and risk propagates asymmetrically based on spatial proximity and accident relationships.

Result: Achieved 75% binary risk detection accuracy on human-annotated dataset, with strong alignment to human perception especially for sharp or unstable objects.

Conclusion: Framework shows potential for context-aware risk reasoning to enhance robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared human-robot spaces.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for estimating accident-prone regions in
everyday indoor scenes, aimed at improving real-time risk awareness in service
robots operating in human-centric environments. As robots become integrated
into daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond
to environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and
effective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and
context through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is
represented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates
asymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity
and accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards
even when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for
interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on
a dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection
accuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human
perception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These
results underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance
robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared
human-robot spaces. This framework could serve as a foundation for future
systems that make context-driven safety decisions, provide real-time alerts, or
autonomously assist users in avoiding or mitigating hazards within home
environments.

TL;DR: Analysis of prefix normal words properties and relationships using word chains and generators


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open problems in enumeration and efficient testing of prefix normal words by exploring their structural characteristics

Method: Introduce word chains and generators to relate words of same length, analyze properties of factors that cause words to not be prefix normal

Result: Shows range of characteristics of prefix normal words and properties of problematic factors

Conclusion: New methods for relating prefix normal words provide insights for solving enumeration and testing challenges

Abstract: In 2011, Fici and Lipt\'ak introduced prefix normal words. A binary word is
prefix normal if it has no factor (substring) that contains more occurrences of
the letter 1 than the prefix of the same length. Among the open problems
regarding this topic are the enumeration of prefix normal words and efficient
testing methods. We show a range of characteristics of prefix normal words.
These include properties of factors that are responsible for a word not being
prefix normal. With word chains and generators, we introduce new ways of
relating words of the same length to each other.

*Zhuohao Li,Wenqing Chen,Jianxing Yu,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM code embeddings show strong performance but unclear functional semantic understanding. A new framework generates diverse code variations to test functional consistency, improving embedding model performance on code tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on syntactic similarity in code clone detection but overlook functional understanding. The paper aims to evaluate whether LLM code embeddings can capture functional semantics beyond just syntactic patterns.

Method: Proposes Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution framework to synthesize diverse code benchmarks. Generates four unique variations from single code instances across semantic and syntactic categories to better reflect functional differences.

Result: Extensive experiments on code clone detection, functional consistency identification, and code retrieval show embedding models significantly improve performance when trained on the evolved datasets.

Conclusion: The data synthesis framework effectively advances functional understanding of code and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for improving code embedding models.

Abstract: Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like
clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational
advantages over generative models and cross-encoders. Benchmarks such as MTEB
have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich
semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional
semantics remains unclear. Existing studies largely focus on code clone
detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional
understanding. In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM
code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same
function regardless of syntactic differences. We propose a novel data synthesis
framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct
diverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples
across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets
predominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique
variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code
examples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on
three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency
identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models
significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets.
These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data
synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.

*Luvin Munish Ragoo,Ivar Farup,Casper F. Andersen,Graham Finlayson*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Spectral filtering approach transforms color-matching functions between different observer datasets using a single filter instead of three functions, explaining age-related differences through lens yellowing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model observer variability in color vision, particularly differences between color-matching function datasets from different studies with age-disparate observer groups.

Method: Conducted color matching experiments with/without spectral filters, developed computational approach to estimate filter transmittance and transformation matrices, applied methodology to compare SB1955 and ICVIO CMF datasets.

Result: Good agreement between estimated and measured filter characteristics, identified yellow (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that transforms between SB1955 and ICVIO datasets, supporting age-related lens yellowing hypothesis.

Conclusion: Single spectral filter approach efficiently represents observer variability with reduced experimental overhead while maintaining accuracy in characterizing individual color vision differences.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spectral filtering on color-matching
functions (CMFs) and its implications for observer variability modeling. We
conducted color matching experiments with a single observer, both with and
without a spectral filter in front of a bipartite field. Using a novel
computational approach, we estimated the filter transmittance and
transformation matrix necessary to convert unfiltered CMFs to filtered CMFs.
Statistical analysis revealed good agreement between estimated and measured
filter characteristics, particularly in central wavelength regions. Applying
this methodology to compare between Stiles and Burch 1955 (SB1955) mean
observer CMFs and our previously published "ICVIO" mean observer CMFs, we
identified a "yellow" (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that effectively
transforms between these datasets. This finding aligns with our hypothesis that
observed differences between the CMF sets are attributable to age-related lens
yellowing (average observer age: 49 years in ICVIO versus 30 years in SB1955).
Our approach enables efficient representation of observer variability through a
single filter rather than three separate functions, offering potentially
reduced experimental overhead while maintaining accuracy in characterizing
individual color vision differences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-5's performance across practical domains of importance, particularly education, clinical practice, and academic research, given the rapid evolution of large language models.

Method: Twenty expert human raters from linguistics and clinical fields evaluated model-generated outputs across five domains (lesson planning, assignment evaluation, clinical diagnosis, research generation, ethical reasoning) using predefined criteria. Mixed-effects models were used for statistical analysis.

Result: GPT-5 significantly outperformed GPT-4 in four out of five domains: lesson planning, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning. Both models performed comparably in assignment assessment.

Conclusion: GPT-5 demonstrates superior performance as a context-sensitive and domain-specialized tool with tangible benefits for education, clinical practice, and academic research, while also advancing ethical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The accelerated evolution of large language models has raised questions about
their comparative performance across domains of practical importance. GPT-4 by
OpenAI introduced advances in reasoning, multimodality, and task
generalization, establishing itself as a valuable tool in education, clinical
diagnosis, and academic writing, though it was accompanied by several flaws.
Released in August 2025, GPT-5 incorporates a system-of-models architecture
designed for task-specific optimization and, based on both anecdotal accounts
and emerging evidence from the literature, demonstrates stronger performance
than its predecessor in medical contexts. This study provides one of the first
systematic comparisons of GPT-4 and GPT-5 using human raters from linguistics
and clinical fields. Twenty experts evaluated model-generated outputs across
five domains: lesson planning, assignment evaluation, clinical diagnosis,
research generation, and ethical reasoning, based on predefined criteria.
Mixed-effects models revealed that GPT-5 significantly outperformed GPT-4 in
lesson planning, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical
reasoning, while both models performed comparably in assignment assessment. The
findings highlight the potential of GPT-5 to serve as a context-sensitive and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional affine-transform methods for facial texture transfer are slow and produce visual artifacts, limiting their practicality for immersive XR applications that require real-time personalization.

Method: Utilizes a barycentric UV conversion technique that precomputes the entire UV mapping into a single transformation matrix, enabling texture transfer in a single operation.

Result: Achieves over 7000x speedup compared to baseline methods while significantly improving texture quality by eliminating boundary artifacts. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate superior performance.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for avatar personalization in immersive XR applications, offering both speed and quality improvements over existing approaches. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: We present a fast and efficient method for transferring facial textures onto
SMPL-X-based full-body avatars. Unlike conventional affine-transform methods
that are slow and prone to visual artifacts, our method utilizes a barycentric

This results in a speedup of over 7000x compared to the baseline, while also

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs trained on WEIRD data show cultural bias; models with less WEIRD alignment produce more diverse but 2-4% more human rights-violating outputs, especially on gender issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about cultural bias and fairness in LLMs trained primarily on Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) data, raising questions about their alignment with global human rights principles.

Method: Evaluated five LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-3, BLOOM, Qwen) using World Values Survey responses, measuring alignment with WEIRD values and human rights principles from Universal Declaration of Human Rights and three regional charters.

Result: Models with lower WEIRD alignment (BLOOM, Qwen) produced more culturally varied responses but were 2-4% more likely to violate human rights, particularly regarding gender equality. Some models endorsed harmful gender norms.

Conclusion: Increasing cultural representation in LLMs may paradoxically increase reproduction of discriminatory beliefs; Constitutional AI approaches may only partially resolve this tension between cultural diversity and human rights protection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on data that reflect WEIRD
values: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. This raises
concerns about cultural bias and fairness. Using responses to the World Values
Survey, we evaluated five widely used LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-3, BLOOM, and
Qwen. We measured how closely these responses aligned with the values of the
WEIRD countries and whether they conflicted with human rights principles. To
reflect global diversity, we compared the results with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and three regional charters from Asia, the Middle
East, and Africa. Models with lower alignment to WEIRD values, such as BLOOM
and Qwen, produced more culturally varied responses but were 2% to 4% more
likely to generate outputs that violated human rights, especially regarding
gender and equality. For example, some models agreed with the statements ``a
man who cannot father children is not a real man'' and ``a husband should
always know where his wife is'', reflecting harmful gender norms. These
findings suggest that as cultural representation in LLMs increases, so does the
risk of reproducing discriminatory beliefs. Approaches such as Constitutional
AI, which could embed human rights principles into model behavior, may only
partly help resolve this tension.

TL;DR: Study shows systematic differences in news quality assessments between Chinese and Western LLMs, with geopolitical biases affecting subjectivity, emotion, and quality metrics in sensitive topics like Palestine and China-US coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how geopolitical biases in large language models affect news quality and subjectivity assessments, particularly given the contested nature of objectivity in journalism and the potential for algorithmic systems to embed cultural or ideological biases.

Method: Compared article-level embeddings from Chinese-origin (Qwen, BGE, Jina) and Western-origin (Snowflake, Granite) model families using human-annotated news quality benchmarks and parallel corpora on politically sensitive topics. Employed logistic regression probes and matched-topic evaluation to quantify differences in predicted probabilities.

Result: Consistent, non-random divergences aligned with model origin: Western models assigned higher subjectivity and positive emotion scores in Palestine coverage, while Chinese models emphasized novelty and descriptiveness. Chinese models scored US coverage lower in fluency, conciseness, technicality, and overall quality but higher in negative emotion.

Conclusion: LLM-based media evaluation pipelines require cultural calibration to avoid conflating content differences with model-induced bias, as geopolitical framing effects persist in downstream quality assessment tasks.

Abstract: Objectivity in journalism has long been contested, oscillating between ideals
of neutral, fact-based reporting and the inevitability of subjective framing.
With the advent of large language models (LLMs), these tensions are now
mediated by algorithmic systems whose training data and design choices may
themselves embed cultural or ideological biases. This study investigates
geopolitical parallax-systematic divergence in news quality and subjectivity
assessments-by comparing article-level embeddings from Chinese-origin (Qwen,
BGE, Jina) and Western-origin (Snowflake, Granite) model families. We evaluate
both on a human-annotated news quality benchmark spanning fifteen stylistic,
informational, and affective dimensions, and on parallel corpora covering
politically sensitive topics, including Palestine and reciprocal China-United
States coverage. Using logistic regression probes and matched-topic evaluation,
we quantify per-metric differences in predicted positive-class probabilities
between model families. Our findings reveal consistent, non-random divergences
aligned with model origin. In Palestine-related coverage, Western models assign
higher subjectivity and positive emotion scores, while Chinese models emphasize
novelty and descriptiveness. Cross-topic analysis shows asymmetries in
structural quality metrics Chinese-on-US scoring notably lower in fluency,
conciseness, technicality, and overall quality-contrasted by higher negative
emotion scores. These patterns align with media bias theory and our distinction
between semantic, emotional, and relational subjectivity, and extend LLM bias
literature by showing that geopolitical framing effects persist in downstream
quality assessment tasks. We conclude that LLM-based media evaluation pipelines
require cultural calibration to avoid conflating content differences with
model-induced bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding failure modes of LLMs during user interactions, particularly when users pose multiple questions in single conversations.

Method: Propose Group Query Attack technique that presents groups of queries to LLMs simultaneously to investigate how accumulated context from consecutive prompts influences outputs.

Result: Significant performance degradation in fine-tuned models, induces backdoor triggering risks, and effective against reasoning tasks in pre-trained and aligned models.

Conclusion: Group Query Attack reveals critical vulnerabilities in LLMs, demonstrating that accumulated query contexts can be exploited to degrade performance and trigger hidden backdoors.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), understanding their
potential failure modes during user interactions is essential. In practice,
users often pose multiple questions in a single conversation with LLMs.
Therefore, in this study, we propose Group Query Attack, a technique that
simulates this scenario by presenting groups of queries to LLMs simultaneously.
We investigate how the accumulated context from consecutive prompts influences
the outputs of LLMs. Specifically, we observe that Group Query Attack
significantly degrades the performance of models fine-tuned on specific tasks.
Moreover, we demonstrate that Group Query Attack induces a risk of triggering
potential backdoors of LLMs. Besides, Group Query Attack is also effective in
tasks involving reasoning, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation
for pre-trained and aligned models.

### [165] [Safety Alignment Should Be Made More Than Just A Few Attention Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19697)
*Chao Huang,Zefeng Zhang,Juewei Yue,Quangang Li,Chuang Zhang,Tingwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Current LLM safety mechanisms rely on a small subset of attention heads, making them vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. The paper introduces RDSHA to identify these critical heads and proposes AHD training to distribute safety behaviors across more heads, resulting in stronger safety robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment for large language models remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks because safety mechanisms are concentrated in a limited number of attention heads, making them easy targets for jailbreak techniques.

Method: The paper introduces RDSHA (targeted ablation method using refusal direction) to identify safety-critical attention heads, and proposes AHD (novel training strategy) to distribute safety-related behaviors across numerous attention heads rather than concentrating them in a few.

Result: Experimental results show that AHD successfully distributes safety-related capabilities across more attention heads. Models trained with AHD exhibit significantly stronger safety robustness against mainstream jailbreak attacks while maintaining overall functional utility.

Conclusion: Distributing safety mechanisms across multiple attention heads through targeted training strategies like AHD provides stronger protection against jailbreak attacks compared to current concentrated safety alignment approaches, addressing a fundamental vulnerability in LLM safety.

Abstract: Current safety alignment for large language models(LLMs) continues to present
vulnerabilities, given that adversarial prompting can effectively bypass their
safety measures.Our investigation shows that these safety mechanisms
predominantly depend on a limited subset of attention heads: removing or
ablating these heads can severely compromise model safety. To identify and
evaluate these safety-critical components, we introduce RDSHA, a targeted
ablation method that leverages the model's refusal direction to pinpoint
attention heads mostly responsible for safety behaviors. Further analysis shows
that existing jailbreak attacks exploit this concentration by selectively
bypassing or manipulating these critical attention heads. To address this
issue, we propose AHD, a novel training strategy designed to promote the
distributed encoding of safety-related behaviors across numerous attention
heads. Experimental results demonstrate that AHD successfully distributes
safety-related capabilities across more attention heads. Moreover, evaluations
under several mainstream jailbreak attacks show that models trained with AHD
exhibit considerably stronger safety robustness, while maintaining overall
functional utility.

Motivation: Large Language Models are valuable intellectual property but vulnerable to copyright infringement and model theft. LLM fingerprinting offers a non-intrusive solution for copyright auditing, but its reliability remains uncertain due to diverse model modifications and lack of standardized evaluation.

Method: The authors introduce a unified framework and formal taxonomy categorizing existing fingerprinting methods into white-box and black-box approaches. They propose LeaFBench, a systematic benchmark built on mainstream foundation models with 149 distinct instances, integrating 13 representative post-development techniques including fine-tuning, quantization, system prompts, and RAG.

Result: Extensive experiments on LeaFBench reveal the strengths and weaknesses of existing LLM fingerprinting methods, providing insights into their performance under various realistic deployment scenarios and model modifications.

Conclusion: The study outlines future research directions and critical open problems in LLM fingerprinting, establishing a foundation for standardized evaluation and advancing copyright protection for large language models.

Abstract: The broad capabilities and substantial resources required to train Large
Language Models (LLMs) make them valuable intellectual property, yet they
remain vulnerable to copyright infringement, such as unauthorized use and model
theft. LLM fingerprinting, a non-intrusive technique that extracts and compares
the distinctive features from LLMs to identify infringements, offers a
promising solution to copyright auditing. However, its reliability remains
uncertain due to the prevalence of diverse model modifications and the lack of
standardized evaluation. In this SoK, we present the first comprehensive study
of LLM fingerprinting. We introduce a unified framework and formal taxonomy
that categorizes existing methods into white-box and black-box approaches,
providing a structured overview of the state of the art. We further propose
LeaFBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM fingerprinting
under realistic deployment scenarios. Built upon mainstream foundation models
and comprising 149 distinct model instances, LeaFBench integrates 13
representative post-development techniques, spanning both parameter-altering
methods (e.g., fine-tuning, quantization) and parameter-independent mechanisms
(e.g., system prompts, RAG). Extensive experiments on LeaFBench reveal the
strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby outlining future research
directions and critical open problems in this emerging field. The code is

TL;DR: DisarmRAG is a new poisoning attack that targets the retriever in RAG systems to bypass LLMs' self-correction ability, achieving over 90% attack success by embedding anti-SCA instructions through contrastive-learning-based model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RAG poisoning attacks focused on knowledge base manipulation, but modern LLMs' strong self-correction ability can reject false context. This paper aims to overcome this defense by attacking the retriever component directly.

Method: Uses contrastive-learning-based model editing to perform localized edits on the retriever, ensuring it returns malicious instructions only for specific queries while maintaining normal behavior otherwise. Includes iterative co-optimization to discover robust instructions that bypass prompt-based defenses.

Result: Achieves near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions, suppresses SCA effectively, and reaches attack success rates exceeding 90% across six LLMs and three QA benchmarks. The edited retriever remains stealthy against detection methods.

Conclusion: DisarmRAG demonstrates a new vulnerability in RAG systems by compromising the retriever, highlighting the urgent need for retriever-centric defenses beyond traditional knowledge base protection.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a standard approach for
improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Prior work
demonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into
generating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base.
However, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong
\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false
context once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for
attackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.
  In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the
knowledge base, we introduce \textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that
compromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce
attacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to
straightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the
generator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a
contrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and
stealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for
specific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further
strengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that
automatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based
defenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA
benchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions,
which successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\%
under diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy
under several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for
retriever-centric defenses.

*Ms. Preeti P. Bhatt,Rakesh R. Savant*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper reviews and compares six image steganography tools, testing their performance with the same input data across different image formats and analyzing them based on image features like size, dimensions, pixel values, and histogram differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify image steganography methods and provide a comparative analysis of various steganography tools to identify the best performing ones based on their efficiency and image feature preservation.

Method: Selected six commonly used steganography tools and tested them using the same input data (specific text embedded in host images). Analyzed tools based on image features including size, dimensions, pixel values, and histogram differentiation.

Result: All six tools performed at relatively similar levels, though some showed better efficiency than others. Performance differences were based on how well they preserved image features during the steganography process.

Conclusion: The study provides a comparative framework for evaluating steganography tools and demonstrates that while most tools perform similarly, efficiency varies based on image feature preservation capabilities.

Abstract: Steganography is technique of hiding a data under cover media using different
steganography tools. Image steganography is hiding of data
(Text/Image/Audio/Video) under a cover as Image. This review paper presents
classification of image steganography and the comparison of various Image
steganography tools using different image formats. Analyzing numerous tools on
the basis of Image features and extracting the best one. Some of the tools
available in the market were selected based on the frequent use; these tools
were tested using the same input on all of them. Specific text was embedded
within all host images for each of the six Steganography tools selected. The
results of the experiment reveal that all the six tools were relatively
performing at the same level, though some software performs better than others
through efficiency. And it was based on the image features like size,
dimensions, and pixel value and histogram differentiation.

*Zhixin Lin,Jungang Li,Shidong Pan,Yibo Shi,Yue Yao,Dongliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: First large-scale benchmark study (7,138 scenarios) reveals smartphone agents powered by MLLMs have poor privacy awareness (<60% even with hints), with closed-source agents performing better than open-source ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphone agents have extensive access to sensitive personal information but their privacy awareness capabilities are not well understood, creating potential privacy risks for users.

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark with 7,138 scenarios annotated by privacy type, sensitivity level, and location, then evaluated seven mainstream smartphone agents on their privacy awareness capabilities.

Result: Most agents showed unsatisfying privacy awareness (below 60%), with closed-source agents outperforming open-source ones. Gemini 2.0-flash performed best at 67% RA. Privacy detection correlated with scenario sensitivity levels.

Conclusion: Current smartphone agents demonstrate inadequate privacy protection, highlighting an unbalanced utility-privacy tradeoff that requires attention from the research community.

Abstract: Smartphones bring significant convenience to users but also enable devices to
extensively record various types of personal information. Existing smartphone
agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable performance in automating different tasks. However, as the cost,
these agents are granted substantial access to sensitive users' personal
information during this operation. To gain a thorough understanding of the
privacy awareness of these agents, we present the first large-scale benchmark
encompassing 7,138 scenarios to the best of our knowledge. In addition, for
privacy context in scenarios, we annotate its type (e.g., Account Credentials),
sensitivity level, and location. We then carefully benchmark seven available
mainstream smartphone agents. Our results demonstrate that almost all
benchmarked agents show unsatisfying privacy awareness (RA), with performance
remaining below 60% even with explicit hints. Overall, closed-source agents
show better privacy ability than open-source ones, and Gemini 2.0-flash
achieves the best, achieving an RA of 67%. We also find that the agents'
privacy detection capability is highly related to scenario sensitivity level,
i.e., the scenario with a higher sensitivity level is typically more
identifiable. We hope the findings enlighten the research community to rethink
the unbalanced utility-privacy tradeoff about smartphone agents. Our code and
benchmark are available at https://zhixin-l.github.io/SAPA-Bench.

### [171] [Saccade crossing avoidance as a visual search strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18404)
*Alex Szorkovszky,Rujeena Mathema,Pedro Lencastre,Pedro Lind,Anis Yazidi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Study reveals a new oculomotor bias called 'self-crossing avoidance' where saccades tend to avoid crossing earlier scan paths, particularly with small amplitudes, lasting about 7 seconds and varying significantly between individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of longer path history on visual search patterns and identify new memory-dependent effects in eye movements during complex visual tasks.

Method: Used step-selection framework from movement ecology, analyzed 45-second viewings of "Where's Waldo" images, compared real data to synthetic memoryless models, employed maximum likelihood fitting and mixed-effect regressions to quantify individual differences.

Result: Found significant self-crossing avoidance effect strongest when including last ~7 seconds of scan path, comparable to inhibition of return. Participants with higher crossing avoidance showed smaller saccade lengths and shorter fixation durations.

Conclusion: Self-crossing avoidance is a local orienting strategy that complements inhibition of return and facilitates visual scene exploration, representing a new memory-dependent effect in oculomotor control.

Abstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases
exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the
previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the
longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection
framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second
viewings of "Where's Waldo"?, we report a new memory-dependent effect that also
varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing
avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in
the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show
this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless
approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model
with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood
fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last
$\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known
forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric
probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to
reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also
quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six
images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants
with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and
shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal,
vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that
the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and
complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.

*Shreyans Jain,Alexandra Yost,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes modeling LLM sycophancy as geometric compositions of psychometric traits rather than treating it as an isolated failure mode, using Contrastive Activation Addition to map activation directions and enable interpretable interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs that is often treated as an isolated failure mode with a single causal mechanism, but the authors believe it should be understood through more nuanced psychometric trait compositions.

Method: Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) to map activation directions to psychometric factors (emotionality, openness, agreeableness) and study how different trait combinations give rise to sycophantic behavior.

Result: The approach provides a framework for understanding sycophancy through factor decomposition similar to psychometrics, revealing how specific trait combinations (e.g., high extraversion + low conscientiousness) contribute to sycophantic behavior.

Conclusion: This geometric and causal composition perspective enables interpretable vector-based interventions (addition, subtraction, projection) that can be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors like sycophancy in LLMs.

Abstract: Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs, yet is often treated as an
isolated failure mode that occurs via a single causal mechanism. We instead
propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits
such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor
decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we
map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations
may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low
conscientiousness). This perspective allows for interpretable and compositional
vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction and projection; that may
be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors in LLMs.

flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate
Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and
show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness and faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought reasoning in soft-reasoning problems like analytical and commonsense reasoning, where CoT has shown limited gains and potential unfaithfulness.

Method: Analyzed the dynamics and faithfulness of CoT across different model types including instruction-tuned models, reasoning models, and reasoning-distilled models on soft-reasoning tasks.

Result: Found significant differences in how various model types rely on CoT, and discovered that CoT influence and faithfulness are not always aligned across different models.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has varying impacts and faithfulness issues in soft-reasoning tasks, suggesting the need for careful consideration when applying CoT to different model architectures and reasoning domains.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often yields limited
gains for soft-reasoning problems such as analytical and commonsense reasoning.
CoT can also be unfaithful to a model's actual reasoning. We investigate the
dynamics and faithfulness of CoT in soft-reasoning tasks across

reveal differences in how these models rely on CoT, and show that CoT influence

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWIRL is a staged workflow for multi-agent reinforcement learning that reformulates MARL into sequential single-agent tasks, enabling stable training and efficient coordination for mobile GUI agents and other multi-agent applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-agent approaches for mobile GUI agents have structural limitations, while multi-agent reinforcement learning suffers from inefficiency and incompatibility with current large vision language model architectures.

Method: SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping others fixed. It uses a Navigator to convert language and screen context into plans, and an Interactor to ground plans into executable actions.

Result: Superior performance on both high-level and low-level GUI benchmarks, and strong capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, demonstrating robust optimization with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: SWIRL provides a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems with theoretical safety bounds, monotonic improvement guarantees, and convergence properties.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent
systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably
translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent
approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although
multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress
in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by
inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To
address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved
reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates
MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one
agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable
training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we
provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,
and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled
optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a
Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and
an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and
low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong
capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as
a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.

*Xiaodong Cui,A F M Saif,Brian Kingsbury,Tianyi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new self-supervised pre-training approach using bilevel optimization with equilibrium constraints to handle heterogeneous data, improving model adaptivity for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional self-supervised pre-training mixes all heterogeneous data and minimizes global loss, which may not optimize each data source effectively. The paper aims to ensure models reach local optima for each heterogeneous data source.

Method: Formulate as bilevel optimization problem with equilibrium constraints, using first-order approximation method. Each data source is optimized to local optima after K-step gradient descent from the model initialization. Connected to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML).

Result: Experiments on multi-domain and multilingual datasets show significant improvement in adaptivity of self-supervised pre-trained models for downstream supervised fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach with equilibrium constraints effectively handles heterogeneous data in self-supervised pre-training, leading to better model adaptivity compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is widely used in machine
learning. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach
to dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and
minimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose
additional equilibrium constraints to ensure that the models optimizes each
source of heterogeneous data to its local optima after $K$-step gradient
descent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization
problem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We
discuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Experiments are
carried out on self-supervised pre-training using multi-domain and multilingual
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach can significantly improve
the adaptivity of the self-supervised pre-trained model for the downstream
supervised fine-tuning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A gradient-based algorithm for efficiently selecting optimal demonstration examples for in-context learning, achieving 37.7x speedup and 11% better performance than embedding-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of quickly selecting the most relevant k examples from n candidates for in-context learning, as current methods based on token embedding similarity have limitations and full inference is computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes a gradient-based approach that estimates model outputs through first-order approximation using gradients in input embedding space, samples multiple random subsets, aggregates influence scores, and selects top-k examples - requiring only one-time pre-computation of outputs and gradients.

Result: Achieves less than 1% error in approximating full inference across six datasets, scales subset selection by up to 37.7x on models with 34B parameters, and outperforms embedding-based methods by 11% on average.

Conclusion: The gradient estimation procedure provides an efficient and accurate method for demonstration example selection in in-context learning, enabling practical application in prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning with significant computational savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for
in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we
quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream
inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context
learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of
token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the
output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs
through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this
estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the
sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and
select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing
model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative
to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models
and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient
estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than
$\mathbf{1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset
selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to
$\mathbf{37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and
outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by
$\mathbf{11}\%$ on average.

*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention-head pruning strategies can effectively defend against backdoor attacks in pre-trained language models without trigger knowledge or clean reference models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks pose serious threats to language models and can survive standard fine-tuning, making post-hoc purification essential since users typically lack trigger knowledge.

Method: Six pruning strategies: gradient-based pruning, layer-wise variance pruning, gradient-based with L1/L2 sparsification, randomized ensemble pruning, reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and Bayesian uncertainty pruning. Each removes least informative heads while monitoring validation accuracy.

Result: Gradient-based pruning performs best against syntactic triggers, while reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic attacks.

Conclusion: Attention-head pruning provides an effective defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in language models without requiring trigger knowledge or clean reference models.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to the performance and integrity of
pre-trained language models. Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for
downstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor
attacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend
because end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks
consist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or
stylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in
the model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore
whether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge
of the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and
implement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)
layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2
sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)
reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.
Each method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring
validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that
gradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers,
whereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic
attacks.

*Marcin Osial,Bartosz Wójcik,Bartosz Zieliński,Sebastian Cygert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-source transfer learning framework using SVD decomposition to efficiently extract and aggregate knowledge from multiple source models, overcoming previous efficiency and precision limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer learning overlooks the opportunity to leverage knowledge from numerous available online models. Existing multi-source approaches are coarse-grained and lack efficiency for handling many source models or high-parameter models.

Method: Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose each source model into rank-one components, then aggregates the most salient components across all sources. Adapts to target tasks by fine-tuning only principal singular values of the merged matrix.

Result: The framework enables efficient transfer learning, is robust to input and parameter perturbations (noisy/pruned sources), and scales well computationally.

Conclusion: SVD-based decomposition and selective aggregation provides an effective solution for multi-source transfer learning, offering precision, efficiency, and robustness compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: While transfer learning is an advantageous strategy, it overlooks the
opportunity to leverage knowledge from numerous available models online.
Addressing this multi-source transfer learning problem is a promising path to
boost adaptability and cut re-training costs. However, existing approaches are
inherently coarse-grained, lacking the necessary precision for granular
knowledge extraction and the aggregation efficiency required to fuse knowledge
from either a large number of source models or those with high parameter
counts. We address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to first decompose each source model into its elementary, rank-one
components. A subsequent aggregation stage then selects only the most salient
components from all sources, thereby overcoming the previous efficiency and
precision limitations. To best preserve and leverage the synthesized knowledge
base, our method adapts to the target task by fine-tuning only the principal
singular values of the merged matrix. In essence, this process only
recalibrates the importance of top SVD components. The proposed framework
allows for efficient transfer learning, is robust to perturbations both at the
input level and in the parameter space (e.g., noisy or pruned sources), and
scales well computationally.

Motivation: Address limitations of standard CNNs that rely solely on global gradient-based optimization, which can cause overfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase 1 combines cross-entropy loss with Hebbian regularization and neuromodulator-gated consolidation; Phase 2 uses pairwise metric learning for fine-tuning to compress intra-class distances and enlarge inter-class margins.

Result: Consistent gains across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet with five backbones: +2.0-10.0 pp accuracy improvement, +0.15 NMI increase, and more structured/selective features with tighter class clusters.

Conclusion: Integrating local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning produces CNNs that are both more accurate and interpretable, beneficial for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI applications.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often
rely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to
overfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these
limitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates
neuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1
extends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy
objective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser
that aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding
convolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and
(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style
consolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the
network. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,
explicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins
in the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet
across five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,
DenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other
methods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp
(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual
Information (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and
filter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and
selective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters.
Overall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields
CNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering
practical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.
