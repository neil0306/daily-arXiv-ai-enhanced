*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Kaitong Cai,Zimeng Huang,Xiaofei Sun,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrDiff is a novel framework for efficient long-text generation that uses dynamic expert scheduling, hierarchical sparse attention, and soft absorption guidance to overcome the efficiency-quality trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the efficiency-quality trade-off in long-text generation by developing a more computationally efficient framework that maintains high performance while reducing computational complexity.

Method: Three core technologies: 1) Dynamic expert scheduling for intelligent resource allocation, 2) Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n), 3) Soft absorption guidance optimization with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DrDiff successfully overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off in long-text generation through its innovative combination of dynamic resource allocation, efficient attention mechanisms, and optimization strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

### [2] [SSVD: Structured SVD for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking under Domain Shift in ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02830)
*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art PEFT methods (including a new SSVD approach) for speech recognition tasks, evaluating them on domain-shifted scenarios like child speech and dialects across various model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PEFT methods like LoRA are widely used in speech applications, their advanced variants (VeRA, DoRA, PiSSA, SVFT) were mainly developed for language/vision tasks with limited validation in speech domains, creating a gap in understanding their effectiveness for speech adaptation.

Method: The authors integrate and benchmark multiple PEFT methods in ESPnet framework, and introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning that selectively rotates input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors fixed to preserve semantic mappings.

Result: The methods were evaluated on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks including child speech and dialectal variation across model scales from 0.1B to 2B parameters. SSVD demonstrated robust domain adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency.

Conclusion: The comprehensive benchmarking provides valuable insights into PEFT methods for speech applications, and the SSVD approach offers an efficient solution for domain adaptation. All implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future research in speech PEFT methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

### [3] [Clustering Discourses: Racial Biases in Short Stories about Women Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02834)
*Gustavo Bonil,João Gondim,Marina dos Santos,Simone Hashiguti,Helena Maia,Nadia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaMA 3.2-3B generates narratives about Black and white women in Portuguese that reveal colonial framing and reinforce historical inequalities through three main discursive representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how large language models construct narratives about racial and gender identities, specifically examining the discursive representations of Black and white women in AI-generated Portuguese stories.

Method: Generated 2100 texts using LLaMA 3.2-3B, applied computational methods to group semantically similar stories, and conducted qualitative discourse analysis on selected narratives.

Result: Identified three main discursive representations: social overcoming, ancestral mythification, and subjective self-realization. Found that grammatically coherent texts materialize colonially structured framing of the female body.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that seemingly neutral AI-generated texts can reinforce historical inequalities and proposes an integrated approach combining machine learning with qualitative discourse analysis.

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

### [4] [IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02855)
*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDEAlgin is a novel benchmarking paradigm using "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgments to evaluate LLM-generated interpretive annotations against expert human ratings, showing significant improvement over traditional similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of scalable methods to evaluate whether LLM-generated interpretive annotations (like thematic analysis or educational feedback) align with expert human judgments, making it difficult to assess LLM performance in open-ended tasks.

Method: Proposed IDEAlgin - a triplet judgment task where experts identify the odd-one-out among annotations, then evaluated various similarity metrics (vector-based, topic models, embeddings, LLM-as-judge) against these human benchmarks using two educational datasets.

Result: Vector-based metrics failed to capture nuanced expert similarity judgments. LLMs prompted via IDEAlgin showed 9-30% improvement in alignment with expert judgments compared to traditional lexical and vector-based metrics.

Conclusion: IDEAlgin provides a scalable and effective paradigm for evaluating LLMs against expert annotations, supporting responsible LLM deployment in education and other domains requiring interpretive analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

### [5] [A-SEA3L-QA: A Fully Automated Self-Evolving, Adversarial Workflow for Arabic Long-Context Question-Answer Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02864)
*Kesen Wang,Daulet Toibazar,Pedro J. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-evolving adversarial workflow for Arabic long-context QA generation using specialized LVLMs that iteratively improve without human intervention, outperforming static pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance long-context comprehension capabilities of Arabic LVLMs through automated, self-improving QA generation without human supervision.

Method: Orchestrates multiple specialized LVLMs (question generator, evaluator, answer generator swarm) in closed-loop cycle with automated regeneration and model updates based on quality metrics.

Result: Substantially outperforms static pipelines, boosts long-context comprehension of leading Arabic LVLMs, and creates AraLongBench benchmark with hundreds of pages of challenges.

Conclusion: The self-evolving workflow enables continuous learning and customizable difficulty levels, significantly advancing Arabic long-context QA capabilities through fully automated processes.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

### [6] [Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908)
*Santosh Chapagain,Cory J Cascalheira,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi,Jillian R. Scheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer models with graph augmentation outperform traditional methods for detecting minority stress in online discourse, with supervised fine-tuning proving more effective than zero/few-shot approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sexual and gender minorities experience disproportionately poor health outcomes due to minority stress, but current methods for detecting this stress in online discourse need improvement.

Method: Benchmarked transformer models (ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, BART) against traditional ML baselines and graph-augmented variants, using zero-shot and few-shot learning on Reddit corpora with 12,645 and 5,789 posts over five random seeds.

Result: Graph structure integration consistently improved detection performance, supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperformed zero/few-shot approaches, and graph augmentation helped identify key linguistic markers like identity concealment and internalized stigma.

Conclusion: Graph-enhanced transformers provide the most reliable foundation for digital health interventions and public health policy by effectively detecting minority stress through social connectivity and conversational context modeling.

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

### [7] [English Pronunciation Evaluation without Complex Joint Training: LoRA Fine-tuned Speech Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02915)
*Taekyung Ahn,Hosung Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM adapted via LoRA can perform both pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection (MDD) simultaneously without complex architectural changes, achieving strong correlation with human scores and low error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an integrated pronunciation assessment system that eliminates the need for separate training procedures and complex architectural changes for simultaneous APA and MDD tasks.

Method: Fine-tuned Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on Speechocean762 dataset, focusing only on LoRA layers rather than full fine-tuning of all audio layers.

Result: Achieved strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (>0.7) with human scores, low Word Error Rate and Phoneme Error Rate (both <0.15), with LoRA-only fine-tuning performing comparably to full audio layer fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LoRA-based adaptation enables efficient integrated pronunciation assessment systems without full fine-tuning, paving the way for more accessible Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training technologies for English learners.

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

### [8] [Decoding the Rule Book: Extracting Hidden Moderation Criteria from Reddit Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02926)
*Youngwoo Kim,Himanshu Beniwal,Steven L. Johnson,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel interpretable method extracts implicit moderation criteria from historical data using lexical score tables, matching neural model performance while providing transparency into community-specific enforcement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online communities operate with diverse, implicit moderation standards that need explicit classification criteria for effective content moderation systems.

Method: Interpretable architecture that represents moderation criteria as score tables of lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic comparison across communities.

Result: Extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate neural moderation model performance while providing transparent insights, revealing significant variations in how shared norms are enforced across communities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully uncovers previously undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific language tolerances, topical restrictions, and subcategories of toxic speech classification through transparent criteria extraction.

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Susan Holm,Yuran Wang,Vincent Zhou,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMQA-Assembly: A new multimodal QA dataset for evaluating assembly task assistants, featuring 391 QA pairs combining human activity recordings and instruction manuals with semi-automated annotation using LLMs and human verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of practical testbeds for evaluating assembly task assistants in real-world settings, limiting development of procedural-activity assistance systems.

Method: Semi-automated QA annotation approach using LLMs to generate candidates and humans to verify, integrated with fine-grained action labels and instruction task graphs for toy vehicle assembly tasks.

Result: Benchmarking experiments show current multimodal models have significant room for improvement in assembly task understanding and assistance.

Conclusion: The ProMQA-Assembly dataset provides a valuable evaluation framework that can drive further development of practical assembly task assistants.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

### [10] [DiaCBT: A Long-Periodic Dialogue Corpus Guided by Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram for CBT-based Psychological Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02999)
*Yougen Zhou,Ningning Zhou,Qin Chen,Jie Zhou,Aimin Zhou,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiaCBT dataset provides long-periodic counseling dialogues with cognitive conceptualization diagrams to train LLMs for professional CBT-based psychotherapy, enhancing their ability to emulate expert psychologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health services face accessibility issues due to social stigma and therapist shortages. LLMs could expand access but lack proper psychological conversation datasets for effective psychotherapy training.

Method: Constructed a counseling dialogue corpus based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with multiple sessions per counseling case, incorporating cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across diverse scenarios.

Result: The trained in-depth counseling model demonstrated enhanced ability to emulate psychologists with CBT expertise when benchmarked against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling.

Conclusion: DiaCBT dataset effectively enhances LLMs' psychotherapeutic capabilities, showing strong potential for training more professional counseling agents and expanding mental health service accessibility.

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

*Fong-Chun Tsai,Kuan-Tang Huang,Bi-Cheng Yan,Tien-Hong Lo,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLV loss improves automated speaking assessment by addressing class imbalance through prediction perturbation, enhancing accuracy and fairness without dataset modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated Speaking Assessment models often suffer from class imbalance issues that lead to biased predictions against minority proficiency classes in second-language learners.

Method: Proposed Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss function that perturbs model predictions to improve feature representation for minority classes, integrated with BERT-based text models.

Result: Evaluation on ICNALE benchmark dataset showed significant improvements in classification accuracy and fairness metrics when BLV loss was incorporated.

Conclusion: The BLV loss effectively addresses class imbalance in automated speech assessment, making evaluation more robust and equitable for diverse language learners without requiring dataset modifications.

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

### [12] [Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020)
*Chang Su,Dengliang Shi,Siyuan Huang,Jintao Du,Changhua Meng,Yu Cheng,Weiqiang Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a new training stage to enrich final token embeddings in LLMs for better text embedding performance, achieving SOTA results on MTEB benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches use final token embeddings (like [EOS]) that weren't intentionally trained to capture whole context semantics, limiting retrieval and re-ranking performance.

Method: Adds a bidirectional generative reconstruction training stage before contrastive learning, using EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query) tasks to anchor [EOS] embeddings and reconstruct Query-Document pairs.

Result: Significantly improves LLM performance on Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Conclusion: The proposed additional training stage effectively enhances the semantic representation capacity of final token embeddings, making LLMs more effective for text embedding tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

*Ming Gong,Yingnan Deng,Nia Qi,Yujun Zou,Zhihao Xue,Yun Zi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adapter-based fine-tuning method with structure-learnable mechanism that automatically optimizes adapter insertion points and module combinations for better parameter efficiency and task adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and limited task adaptability in fine-tuning large language models.

Method: Uses differentiable gating functions and structural sparsity control variables to enable automatic optimization of adapter architecture. Keeps backbone frozen while dynamically constructing task-specific substructures.

Result: Outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks, achieving better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness to noise.

Conclusion: Proposed method significantly improves parameter utilization and representational capacity while maintaining stability and robustness across multi-task NLU settings.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

### [14] [A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model for Business Sentiment Analysis Based on Recurrent Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03060)
*Md. Jahidul Islam Razin,Md. Abdul Karim,M. F. Mridha,S M Rafiuddin,Tahira Alam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modified RNN approach using LSTM for business sentiment analysis, achieving 91.33% accuracy and outperforming conventional RNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to understand customer feedback and evaluate marketing strategies, but conventional RNN models suffer from vanishing gradient problems.

Method: Applied LSTM (a type of recurrent neural network) to prevent vanishing gradient issues, using 70% of product review data for training and 30% for testing.

Result: The proposed modified RNN model achieved 91.33% accuracy, performing better than conventional RNN models in business sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: LSTM-based modified RNN approach is effective for business sentiment analysis and can help companies identify customer preferences and improve marketing strategies based on product reviews.

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

### [15] [Measuring Scalar Constructs in Social Science with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03116)
*Hauke Licht,Rupak Sarkar,Patrick Y. Wu,Pranav Goel,Niklas Stoehr,Elliott Ash,Alexander Miserlis Hoyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can measure continuous linguistic constructs like complexity and emotionality, but direct pointwise scoring produces discontinuous distributions. Pairwise comparisons and token-probability-weighted scoring improve measurement quality, while finetuning small models with minimal data matches prompted LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are attractive for measuring scalar constructs in social science, but their numerical output treatment raises questions about optimal application methods for continuous semantic structures.

Method: Evaluated four LLM-based approaches across political science datasets: unweighted direct pointwise scoring, pairwise comparison aggregation, token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning smaller models.

Result: Direct pointwise scoring produces discontinuous distributions with arbitrary bunching. Pairwise comparisons improve quality, but token-probability-weighted scoring works even better. Finetuned small models with just 1,000 training pairs match or exceed prompted LLM performance.

Conclusion: Researchers should avoid direct pointwise scoring and instead use token-probability-weighted approaches or finetune smaller models, which can achieve comparable performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

*Yue Li,Xin Yi,Dongsheng Shi,Yongyi Cui,Gerard de Melo,Xiaoling Wang,Linlin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT) to protect LLM intellectual property by reducing fingerprint degradation during fine-tuning while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IP protection methods for LLMs through instruction tuning degrade model performance, require heavy computation, and lack persistence under model modifications. Knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative for fingerprint injection.

Method: Applies knowledge editing for fingerprint injection using scrambled text fingerprints, and proposes FSFT to constrain updates in the fingerprint subspace during fine-tuning to prevent degradation.

Result: FSFT outperforms standard fine-tuning by 10% even in worst-case scenarios. However, models struggle to distinguish fingerprints from similar texts due to feature similarity.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting injection methods for LLMs, as current approaches face challenges with feature similarity and persistence under modifications.

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

*Kaidi Lõo,Arvi Tavast,Maria Heitmeier,Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DLM-based measures predict lexical processing in Estonian, with deep learning not outperforming linear mappings, and classical predictors generally providing better fits except for total fixation duration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether computational model measures (DLM) can predict lexical processing variables and compare them to classical predictors like word frequency in Estonian.

Method: Large-scale single-subject experiment combining word naming task with eye-tracking, analyzing five response variables using generalized additive models with both linear and deep learning DLM implementations.

Result: DLM-based measures are powerful predictors; deep learning DLM not necessarily better than linear; classical predictors generally more precise except for total fixation duration; lexical variables not predictive for first fixation duration and number of fixations in naming task.

Conclusion: Meaning is heavily involved in word naming tasks as shown by DLM's predictive power for total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration through form-to-meaning mappings.

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

TL;DR: A benchmark for machine translation evaluation of six Romansh language varieties was created using human translations from WMT24++ to address limited resources for this Swiss language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Romansh language spoken in Switzerland has limited resources for machine translation evaluation, creating a need for proper benchmarks to assess translation quality.

Method: Created reference translations using human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, ensuring parallelism with over 55 other languages. Evaluated existing MT systems and LLMs.

Result: Translation out of Romansh into German works relatively well for all six varieties, but translation into Romansh remains challenging.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides valuable resources for Romansh MT evaluation, revealing that while translation from Romansh to German is effective, the reverse direction (into Romansh) still presents significant difficulties.

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five
regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our
reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++
benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An
automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores direct fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs for process mining tasks without natural language conversion, showing improved performance over traditional RNN approaches and narrative-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at token sequence generation which aligns with process mining objectives, but current approaches rely on natural language reformulation. The study aims to leverage LLMs' sequence capabilities directly on process data.

Method: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques applied to pretrained LLMs for predictive process monitoring, evaluating both single-task and multi-task prediction scenarios.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art RNN approaches and narrative-style solutions, especially in multi-task settings. They also showed faster convergence and required less hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: Direct adaptation of pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language conversion is effective and efficient, offering performance improvements and reduced computational overhead through parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

TL;DR: SinhalaMMLU is the first multiple-choice benchmark for Sinhala language, evaluating 26 LLMs and showing limited performance (best 67%) with particular struggles in culturally rich domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation focuses on global/anglocentric subjects, neglecting low-resource languages and cultural contexts. Automatic translation in multilingual benchmarks introduces errors and misrepresents cultural content.

Method: Created SinhalaMMLU benchmark with 7,000+ questions aligned with Sri Lankan curriculum, covering 6 domains and 30 subjects including culturally grounded knowledge. Evaluated 26 LLMs on this dataset.

Result: Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieved highest accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, but overall performance was limited. Models struggled significantly in culturally rich domains like Humanities.

Conclusion: LLMs need substantial improvement for low-resource languages and culturally specific contexts. Culturally grounded benchmarks are essential for proper evaluation and development of multilingual AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

TL;DR: LatPhon is a compact 7.5M-parameter Transformer model for multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion across 6 Latin-script languages, achieving 3.5% PER while being small enough for on-device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G2P conversion is crucial for speech technologies like TTS, ASR, and S2ST across multiple Latin-script languages, but existing solutions are often language-specific or too large for on-device use.

Method: Developed a 7.5M-parameter Transformer model jointly trained on six Latin-script languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian) using the ipa-dict corpus.

Result: Achieved mean phoneme error rate of 3.5%, outperforming ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while using only 30MB memory.

Conclusion: Compact multilingual G2P models like LatPhon can serve as universal front-ends for Latin-language speech pipelines with efficient on-device deployment capabilities.

Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is a key front-end for text-to-speech
(TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-speech translation (S2ST)
and alignment systems, especially across multiple Latin-script languages.We
present LatPhon, a 7.5 M - parameter Transformer jointly trained on six such
languages--English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. On the
public ipa-dict corpus, it attains a mean phoneme error rate (PER) of 3.5%,
outperforming the byte-level ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching
language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while occupying 30 MB of memory, which makes
on-device deployment feasible when needed. These results indicate that compact
multilingual G2P can serve as a universal front-end for Latin-language speech
pipelines.

*Guibin Zhang,Junhao Wang,Junjie Chen,Wangchunshu Zhou,Kun Wang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgenTracer is an automated framework for diagnosing failures in multi-agent LLM systems through counterfactual replay and fault injection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in failure attribution and enabling self-correcting agentic AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agentic systems are complex and fragile, making them prone to failures. Current reasoning LLMs perform poorly (below 10% accuracy) at identifying which agent or step causes errors in multi-agent execution traces.

Method: Proposed AgenTracer framework uses automated annotation of failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection. Developed AgenTracer-8B model trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning on the curated TracerTraj dataset.

Result: AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs (Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-4-Sonnet) by up to 18.18% on the Who&When benchmark. Delivers 4.8-14.2% performance gains to multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS through actionable feedback.

Conclusion: AgenTracer sets a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution and enables self-correcting, self-evolving agentic AI systems by providing effective failure diagnosis and actionable feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMEnt is a new analysis suite for studying how language models acquire knowledge during pretraining, featuring annotated Wikipedia corpus, improved entity retrieval, and pretrained models with checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how language models internalize world knowledge from data is crucial for developing more consistent, robust, and complete knowledge representations, but current processes are poorly understood.

Method: Developed LMEnt suite with: (1) knowledge-rich Wikipedia corpus with entity annotations, (2) entity-based retrieval method (80.4% improvement), (3) 12 pretrained models up to 1B parameters with 4K checkpoints.

Result: LMEnt provides controlled environment for analyzing entity mention connections and causal interventions. Analysis shows fact frequency is key but doesn't fully explain learning trends.

Conclusion: LMEnt enables comprehensive studies of knowledge acquisition, representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics in language models, released to support research community.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study examines pre-training mechanism in NLP transformers, finding token accuracy increases with frequency and forms clusters, with performance improving along transformer blocks and enhancing fine-tuning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms of successful pre-training in NLP models and determine the relationship between pre-training accuracy and fine-tuning performance on classification tasks.

Method: Used BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset, analyzed token accuracy patterns, confusion matrices, and fine-tuned on FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks to study pre-training effects.

Result: Token accuracy increased with frequency, formed strong match clusters along transformer blocks, improved performance toward output layer, and enhanced fine-tuning accuracy despite single-token learning objective.

Conclusion: Pre-training generates higher-order language structures and improves fine-tuning performance, with mechanisms showing universality across domains including potential application to image classification tasks.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComplexEval, a benchmark to test LLM evaluation biases in complex tasks, finding all models are significantly biased with bias increasing with task complexity, and Large Reasoning Models show paradoxical vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs handle more complex tasks, reliable evaluation becomes challenging. The LLM-as-judge paradigm needs testing for reliability in complex scenarios with nuanced criteria and unstructured references.

Method: Constructed ComplexEval benchmark to systematically expose and quantify 6 previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios.

Result: All evaluated models showed significant susceptibility to biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity. Large Reasoning Models exhibited paradoxical vulnerability despite their advanced capabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides crucial insights for improving evaluation accuracy and verifiability, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation models in complex task settings.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

TL;DR: First continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset (KAU-CSSL) with transformer-based model achieving 99.02% signer-dependent and 77.71% signer-independent accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of resources for Arabic sign languages, specifically Saudi Sign Language (SSL), where over 84,000 people depend on SSL as primary communication, facing social exclusion due to limited technological support.

Method: Created KAU-CSSL dataset with complete sentences (not isolated words) and developed transformer-based model using pretrained ResNet-18 for spatial features and Transformer Encoder with Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieved 99.02% accuracy in signer-dependent mode and 77.71% accuracy in signer-independent mode for continuous Saudi Sign Language recognition.

Conclusion: This research provides crucial resources for SSL and paves the way for improved communication tools for the deaf community in Saudi Arabia, while contributing to broader sign language technology development.

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

Conclusion: Provides novel understanding and empirical foundation for using reinforcement learning in text games, paving way for broader applications in general domains.

Abstract: As AI technology advances, research in playing text-based games with agents
has becomeprogressively popular. In this paper, a novel approach to agent
design and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement
learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and
build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based
deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to
optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game
experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoCentric-Bench, a motion-centric benchmark to evaluate video MLLMs' ability to perform pixel-level visual grounding based on motion patterns, addressing limitations in current benchmarks where static frames often suffice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video MLLMs show impressive generalization but their pixel-level visual grounding abilities, particularly regarding motion understanding, are understudied. Existing benchmarks often don't require temporal reasoning as single frames can capture motion expressions.

Method: The authors introduce four motion-centric probing techniques designed for visual grounding tasks to study whether video MLLMs can identify true motion vs fake motion and understand motion order. They create MoCentric-Bench to ensure models leverage motion-language interactions rather than static appearance cues.

Result: The paper establishes strong single-image baselines that match or outperform prior methods. They also develop simple motion-centric adaptation techniques that achieve state-of-the-art performance on their MoCentric-Bench.

Conclusion: The motion-centric benchmark, evaluation methods, and findings challenge future models to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding in videos, pushing the field beyond static appearance-based reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid multi-scale deep learning architecture combining capsule networks, graph attention, transformers, and residual learning for colon cancer classification on LC25000 dataset


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of colon cancer is crucial to prevent deterioration, requiring advanced classification methods for histopathological images

Method: HG-TNet model with transformer branch for global context and CNN branch for local details, using capsule networks to preserve spatial relationships and self-supervised rotation prediction

Result: Better performance in accuracy and loss function compared to standard architectures

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture effectively captures multi-scale features and produces robust diagnostic representations for colon cancer classification

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

TL;DR: RL-based active video acquisition framework for aortic stenosis diagnosis that dynamically selects the most informative echo videos, achieving 80.6% accuracy using only 47% of videos compared to full acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited access to echocardiography in resource-constrained areas, particularly rural and underserved regions, and the challenges of point-of-care ultrasound due to operator expertise and view selection.

Method: Reinforcement learning-driven active video acquisition framework that continuously evaluates whether additional imaging is needed and dynamically selects each patient's most informative echo videos.

Result: Achieved 80.6% classification accuracy on data from 2,572 patients while using only 47% of echo videos compared to full acquisition.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for enhancing aortic stenosis diagnosis by making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and personalized through active feature acquisition.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Method: Developed LiGuard framework with built-in support for data I/O, pre/post processing, common algorithms, interactive algorithm management, and visualization capabilities for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking tasks.

Result: The framework creates structured code files that facilitate easy sharing and reuse of projects/components, with effectiveness demonstrated through case studies.

Conclusion: LiGuard successfully addresses the challenges of code duplication and revision difficulties in lidar research by providing a flexible, reusable framework that accelerates development and promotes collaboration.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology for creating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets using digital twins to address the high cost and labor requirements of real-world data collection for ITS perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based perception systems require large labeled datasets that are costly and time-consuming to create, hindering scalability. Sim2Real learning offers an alternative but depends on simulation fidelity to real-world conditions.

Method: Proposes a rigorous workflow using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs) to replicate real-world environments, including static geometry modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario generation using open-source resources like satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data.

Result: The methodology enables creation of large-scale, high-quality synthetic datasets that provide scalable, cost-effective, and diverse data generation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Conclusion: The proposed digital twin approach provides a practical and reproducible foundation for generating synthetic datasets that can effectively support LiDAR-based perception systems in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim2Real domain transfer is cost-effective for LiDAR perception but suffers from performance degradation due to distribution shifts between synthetic and real data.

Method: Proposes a high-fidelity digital twin framework incorporating real-world background geometry, road topology, and sensor specifications to generate in-domain synthetic data for training 3D object detectors.

Result: DT-trained model outperforms real-data trained model by 4.8%, with multiple metrics (CD, MMD, EMD, FD) showing substantial reduction in domain shift at both raw-input and latent-feature levels.

Conclusion: Digital twins significantly reduce domain shift and enable reliable simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world ITS applications.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge of domain generalization in medical imaging where models trained on single sources fail under real-world distribution shifts, particularly for diabetic retinopathy classification.

Method: Integrates vision transformers with expert-guided symbolic reasoning using clinical lesion ontologies through structured rule-based features and retinal vessel segmentation, fused via confidence-weighted integration strategy. Uses KL divergence minimization between domain embeddings to enforce clinical semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves up to 5.2% accuracy gain in cross-domain settings and 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Symbolic-only model achieves 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, with lesion-based features reaching 84.65% accuracy, substantially outperforming purely neural approaches.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic integration is a promising paradigm for building clinically robust and domain-invariant medical AI systems, with symbolic components acting as effective regularizers beyond just enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSI registration methods are often complex, computationally intensive, and difficult to reproduce, while lightweight rigid frameworks suitable for consecutive-section scenarios remain underdeveloped.

Method: Integrates stain-conditioned preprocessing with hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive kernel scaling, and built-in quality control for multi-WSI alignment across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols.

Result: Achieved stable alignments within minutes per slide on ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and partial tissue overlap across multiple organs and scanning conditions.

Conclusion: STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers barriers for clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for next-generation computational pathology, though it has limitations in certain failure modes.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

TL;DR: Proposes cross-modal prompt learning and symmetric contrastive learning to address modality-missing problems in multimodal industrial surface defect detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensor availability in multimodal industrial surface defect detection, where traditional fusion methods struggle with learning mode transformation and information vacancy.

Method: Cross-modal prompt learning (consistency prompt, modality-specific prompt, missing-aware prompt) and symmetric contrastive learning using text modality as a bridge for dual vision modalities fusion with triple-modal contrastive pre-training.

Result: Achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with 0.7 total missing rate, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by 3.84% and 5.58% respectively, and outperforms existing approaches under different missing types and rates.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles modality-missing problems in industrial defect detection through innovative prompt learning and contrastive learning techniques, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet improves solar filament segmentation by integrating learnable edge maps into attention mechanisms, achieving better barb recognition and faster inference than U-Net baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture fine-scale filament structures like barbs due to limited ability to model long-range dependencies and spatial detail, which is critical for determining filament chirality and CME behavior.

Method: A U-Net based architecture that introduces a learnable edge map derived from input images, which linearly transforms attention Key and Query matrices to guide self-attention mechanisms for better boundary and barb capture.

Result: Outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based transformer baselines on MAGFILO dataset with higher segmentation accuracy, significantly better barb recognition, and faster inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Conclusion: Explicit integration of structural prior through edge-guided attention enhances spatial sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing trainable parameters, making it effective for solar filament analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models fail to effectively ground reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge for accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction in autonomous driving.

Method: Combines temporal frequency-spatial fusion video encoder with k-means + HNSW retrieval for scene-aligned exemplars, embeds retrieved priors into chain-of-thought prompts with planning constraints, and uses triple-stage fine-tuning for spatial, motion, and planning alignment.

Result: Achieves 0.70m average L2 with 0.21% collision rate (NoAvg) and 0.31m average L2 with 0.07% collision rate (TemAvg) on nuScenes dataset, with sub-millisecond retrieval latency.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs provide a data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving with complementary benefits from all fine-tuning stages.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes a dual-agent system: 1) Text-Agent with Prompt Rethink mechanism for iterative prompt refinement through LLM-diffusion collaboration, 2) Image-Agent that generates new instances conditioned on training images to enrich data distribution.

Result: Achieves +4.0 box AP and +3.3 mask AP improvements on LVIS 1.0 validation set compared to baseline, outperforms DiverGen by +0.3 box AP and +0.1 mask AP, with notable gains in common and frequent categories.

Conclusion: InstaDA provides an effective training-free solution for dataset augmentation that enhances diversity and distribution through automated dual-agent workflows, demonstrating superior performance in instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

*Chao Fan,Xibin Jia,Anqi Xiao,Hongyuan Yu,Zhenghan Yang,Dawei Yang,Hui Xu,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPENet improves few-shot medical image segmentation by generating multi-level prototypes and using query-guided enhancement to handle intra-class variations and support-query discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods use a single global prototype, which overlooks intra-class variations and struggles with substantial discrepancies between support and query images.

Method: Proposes Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet) with: 1) Multi-level Prototype Generation module for global and local prototypes, 2) Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement module to refine support prototypes using query image guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets show SPENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with superior performance.

Conclusion: SPENet effectively addresses intra-class variations and support-query discrepancies in few-shot medical image segmentation through multi-granularity prototype generation and query-guided enhancement.

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

*Chenhao Wang,Yingrui Ji,Yu Meng,Yunjian Zhang,Yao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOPSeg is a prompt-based framework for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery that addresses SAM's limitations with coarse feature resolution through region-adaptive magnification and customized decoder with edge prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object instance segmentation in remote sensing is underexplored due to technical challenges and high annotation costs, and existing models like SAM perform poorly on small objects due to coarse feature resolution.

Method: Proposed SOPSeg framework with region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve fine details, customized decoder with edge prediction and progressive refinement, and novel prompting mechanism for oriented bounding boxes.

Result: SOPSeg outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and enables efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses small object segmentation challenges in remote sensing and includes a new dataset based on SODA-A to support future research.

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

### [46] [Enhancing Robustness in Post-Processing Watermarking: An Ensemble Attack Network Using CNNs and Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03006)
*Tzuhsuan Huang,Cheng Yu Yeo,Tsai-Ling Huang,Hong-Han Shuai,Wen-Huang Cheng,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an ensemble attack network approach to enhance robustness in post-processing deep watermarking, combining CNN and Transformer networks across spatial and frequency domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-processing watermarking offers more flexibility than in-processing methods as it can be applied to outputs from any generative model without accessing internal structures and allows unique watermarks for individual images.

Method: Developed an ensemble attack network using CNN and Transformer architectures in both spatial and frequency domains during training to investigate how different combinations affect watermarking robustness.

Result: Combining CNN-based attack in spatial domain with Transformer-based attack in frequency domain yields highest robustness. On WAVES benchmark, method improves StegaStamp by 18.743% for Regeneration Attack.

Conclusion: The ensemble attack network approach significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods, particularly demonstrating substantial improvement in resisting regeneration attacks.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

Method: Integrates ResNet embeddings, Grad-CAM heatmaps, and CBAM-enhanced attention with a T5 decoder. Clinical metadata (MES score, vascular pattern, bleeding, erythema, friability, ulceration) is injected as natural-language prompts to guide caption generation.

Result: The approach improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy compared to baselines, supporting reliable endoscopic reporting with structured, interpretable descriptions.

Conclusion: The lesion-aware framework successfully generates clinically aligned captions and accurate MES classification, demonstrating potential for automated endoscopic reporting in ulcerative colitis.

Abstract: We present a lesion-aware image captioning framework for ulcerative colitis
(UC). The model integrates ResNet embeddings, Grad-CAM heatmaps, and
CBAM-enhanced attention with a T5 decoder. Clinical metadata (MES score 0-3,
vascular pattern, bleeding, erythema, friability, ulceration) is injected as
natural-language prompts to guide caption generation. The system produces
structured, interpretable descriptions aligned with clinical practice and
provides MES classification and lesion tags. Compared with baselines, our
approach improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy, supporting
reliable endoscopic reporting.

### [48] [Unveiling the Response of Large Vision-Language Models to Visually Absent Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03025)
*Sohee Kim,Soohyun Ryu,Joonhyung Park,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs often mistakenly treat text inputs as visual content. Researchers identified specific FFN neurons that detect visual absence and developed a method to refine outputs by reinterpreting prompts or replacing ungrounded tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models frequently misinterpret text inputs as being part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. The research aims to address this fundamental flaw in how LVLMs process multimodal inputs.

Method: Identified Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons in FFN layers that signal visual absence through distinctive activation patterns. Developed a detection module to classify token grounding, and used this to refine outputs by reinterpreting prompts or replacing absent tokens during generation.

Result: The method effectively mitigates models' tendency to falsely presume visual presence of text input. The approach demonstrates strong generalization across various LVLM architectures.

Conclusion: The discovered VA neurons and proposed refinement method provide an effective solution to address LVLMs' visual grounding errors, improving their reliability in multimodal understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

*Kaicong Huang,Talha Azfar,Jack M. Reilly,Thomas Guggisberg,Ruimin Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch cross-modal framework that jointly models foreground and background information for person re-identification, using intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning to enhance discriminative power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus only on foreground information and overlook background cues, while humans naturally eliminate background distractions when identifying people. Background semantics are as important as foreground semantics in ReID.

Method: End-to-end framework with dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction, intra-semantic alignment of visual and textual features with same semantics, and inter-semantic adversarial learning to penalize similarity between foreground and background features.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks show the method matches or surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of foreground and background information with cross-modal alignment and adversarial learning effectively suppresses background noise and enhances attention to identity-relevant foreground cues in person re-identification.

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedLiteNet: A lightweight CNN-Transformer hybrid for precise skin-lesion segmentation that combines hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face limitations - CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers have quadratic complexity and large parameter requirements that make them impractical for small medical datasets in dermatology.

Method: Hybrid architecture with depth-wise Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks for computation efficiency, cross-scale token-mixing unit for inter-resolution information exchange, and boundary-aware self-attention module for sharp lesion contour detection.

Result: The proposed MedLiteNet achieves high precision in dermoscopic segmentation while maintaining lightweight computational requirements suitable for medical datasets.

Conclusion: MedLiteNet effectively addresses the limitations of both CNNs and Transformers for skin-lesion segmentation, providing an optimal balance between global context modeling and computational efficiency for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

*Chengjie Huang,Jiafeng Yan,Jing Li,Lu Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm for ill-posed multi-task scenarios that decouples diffusion and condition generation, uses dynamic conditions with time-related information, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on dehazing and visible-infrared fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional conditional diffusion models struggle with exploiting intrinsic task correlations in multi-task scenarios, especially for ill-posed tasks with limited training data. Static condition control cannot adapt to dynamically evolving multi-task learning environments.

Method: Proposes a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge paradigm that: 1) decouples diffusion and condition generation processes to avoid dependence on supervised data, 2) uses dynamic conditions generated by same noise schedule to adjust statistical characteristics and embed time information, 3) analyzes network learning objectives and attention weights under different conditional forms.

Result: Achieves best performance on multiple indicators for dehazing and visible-infrared fusion tasks on public datasets. Analysis demonstrates superiority of dynamic conditions through attention weight changes and learning objective comparisons.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge framework effectively addresses challenges in ill-posed multi-task scenarios by decoupling processes and using dynamic conditions, providing a general solution for such problems with demonstrated superior performance.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Motivation: Bangla language has 50 distinct characters and many compound characters, requiring effective recognition methods for both handwritten and optical forms while avoiding vanishing gradient problems.

Method: Applied transfer learning with Deep Neural Network techniques including 3D Convolutional Neural Network, Residual Neural Network, and MobileNet for end-to-end classification of all standard Bangla handwritten character formations using the Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset (166,105 samples across 84 classes).

Result: Achieved 99.82% accuracy on training data and 99.46% accuracy on test data, demonstrating superior performance compared to various state-of-the-art benchmarks for Bangla handwritten character classification.

Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning model with 3DCNN, ResNet, and MobileNet effectively classifies both basic and compound Bangla handwritten characters with high accuracy, solving the vanishing gradient problem and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound
characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla
characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning
to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten
characters while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network
techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural
Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end
classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in
the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105
Bangla character image samples categorized into 84 distinct classes, is used
for this classification model. The model achieved 99.82% accuracy on training

TL;DR: ADA-GAN model combines GAN with external classifier to handle cursive handwritten characters using data augmentation with adversarially perturbed noise


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten characters are challenging to classify due to their complex and cursive nature compared to simple characters

Method: Generator produces fake handwritten characters, adds adversarially perturbed noise, and augments training data when confidence score exceeds threshold with discriminator

Result: CNN accuracy decreases with character complexity, but ADA-GAN remains robust and effective for both cursive and complex characters

Conclusion: ADA-GAN model demonstrates superior performance for classifying complex cursive handwritten characters compared to traditional CNNs

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

TL;DR: Cross-domain feature transfer using TRELLIS generative model improves intracranial aneurysm analysis tasks including classification, segmentation, and blood-flow prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intracranial aneurysms are clinically significant but difficult to detect and model due to limited annotated 3D medical data.

Method: Leverage latent geometric embeddings from TRELLIS (generative model trained on non-medical 3D datasets) to replace conventional features for aneurysm analysis tasks.

Result: Strong gains in accuracy, F1-score, segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines, and 15% reduction in simulation error.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative models to specialized medical applications.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader

*Shota Iwamatsu,Koichi Ito,Takafumi Aoki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A backdoor poisoning attack method that allows spoofing attacks to bypass face anti-spoofing detection by embedding spoofing features into live images without visible changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks using photos, and existing deep learning-based detection methods can be compromised if malicious data is injected into training datasets.

Method: Proposed method embeds features extracted from spoofing attack face images into live face images without causing perceptible visual alterations, creating poisoned training data.

Result: Experiments on public datasets show the method successfully enables spoofing attacks to bypass existing detection systems, demonstrating a realistic security threat.

Conclusion: The research reveals a latent threat of backdoor poisoning in face anti-spoofing detection systems, showing that certain spoofing attacks can evade detection through carefully crafted data poisoning.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net is a novel time series change detection network that infers change areas from change moments, ensuring consistency between spatial and temporal change detection results through a three-step process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches treat change area detection and change moment identification as separate tasks, despite the intrinsic relationship where change area can be inferred from change moment.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Difference Extraction and Enhancement using lightweight encoder and boundary enhancement convolution, 2) Coarse Change Moment Extraction via spatiotemporal correlation analysis, 3) Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference using multiscale temporal CAM to weight change moments and infer change areas.

Result: The proposed CAIM-Net ensures consistency between change area and change moment results by leveraging the relationship that pixels with change moments must have undergone changes.

Conclusion: CAIM-Net provides an integrated framework for time series change detection that simultaneously identifies where and when changes occur, addressing the limitation of treating spatial and temporal detection as separate tasks.

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a gradient-based self-reflection method to estimate token influence and detect visual tokens, then uses influence-aware contrastive decoding to mitigate text-visual and co-occurrence biases in multimodal LLMs without additional resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods heuristically address hallucinations caused by text-visual bias and co-occurrence bias without understanding fluctuating bias levels across instances, requiring better understanding and mitigation.

Method: Uses gradient-based self-reflection to estimate influence of different token types (visual, prompt, previous outputs), detects object-related visual tokens, and integrates them into influence-aware contrastive decoding framework.

Result: Effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90 benchmark in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates both text-visual and co-occurrence biases simultaneously without requiring additional resources like fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

*Miao Xu,Xiangyu Zhu,Xusheng Liang,Zidu Wang,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GravityDB is a diffusion-based method that simulates hand-object interactions as an attraction-driven process, resolving interpenetration issues and capturing realistic hand deformations using gravitational fields guided by semantic text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hand-object pose estimation methods suffer from interpenetration, noticeable gaps in contact regions, and inability to capture non-negligible hand surface deformations during interactions.

Method: Formulates hand-object interaction as an attraction-driven process using Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between deformable hand surfaces and rigid objects, incorporating semantic information from textual descriptions to guide gravitational field construction.

Result: Effectively resolves interpenetration issues, ensures stable grasping, captures realistic hand deformations, and enables semantically meaningful interaction regions. Validated through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GravityDB method successfully addresses limitations of previous approaches by generating physically plausible hand-object interactions free of penetration artifacts while incorporating semantic guidance for more meaningful interaction modeling.

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

*Mattia Litrico,Francesco Guarnera,Mario Valerio Giuffrida,Daniele Ravì,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D diffusion model called TADM-3D that predicts brain MRI progression using temporal guidance from a Brain-Age Estimator and bidirectional training regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRI prediction methods have limitations: they fail to capture time-structure relationships, rely on interpolation without clinical utility, and use 2D approaches that ignore 3D anatomical context needed for accurate longitudinal predictions.

Method: Proposes TADM-3D, a 3D diffusion model guided by a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator to generate MRIs reflecting expected age differences. Uses Back-In-Time Regularization (BITR) with bidirectional training (forward to follow-up and backward to baseline) to improve temporal accuracy.

Result: Trained and evaluated on OASIS-3 dataset with generalization testing on external NACC dataset. The model generates temporally accurate scans that reflect expected brain progression.

Conclusion: TADM-3D addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating 3D context, explicit time-structure modeling through BAE guidance, and bidirectional regularization for improved temporal accuracy in brain MRI progression prediction.

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

*Karol Szustakowski,Luk Frank,Julia Esser,Jan Gründemann,Marie Piraud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel loss functions for biomedical segmentation that preserve elongated structure continuity and length, improving connectivity in axon initial segment segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In biomedical segmentation tasks, preserving elongated structure continuity and length is more critical than voxel-wise accuracy, especially for applications like axon initial segments where signal dropout causes discontinuity issues.

Method: Proposed two novel loss functions: Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified Topology Loss, applied to CNNs. Also discussed experiment design characteristics like downscaling and spacing correction to obtain continuous segmentation masks.

Result: The methods reduced segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing input signal, and improved instance length calculation compared to standard CNNs and existing topology-aware losses.

Conclusion: Structural priors embedded in loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for biological applications, demonstrating the importance of connectivity preservation in biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

### [61] [Count2Density: Crowd Density Estimation without Location-level Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03170)
*Mattia Litrico,Feng Chen,Michael Pound,Sotirios A Tsaftaris,Sebastiano Battiato,Mario Valerio Giuffrida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Count2Density is a novel pipeline that generates density maps using only count-level annotations instead of detailed point-level annotations, reducing annotation burden while maintaining spatial accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crowd density estimation requires fine-grained location-level annotations which are tedious and time-consuming to collect, creating scalability barriers for real-world applications.

Method: Uses a Historical Map Bank initialized with unsupervised saliency, updated with EMA of predictions, and generates pseudo-density maps via hypergeometric sampling from count annotations. Adds self-supervised contrastive spatial regularization.

Result: Significantly outperforms cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Count2Density effectively retrieves spatial information from count-level annotations, enables accurate subregion counting, and validates the effectiveness of each pipeline component.

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

*Alma M. Liezenga,Stefan Wijnja,Puck de Haan,Niels W. T. Brink,Jip J. van Stijn,Yori Kamphuis,Klamer Schutte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates poisoning attacks on military object detection systems, creates a military vehicle dataset (MilCivVeh), tests a modified BadDet attack, finds it requires substantial data poisoning, and introduces AutoDetect - a lightweight autoencoder-based detection method that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poisoning attacks pose increasing threats to AI systems in military domains, but there's limited research on object detection system vulnerabilities. Military applications have grave consequences if compromised, making this research critical.

Method: Created custom military vehicle dataset (MilCivVeh), implemented modified BadDet patch-based poisoning attack, tested both specialized poisoning detection and anomaly detection methods, and developed AutoDetect - an autoencoder-based method using reconstruction error of image slices.

Result: Poisoning attacks achieved positive success rates but required substantial data poisoning, raising questions about practical applicability. Existing detection methods were found lacking. AutoDetect showed promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples while being less time- and memory-intensive than existing methods.

Conclusion: Large, representative military datasets are prerequisite for further evaluating poisoning risks. AutoDetect offers an effective, lightweight solution for patch detection that outperforms current methods, addressing critical security gaps in military object detection systems.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPORLD-EDNetLDCT is a reinforcement learning-based denoising method for low-dose CT that uses PPO algorithm to optimize denoising policies in real-time, achieving superior image quality metrics and improved classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT reduces radiation exposure but introduces noise and reduces image quality. Traditional denoising methods often fail to preserve image quality, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: Reinforcement learning-based approach with Encoder-Decoder architecture using PPO algorithm to optimize denoising policies in real-time based on image quality feedback, trained via custom gym environment.

Result: Achieved PSNR of 41.87, SSIM of 0.9814, RMSE of 0.00236 on low dose CT dataset; PSNR 41.52, SSIM 0.9723, RMSE 0.0051 on NIH-AAPM-Mayo dataset; improved COVID-19 classification accuracy to 94% (4% improvement over non-RL methods).

Conclusion: The method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate LDCT imaging, outperforming traditional denoising techniques and other deep learning-based methods.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Motivation: Current LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and lack ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, which hinders immersive and empathetic human-computer interactions.

Method: Proposed EmoCompanion with Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network using cross-modal fusion transformer and supervised contrastive learning, plus emotion-aware prompt engineering, TTS system, and animated avatar module.

Result: Developed a framework for emotion-aware agents that can capture multimodal sentiment cues and generate emotionally aligned responses with expressive interactions.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive framework for emotion-aware AI companions with applications in companion robotics, social care, mental health, and human-centered AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering

Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework

*Junhao Jia,Yifei Sun,Yunyou Liu,Cheng Yang,Changmiao Wang,Feiwei Qin,Yong Peng,Wenwen Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTGMFF is a novel fMRI analysis framework that combines automatic text generation from ROI data with multimodal feature fusion, achieving superior brain disorder diagnosis performance through frequency-spatial encoding and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI diagnosis faces challenges with low signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, limited frequency awareness in CNN/Transformer models, and lack of textual annotations to contextualize brain activation patterns.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) ROI-driven fMRI text generation from activation/connectivity/age/sex data, 2) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder combining wavelet-mamba branch with cross-scale Transformer, 3) Adaptive semantic alignment module with regularized cosine-similarity loss.

Result: Outperforms current methods on ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks with significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve area.

Conclusion: RTGMFF effectively addresses fMRI analysis limitations by unifying text generation with multimodal fusion, demonstrating strong potential for reliable clinical brain disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can
indicate their developmental status, but traditional fluorescence labeling

complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the
model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,
and finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and
upsampling. SROrga demonstrates satisfactory segmentation accuracy and
robustness on organoids segmentation datasets, providing a potent tool for
organoid research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynBT is a 3D medical diffusion model that generates high-quality synthetic breast tumors in MRI images using a patch-to-volume autoencoder and mask-conditioned diffusion, improving tumor segmentation performance by 2-3% Dice Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tumor synthesis methods perform poorly for large spatial volumes like breast tumors in MRI with large field-of-view, as they are typically based on small patches rather than full volumes.

Method: Proposes a 3D medical diffusion model with patch-to-volume autoencoder to compress high-resolution MRIs into latent space while preserving resolution, then uses mask-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize realistic breast tumors in selected tissue regions.

Result: The method demonstrated performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score for tumor segmentation tasks on a large public dataset compared to common segmentation models.

Conclusion: SynBT provides high-quality tumor synthesis that facilitates improved tumor segmentation in MRI images, particularly beneficial for large field-of-view applications like breast tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointAD+ transfers CLIP's 2D generalization to 3D anomaly detection using hierarchical representation learning with implicit (rendering pixel) and explicit (spatial geometry) anomaly semantics, achieving superior zero-shot performance across diverse unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects with diverse class semantics, addressing the gap in 3D anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes PointAD+ framework with hierarchical representation learning: implicit 3D representation through point-pixel correspondence (PointAD), and explicit 3D representation with G-aggregation for spatial awareness. Uses hierarchical text prompts (rendering and geometry prompts) with cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment to integrate both rendering and spatial abnormality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving holistic understanding of abnormality. Can integrate RGB information plug-and-play to further improve detection performance.

Conclusion: PointAD+ successfully transfers 2D generalization to 3D anomaly detection through a unified framework that comprehensively captures both rendering and spatial abnormalities, enabling robust performance on diverse unseen objects.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether verifiable reward-based reinforcement learning, which works well for large LLMs, is effective for lightweight multimodal language models with fewer than 7 billion parameters, and to explore the role of long Chain-of-Thought data in enhancing their reasoning abilities.

Method: Used Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long Chain-of-Thought data to enhance reasoning, followed by a reinforcement learning stage to achieve additional performance improvements.

Result: SFT with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning capabilities, and subsequent RL stage provides additional performance gains beyond the initial SFT improvements.

Conclusion: A supervised fine-tuning stage with long Chain-of-Thought data is a critical prerequisite for developing reasoning capabilities in lightweight multimodal language models.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-Transformer model for astrocyte detection in histology images, outperforming existing methods with better sensitivity and fewer false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Astrocytes' complex morphology and stain variability make automated detection challenging, which is crucial for studying neurological disorders.

Method: Combines CNN for local feature extraction with Transformer for global context. Uses heatmap-guided query mechanism for small/faint astrocytes and lightweight Transformer module for dense clusters.

Result: Outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR on ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained datasets, achieving higher sensitivity with fewer false positives in FROC analysis.

Conclusion: Hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture shows strong potential for robust astrocyte detection and provides foundation for computational pathology tools.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

*Yixiong Jing,Cheng Zhang,Haibing Wu,Guangming Wang,Olaf Wysocki,Brian Sheil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion is a zero-shot framework that converts masonry point clouds to depth maps and enhances them using diffusion models, enabling improved brick-level segmentation in low-light environments without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brick-level segmentation relies on high-resolution RGB images, which are impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds are robust to lighting but are typically unstructured and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation capabilities.

Method: Projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM) without task-specific training. The enhanced depth maps are then used with Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmentation.

Result: Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation, demonstrating enhanced visual clarity and geometric consistency of the processed depth maps.

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion provides an effective zero-shot solution for automated inspection of masonry assets in challenging low-light environments, overcoming limitations of traditional image-based approaches and raw point cloud processing.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-CAGU is a novel hyperspectral unmixing framework that combines transformer for global dependencies and content-adaptive graph neural network for local relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for hyperspectral unmixing fail to simultaneously capture global dependencies and local consistency, making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary details in remote sensing images.

Method: Proposes transformer-guided content-adaptive graph unmixing framework (T-CAGU) that uses transformer to capture global dependencies and content-adaptive graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Integrates multiple propagation orders for dynamic graph structure learning and employs graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods, showing robustness against noise and improved performance in hyperspectral unmixing tasks.

Conclusion: T-CAGU effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by simultaneously capturing global and local information, providing a robust solution for hyperspectral unmixing with better preservation of both long-range interactions and boundary details.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve strong image classification performance but suffer from high computational costs due to processing all image tokens, creating a need for efficient inference methods.

Method: A lightweight guidance model estimates token importance during inference, selectively discarding low-importance tokens before attention calculations in large ViTs. The framework is plug-and-play and requires no architectural modifications.

Result: The framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs with minimal accuracy degradation on standard image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: TinyDrop demonstrates strong generalization capability and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes D-GPTScore, a human-aligned evaluation method using MLLMs to assess concept customization by decomposing criteria into finer aspects, and releases CC-AlignBench benchmark for single/multi-concept evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for concept customization evaluation are misaligned with human preferences, providing either too narrow or too generalized assessments, especially challenging for multi-concept evaluation.

Method: Decomposed GPT Score (D-GPTScore) breaks down evaluation criteria into finer aspects and uses Multimodal Large Language Models for aspect-wise assessments. Also creates CC-AlignBench benchmark with single and multi-concept tasks.

Result: D-GPTScore significantly outperforms existing approaches on the CC-AlignBench benchmark, showing higher correlation with human preferences across various difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Establishes a new standard for evaluating concept customization and identifies key challenges for future research, providing both methodology and benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable multimodal framework for breast cancer subtyping that integrates CNV, clinical records, and histopathology images using dual-based WSI representation and novel fusion strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare applications benefit from multimodal integration but face variability in available modalities across clinical settings. Breast cancer molecular subtyping can enable personalized treatment and improved prognosis through better multimodal data integration.

Method: Proposes a scalable, loosely-coupled multimodal framework that integrates CNV, clinical records, and histopathology images. Introduces dual-based representation for WSIs combining traditional image-based and graph-based approaches, along with a new multimodal fusion strategy.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping. The dual-based WSI representation shows substantial performance improvements, and the fusion strategy enhances performance across various multimodal conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed scalable multimodal framework with dual-based WSI representation and novel fusion strategy effectively integrates diverse data sources for improved breast cancer subtyping, with potential applicability to other cancer types due to its flexible and extensible design.

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

### [77] [Time-Scaling State-Space Models for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03426)
*AJ Piergiovanni,Ganesh Satish Mallya,Dahun Kim,Anelia Angelova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes State-Space Models with Transfer State to enable online dense video captioning by scaling SSMs for longer sequences, reducing computational costs by 7x while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense video captioning methods struggle with long videos due to computational complexity and memory limitations, and require full video input which prevents online processing.

Method: Time-scaling State-Space Models (SSMs) with Transfer State mechanism that combines long-sequence and recurrent properties, allowing SSMs to sustain state for longer contexts and enabling online processing.

Result: The approach scales well with video lengths, uses 7x fewer FLOPs, and enables on-the-fly caption generation without waiting for full video processing.

Conclusion: The proposed State-Space Models with Transfer State effectively address computational limitations of traditional methods and enable practical online dense video captioning for streaming applications.

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

*Kaili sun,Xingyu Miao,Bing Zhai,Haoran Duan,Yang Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework integrating EEG, image, and text data to decode visual neural representations from low SNR EEG signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ThingsEEG dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decode visual neural representations from low signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals by leveraging text modality to enhance semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.

Method: Proposes an adapter module for cross-modal feature alignment, Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB) strategy for modality weighting, and stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) with dynamic Gaussian noise for generalization.

Result: Achieved 2.0% improvement in Top-1 accuracy and 4.7% improvement in Top-5 accuracy on ThingsEEG dataset compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework successfully integrates EEG, image, and text data with novel adaptation and regularization techniques, demonstrating superior performance in decoding visual neural representations from EEG signals.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

### [79] [Joint Training of Image Generator and Detector for Road Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03465)
*Kuan-Chuan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JTGD is a lightweight road defect detection method that jointly trains a generator and detector without ensemble or TTA, achieving state-of-the-art performance with <20% parameters of baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road defect detection is crucial for vehicle safety, but existing methods require ensemble techniques or test-time augmentation that are computationally expensive and unsuitable for edge devices with limited memory and resources.

Method: Proposes JTGD (Jointly Train Generator and Detector) with dual discriminators to enforce plausible synthesized defect patches and overall images. Uses CLIP-based Fréchet Inception Distance loss to improve image quality and jointly trains generator with detector to create harder examples for data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RDD2022 benchmark across various countries without ensemble or TTA. Uses less than 20% parameters compared to baseline, making it suitable for edge device deployment.

Conclusion: JTGD provides an efficient and lightweight solution for road defect detection that achieves superior performance while being practical for real-world deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Motivation: To enable efficient adaptation of Multimodal Large Language Models for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment without full fine-tuning, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Trains visual prompts optimized in pixel-space that are combined with images via addition, processed by frozen mPLUG-Owl2 model with textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."

Result: Achieves competitive performance across synthetic, realistic, and AI-generated distortions on KADID-10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k datasets, with 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k, comparable to full fine-tuned methods.

Conclusion: First work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, demonstrating efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks with minimal parameter updates while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

Motivation: To create a more efficient and unified multimodal model that eliminates the need for external vision components like ViT or vision tokenizers during inference, particularly for high-resolution inputs, while maintaining top performance.

Method: Uses a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with single autoregressive objective, featuring multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within LLM that reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion methods.

Result: Outperforms existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding, with significant efficiency gains especially for high-resolution inputs.

Conclusion: Pure autoregressive modeling serves as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence, demonstrating powerful potential for future multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows

TL;DR: Strefer is a synthetic instruction data generation framework that enhances Video LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities without proprietary models or human annotation, outperforming baselines on spatial and temporal disambiguation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs struggle with fine-grained spatiotemporal reasoning needed for real-world AI companions, particularly in resolving temporal references and spatial gestural cues for object positioning.

Method: A synthetic instruction data generation framework that pseudo-annotates temporally dense video metadata including subjects, objects, locations as masklets, and action descriptions/timelines in a structured manner.

Result: Models trained with Strefer-generated data outperform baselines on spatial and temporal disambiguation tasks and exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Strefer establishes a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs by enabling better spatiotemporal referring and reasoning without costly human annotation or proprietary models.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether handwriting has genetic components and is inherited, and to examine how family relationships affect handwriting styles, as no such database currently exists.

Method: Collected handwritten samples (digits, letters, shapes, free paragraphs) from 210 families including various relatives using specially designed forms, capturing all family relationships for analysis.

Result: Similarities in handwriting features and writing styles were detected among family members through comparisons and feature investigations.

Conclusion: The database provides a valuable resource for the pattern recognition community to study inheritance effects on handwriting and paves the way for further investigations into family relationship influences.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench is a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates text-to-image models' composition and reasoning capabilities through 1,080 complex prompts with high scene density and multi-step inference, revealing significant limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I benchmarks are limited in evaluating both composition and reasoning capabilities comprehensively, and they fail to handle complex prompts with high scene density and multi-step reasoning that emerging T2I models can now address.

Method: The benchmark structures composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, relation) and reasoning around philosophical inference types (deductive, inductive, abductive), creating a 12-dimensional taxonomy. Each prompt includes high compositional density and multi-step inference, paired with checklists of yes/no questions for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: Experiments with 27 T2I models show that composition capability remains limited in complex high-density scenarios, and reasoning capability is even more limited as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework that reveals significant gaps in current T2I models' abilities, particularly in reasoning and handling complex scenarios, highlighting the need for further research in these areas.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

TL;DR: Speech DF Arena is the first comprehensive benchmark for audio deepfake detection, providing standardized evaluation across 14 datasets, metrics, protocols, and a leaderboard to compare detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite significant progress in audio deepfake detection, there is a lack of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate detection systems uniformly and ensure reproducibility.

Method: The authors introduce Speech DF Arena with a toolkit for uniform evaluation across 14 diverse datasets and attack scenarios, standardized metrics and protocols, and include 12 open-source and 3 proprietary detection systems for comparison.

Result: The study reveals that many systems exhibit high Equal Error Rate (EER) in out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating the importance of extensive cross-domain evaluation for reliable detection.

Conclusion: Speech DF Arena provides a much-needed standardized benchmark that enables researchers and developers to enhance the reliability and robustness of audio deepfake detection systems through comprehensive cross-domain evaluation.

Abstract: Parallel to the development of advanced deepfake audio generation, audio
deepfake detection has also seen significant progress. However, a standardized
and comprehensive benchmark is still missing. To address this, we introduce
Speech DeepFake (DF) Arena, the first comprehensive benchmark for audio
deepfake detection. Speech DF Arena provides a toolkit to uniformly evaluate
detection systems, currently across 14 diverse datasets and attack scenarios,
standardized evaluation metrics and protocols for reproducibility and
transparency. It also includes a leaderboard to compare and rank the systems to
help researchers and developers enhance their reliability and robustness. We
include 14 evaluation sets, 12 state-of-the-art open-source and 3 proprietary
detection systems. Our study presents many systems exhibiting high EER in
out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for extensive cross-domain
evaluation. The leaderboard is hosted on Huggingface1 and a toolkit for

### [87] [Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive and Abductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03345)
*Yunxin Sun,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces InAbHyD, a synthetic dataset for evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities, finding that while LLMs can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most work on LLM reasoning focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, while inductive and abductive reasoning are essential for real-world problem solving but remain less explored.

Method: Created a programmable synthetic dataset (InAbHyD) with incomplete world models and observations, proposed a new metric based on Occam's Razor to evaluate hypothesis quality, and tested state-of-the-art LLMs with reasoning-enhancing techniques like in-context learning and RLVR.

Result: LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with advanced reasoning techniques.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in handling complex inductive and abductive reasoning tasks, indicating the need for further research and development in these reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

*Peter J. Bentley,Soo Ling Lim,Fuyuki Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bottom-up framework for AI agents that uses environmental changes to trigger behaviors and introduces "aspects" (similar to umwelt) for differentiated perception, enabling zero information leakage compared to typical architectures that leak 83% of time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic LLM AI agents are often just autonomous chatbots following scripts with unreliable control, leading to significant information leakage problems.

Method: Introduces a bottom-up framework where agents are situated in their environment with behaviors triggered by environmental changes. Uses the concept of "aspects" where different agent sets perceive environments differently for better information control.

Result: Compared to typical architectures that leak information up to 83% of the time, the aspective agentic AI framework enables zero information leakage.

Conclusion: Specialist agents working efficiently in their own information niches can provide significant improvements to both security and efficiency in AI agent systems.

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

*Zhuo Cao,Yunxiao Shi,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM-LLM is a hybrid architecture combining LLMs with kinematic models for lane change prediction, using physical parameters instead of raw coordinates to achieve interpretable and efficient trajectory forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between LLMs' contextual reasoning and physical precision of kinematic models for autonomous driving, addressing the need for interpretable and physically plausible trajectory prediction.

Method: Fine-tune an LLM to output physical parameters of an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM) including lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and longitudinal velocity change, rather than raw coordinates.

Result: Achieves 98.73% intention prediction accuracy (state-of-the-art) with 80% reduction in output size compared to coordinate-based methods, while maintaining equivalent performance to traditional LLM predictors.

Conclusion: SAM-LLM provides a complete, continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that offers significant advantages in explainability, computational efficiency, and resource efficiency for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

### [90] [Identifiability and minimality bounds of quantum and post-quantum models of classical stochastic processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03004)
*Paul M. Riechers,Thomas J. Elliott*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper resolves the identifiability problem for comparing different models (classical, quantum, or post-quantum) that generate classical stochastic processes by mapping them to a canonical generalized hidden Markov model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether different models produce the same observable behavior when generating sequences of correlated random variables, particularly in cases where quantum models offer advantages in memory and thermal efficiency over classical ones.

Method: The authors provide a means to compare any two models by mapping them to a canonical generalized hidden Markov model, which serves as a universal framework for model comparison.

Result: The approach enables comparison of classical, quantum, and post-quantum models and allows placing bounds on the minimal dimension required for a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.

Conclusion: The paper successfully resolves the identifiability problem in the quantum-classical modeling regime and provides a universal framework for model comparison with practical applications in determining minimal quantum model dimensions.

Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to
enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing
on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical
stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two
different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of
identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the
physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous
-- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to
generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem
in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical
process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them
to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to
place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum
model to generate a given classical stochastic process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable touch interaction on everyday surfaces in mixed reality without requiring instrumented surfaces, building on prior work showing physical surface interfaces outperform floating interfaces

Method: Combines computer-triggered camera and infrared emitters to create structured shadows for estimating hover distance and touch contact

Result: Achieves mean hover distance error of 6.9mm and 98.0% touch contact accuracy across various surface materials, orientations, and lighting conditions

Conclusion: The system provides accurate touch detection on uninstrumented surfaces, demonstrating robustness across different environmental conditions for mixed reality applications

Abstract: The ability to detect touch events on uninstrumented, everyday surfaces has
been a long-standing goal for mixed reality systems. Prior work has shown that
virtual interfaces bound to physical surfaces offer performance and ergonomic
benefits over tapping at interfaces floating in the air. A wide variety of
approaches have been previously developed, to which we contribute a new
headset-integrated technique called \systemname. We use a combination of a
computer-triggered camera and one or more infrared emitters to create
structured shadows, from which we can accurately estimate hover distance (mean
error of 6.9~mm) and touch contact (98.0\% accuracy). We discuss how our
technique works across a range of conditions, including surface material,
interaction orientation, and environmental lighting.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Smartphone and smartwatch with UWB can track arm pose without cameras or training data, achieving 11.0cm median error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable arm pose tracking for fitness, rehabilitation, AR input, and context-aware applications without privacy-invasive cameras or multiple wearable sensors.

Method: Leverage ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch to capture absolute distance measurements, complementing inertial data to overcome drift issues.

Result: Achieves median positional error of 11.0cm for wrist and elbow joint estimation using software-only approach on consumer devices.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical arm pose tracking using existing consumer devices with UWB, eliminating need for cameras, multiple IMUs, or user training data.

Abstract: The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of
applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life
logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not
readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry
privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we
describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to
accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of
more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture
absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect
complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We
quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf
devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \hl{median
positional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.

Conclusion: Broad domain exposure combined with targeted augmentation strategies is key to building accurate and generalizable mitotic figure classifiers for computational pathology.

Abstract: Accurate mitotic figure classification is crucial in computational pathology,
as mitotic activity informs cancer grading and patient prognosis.
Distinguishing atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), which indicate higher tumor
aggressiveness, from normal mitotic figures (NMFs) remains challenging due to
subtle morphological differences and high intra-class variability. This task is
further complicated by domain shifts, including variations in organ, tissue
type, and scanner, as well as limited annotations and severe class imbalance.
To address these challenges in Track 2 of the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, we propose
a solution based on the lightweight ConvNeXt architecture, trained on all
available datasets (AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD, and OMG-Octo) to maximize
domain coverage. Robustness is enhanced through a histopathology-specific
augmentation pipeline, including elastic and stain-specific transformations,
and balanced sampling to mitigate class imbalance. A grouped 5-fold
cross-validation strategy ensures reliable evaluation. On the preliminary
leaderboard, our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961, ranking among
the top entries. These results highlight that broad domain exposure combined
with targeted augmentation strategies is key to building accurate and
generalizable mitotic figure classifiers.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach combining nnUNetV2 with random forest classifiers using multiple CNN architectures proved effective for both mitosis detection and atypical classification tasks in the MIDOG challenge.

Abstract: This abstract presents our solution (Team Westwood) for mitosis detection and
atypical mitosis classification in the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
2025 challenge. For mitosis detection, we trained an nnUNetV2 for initial
mitosis candidate screening with high sensitivity, followed by a random forest
classifier ensembling predictions of three convolutional neural networks
(CNNs): EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and EfficientNetV2-s. For the
atypical mitosis classification, we trained another random forest classifier
ensembling the predictions of three CNNs: EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and
InceptionV3. On the preliminary test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of
0.7450 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8722 for
track 2 atypical mitosis classification.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces atypical mitosis classification using ConvNeXt and Lunit ViT backbones, achieving ~95% AUROC with no consistent benefit from synthetic data balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the clinically relevant but highly imbalanced problem of distinguishing normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images across domains.

Method: Used two backbones: ImageNet-pretrained ConvNeXt-Small and self-supervised Lunit ViT. Applied synthetic data balancing and five-fold cross-validation to handle class imbalance (9408 normal vs 1741 atypical).

Result: Both models achieved strong performance (~95% mean AUROC). ConvNeXt reached higher peaks while Lunit showed better stability. Synthetic balancing provided no consistent improvements. ConvNeXt achieved 95.4% AUROC on OOD test set.

Conclusion: Both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining offering robustness and ImageNet pretraining achieving higher peaks. Naive synthetic balancing has limited benefit.

Abstract: The MIDOG 2025 challenge extends prior work on mitotic figure detection by
introducing a new Track 2 on atypical mitosis classification. This task aims to
distinguish normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a
clinically relevant but highly imbalanced and cross-domain problem. We
investigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on
ImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via
self-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.
1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate
class balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic
data. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong
performance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving
slightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability.
Synthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the
organizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an
out-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4
percent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These
findings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable
for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring
robustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive
synthetic balancing has limited benefit. Full hidden test set results will be
reported upon challenge completion.

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection remains a challenging task in computational
pathology due to domain variability and morphological complexity. This paper
describes our participation in the MIDOG 2025 challenge, focusing on robust
mitotic figure detection across diverse tissue domains. We developed a
two-stage pipeline combining Faster R-CNN for candidate detection with an
ensemble of three classifiers (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-v2,
InceptionResNet-v2) for false positive reduction. Our best submission achieved
F1-score 0.2237 (Recall: 0.9528, Precision: 0.1267) using a Faster R-CNN
trained solely on MIDOG++ dataset. While our high recall demonstrates effective
mitotic figure detection, the critically low precision (12.67%) reveals
fundamental challenges in distinguishing true mitoses from morphologically
similar imposters across diverse domains. Analysis of six submission variants
showed that subsequent optimization attempts were counterproductive,
highlighting the omplexity of domain generalization in histopathology. This
work provides valuable insights into the practical challenges of developing
robust mitotic figure detection algorithms and emphasizes the importance of
effective false positive suppression strategies.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are clinically relevant indicators of
abnormal cell division, yet their reliable detection remains challenging due to
morphological ambiguity and scanner variability. In this work, we investigated
three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2-h for the

Result: YOLOv5 achieved superior precision while YOLOv8 provided improved recall. The ensemble approach enhanced sensitivity without major reduction in precision, demonstrating improved performance over individual models.

Conclusion: Ensemble strategies built upon contemporary object detectors effectively advance automated mitosis detection in digital pathology by leveraging complementary strengths of different architectures.

Abstract: Accurate detection of mitotic figures in whole slide histopathological images
remains a challenging task due to their scarcity, morphological heterogeneity,
and the variability introduced by tissue preparation and staining protocols.
The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating
detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of
generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the
performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on
MIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated
stain-invariant color perturbations and texture preserving augmentations. In
internal validation, YOLOv5 achieved superior precision, while YOLOv8 provided
improved recall, reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and
anchor-free detection. To capitalize on these complementary strengths, we
employed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity without a
major reduction in precision. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
ensemble strategies built upon contemporary object detectors to advance
automated mitosis detection in digital pathology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Novel Deep Self-knowledge Distillation method for coronary artery segmentation that uses hierarchical outputs and dual loss functions to improve performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual coronary artery segmentation from X-ray angiography is time-consuming, and existing automated methods suffer from poor performance and limited generalizability. Current knowledge distillation approaches fail to fully exploit hierarchical model knowledge.

Method: Deep Self-knowledge Distillation combining Deep Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, using hierarchical outputs for supervision with dual regularization (loosely constrained probabilistic distribution and tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision).

Result: Outperforms other models on XCAD and DCA1 datasets in dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity, and IoU metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical knowledge distillation approach effectively transfers knowledge from teacher to student models, enhancing segmentation performance, generalization, and robustness for coronary artery segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the
critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual
coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and
inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing
methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like
poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge
distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the
hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and
insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for
segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep
Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation
that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep
Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method
enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical
learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model.
Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector
with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization
for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and
robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU
compared to other models in comparative evaluations.

TL;DR: A unified framework combining variational reconstruction, supervised segmentation, and adversarial feedback for small abdominal organ segmentation in CT imaging, addressing class imbalance and limited data through hybrid generative-discriminative training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in segmenting small, irregularly shaped abdominal organs like adrenal glands in CT imaging, which suffer from severe class imbalance, poor spatial context, and limited annotated data.

Method: VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates segmentation masks, with patch-based training using synthetic patches from learned latent space, perceptual reconstruction loss with VGG features, and PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial supervision.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on BTCV dataset show improved segmentation accuracy, particularly in boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Hybrid generative-discriminative training is effective for small-organ segmentation, providing insights into balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Segmentation of small and irregularly shaped abdominal organs, such as the
adrenal glands in CT imaging, remains a persistent challenge due to severe
class imbalance, poor spatial context, and limited annotated data. In this
work, we propose a unified framework that combines variational reconstruction,
supervised segmentation, and adversarial patch-based feedback to address these
limitations in a principled and scalable manner. Our architecture is built upon
a VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates
voxel-level segmentation masks, allowing the model to learn disentangled
representations of anatomical structure and appearance. We introduce a
patch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches
generated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects
of varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance
output fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss
using VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial
supervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset
demonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in
boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative
training regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into
balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce
scenarios.

TL;DR: Generalist foundation models like DINOv2/v3 show strong adaptability in retinal applications, but specialist RETFound-DINOv2 still outperforms them in ocular disease detection and oculomics tasks with better generalization and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether domain-specific pre-training remains essential given the emergence of increasingly powerful generalist foundation models, and to identify what performance gap persists between specialist and generalist models in retinal image applications.

Method: Systematic evaluation comparing DINOv2 and DINOv3 generalist models against two specialist RETFound models (RETFound-MAE and RETFound-DINOv2) on ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction using fine-tuning and linear probing adaptation strategies. Analyzed data efficiency and adaptation efficiency.

Result: Specialist RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperformed generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics tasks, demonstrating stronger generalizability and data efficiency, though generalist models showed strong adaptability across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Specialist retinal foundation models remain the most effective choice for clinical applications, but the narrowing gap with generalist models suggests continued data and model scaling can deliver domain-relevant gains, positioning them as strong foundations for future medical foundation models.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data,
demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications.
RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this
approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of
increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as
DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training
remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image
applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and
RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and
systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and
linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed
to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational
cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong
adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms
these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics
tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These
findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most
effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with
generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can
deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for
future medical foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage quantum computing for enhanced computational efficiency in medical imaging applications, specifically for brain tumor classification using MRI images.

Method: Used QCNN model with quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers (filter size 2, depth 4, 4 qubits) trained over 10 epochs on 3,264 MRI images with 80/20 train/test split and oversampling for class imbalance.

Result: Binary classification achieved 88% accuracy (improved to 89% after balancing), multiclass classification achieved 52% accuracy (improved to 62% after oversampling).

Conclusion: QCNNs show promise for medical imaging, particularly binary classification, but need optimized quantum circuits and hybrid classical-quantum approaches for better multiclass performance and clinical applicability.

Abstract: This study explores the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks
(QCNNs) for brain tumor classification using MRI images, leveraging quantum
computing for enhanced computational efficiency. A dataset of 3,264 MRI images,
including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was
utilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an
oversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model
consists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with
a filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two
models were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor
presence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The
binary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing,
while the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after
oversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass
model faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit
limitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging
applications, particularly in binary classification. However, further
refinements, including optimized quantum circuit architectures and hybrid
classical-quantum approaches, are necessary to enhance multiclass
classification accuracy and improve QCNN applicability in clinical settings.

Conclusion: Combining foundation model embeddings with advanced classification strategies like KAN enables building robust and generalizable breast MRI analysis tools with both performance and interpretability benefits.

Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis,
especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that
adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for
breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust
per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold
Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable
alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized
nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the
model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced
and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80
\pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress toward general intelligence requires foundation models that can handle structured data (tables) alongside language and physical world data, addressing the gap in current AI systems' ability to work with tabular information.

Method: Pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with episodic, context-conditional objective. The model predicts query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, enabling training-free adaptation at inference without task-specific architectures.

Result: LimiX consistently outperforms strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, and recent tabular foundation models across 10 benchmarks with varying data characteristics (sample size, dimensionality, missingness, etc.).

Conclusion: LimiX demonstrates superior performance across diverse tabular tasks with a unified approach, avoiding task-specific customization while being publicly available under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of missing modalities and limited labeled data in multimodal learning, which are critical for developing robust real-world applications.

Method: Uses a novel information-theoretic approach with two core objectives: soft Positive-Unlabeled contrastive loss for task-relevant feature alignment, and latent reconstruction loss to preserve modality-specific information within a modular design.

Result: Superior performance over existing approaches across diverse datasets in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts, with lightweight scalable design.

Conclusion: Robult provides an effective solution for robust multimodal learning that is scalable, resilient to incomplete modalities, and easily integrable with existing architectures for real-world applications.

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

### [116] [Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073)
*Rui Shao,Wei Li,Lingsen Zhang,Renshan Zhang,Zhiyang Liu,Ran Chen,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This survey provides the first systematic review of large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation, categorizing them into monolithic and hierarchical architectures, analyzing integration with advanced domains, and identifying future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based robotic manipulation methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured environments, creating a need for more advanced approaches using large vision-language models.

Method: The survey systematically reviews VLA models by defining architectural paradigms (monolithic vs hierarchical), examining integration with reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, human video learning, and world models, and synthesizing characteristics and datasets.

Result: The survey consolidates recent advances, resolves inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigates research fragmentation, and provides a systematic integration framework for VLA models in robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: Large VLM-based VLA models represent a transformative paradigm for robotic manipulation, with promising future directions including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, and multi-agent cooperation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires
precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based
methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In
recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have
emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first
systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic
manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and
delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,
encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of
integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning
from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this
foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:
(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,
training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model
integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating
architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks
that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,
including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent
cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent
advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research
fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of
studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide
a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:

### [117] [DUViN: Diffusion-Based Underwater Visual Navigation via Knowledge-Transferred Depth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02983)
*Jinghe Yang,Minh-Quan Le,Mingming Gong,Ye Pu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DUViN is a diffusion-based visual navigation system for underwater vehicles that uses knowledge-transferred depth features to enable 4-DoF motion control without pre-built maps, overcoming domain shift challenges from in-air to underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous underwater navigation is challenging due to limited sensing and difficulty in constructing accurate underwater maps. There's also a lack of large-scale underwater navigation datasets for training.

Method: Two-phase training: 1) Train diffusion-based navigation policy on in-air datasets using pre-trained depth feature extractor; 2) Retrain extractor on underwater depth estimation and integrate into trained navigation policy. Uses depth features for domain adaptation.

Result: Experiments in both simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate effective obstacle avoidance, safe altitude maintenance, and robust generalization under domain shifts.

Conclusion: DUViN provides an effective vision-based end-to-end navigation solution for underwater vehicles in unknown environments, successfully addressing the domain transfer challenge from in-air to underwater settings.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

### [118] [Uncertainty-aware Test-Time Training (UT$^3$) for Efficient On-the-fly Domain Adaptive Dense Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03012)
*Uddeshya Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UT³ framework reduces inference time for test-time training in autonomous systems by using uncertainty-aware self-supervision to selectively apply training only when needed, maintaining performance while significantly improving latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with domain shift in real-world autonomous systems, and existing test-time training methods increase inference time too much for resource-constrained hardware with latency requirements.

Method: Proposes UT³ framework with uncertainty-aware self-supervision task that uses quantified uncertainty to selectively apply test-time training, allowing users to control training frequency through keyframe selection.

Result: Significantly reduces inference time while performing comparably to standard test-time training, demonstrated on monocular depth estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient solution for real-world robotics applications by balancing adaptation performance with inference latency through selective uncertainty-based training.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

### [119] [Efficient Active Training for Deep LiDAR Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03211)
*Beibei Zhou,Zhiyuan Zhang,Zhenbo Song,Jianhui Guo,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Active training framework for LiDAR odometry that selectively extracts training data from diverse environments, reducing training load by 48% while maintaining full-dataset performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep LiDAR odometry models require extensive and diverse training data to adapt to different environments, leading to inefficiencies in training and deployment.

Method: Two-stage approach: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) analyzes motion sequences to create diverse initial dataset, and Active Incremental Selection (AIS) uses scene reconstruction and prediction inconsistency to iteratively select challenging samples, especially for complex snowy conditions.

Result: Achieves same performance as full-dataset training with only 52% of sequence volume, demonstrating high training efficiency and robustness across diverse weather conditions and datasets.

Conclusion: The active training paradigm enables more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems that can navigate diverse environmental conditions with greater precision and reduced training overhead.

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

### [120] [SESGO: Spanish Evaluation of Stereotypical Generative Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03329)
*Melissa Robles,Catalina Bernal,Denniss Raigoso,Mateo Dulce Rubio*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: First systematic evaluation of bias in Spanish-language LLMs within Latin American cultural contexts, revealing that English-optimized bias mitigation doesn't transfer effectively and bias patterns persist across temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual LLMs, as current evaluations are predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts underexamined.

Method: Introduce a culturally-grounded framework adapting the underspecified question methodology from BBQ dataset, incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings across four social categories (gender, race, socioeconomic class, national origin) with over 4,000 prompts.

Result: Reveal varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art commercial LLMs in Spanish, show bias mitigation techniques optimized for English don't effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and demonstrate bias patterns remain consistent across different sampling temperatures.

Conclusion: The modular framework represents a significant step toward more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in diverse linguistic environments, with natural extension capabilities to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual
Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within
culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment,
current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential
harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We
introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in
instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question
methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific
expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social
categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more
than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the
direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment
in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work
presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs
respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying
patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also
contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do
not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain
largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular
framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or
languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more
equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse
linguistic environments where they operate.
