The second dataset\npresents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence\nintensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning\nhas shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often\ndeclines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we\ndeveloped a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation\nResidual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by\nintegrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms\nin the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and\nquantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,\nnamely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures.
