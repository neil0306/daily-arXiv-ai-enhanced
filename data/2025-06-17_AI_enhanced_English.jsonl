Detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias\nin LLMs has therefore become a critical research focus. In the NLPCC 2025\nShared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and\nMitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in\ngender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement\nlearning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to\nhandle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the\ninternal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a\nstaged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response\naccuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach,\nannotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that\nexplicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones.

In\nour paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a\nsemantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to\nencode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without\npredefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,\nwhich accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a\ncomplete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their\nrelations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or\npredefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate\nsemantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged\nsuperpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency.

However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks\neven after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety\nguardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial\njailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial\ntraining and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but\nthese methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant\ncomputational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose\nSecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against\njailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we\ntrain a prompt compressor designed to discern the \"true intention\" of the input\nprompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of\nadversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is\npassed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true\nintention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience\nby leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's\npotentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails\nof the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only\na negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense\nmethods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend\nagainst malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible\ncompute and latency overhead.

In this paper, we propose\ncontext-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that\ninitializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our\nmethod enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)\nand instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between\nfreezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or\nadapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin.
