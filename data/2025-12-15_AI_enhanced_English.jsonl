Through causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning, CIP suppresses non causal reasoning paths, improving factual grounding and interpretability. Experiments across seven mainstream language models, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 3.1, show that CIP consistently enhances reasoning quality and reliability, achieving 2.6 points improvement in Attributable Rate, 0.38 improvement in Causal Consistency Score, and a fourfold increase in effective information density.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space.

To avoid the significant memory consumption and limited generalizability brought by building separate models per class, we focus on developing a unified framework for multi-class anomaly detection. However, under this challenging setting, conventional reconstruction-based networks often suffer from an identity mapping problem, where they directly replicate input features regardless of whether they are normal or anomalous, resulting in detection failures. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel framework termed Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair (CRR), which transforms the reconstruction to repairation. First, we optimize the decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing synthesized anomalies. Consequently, it generates distinct representations for anomalous regions and similar representations for normal areas compared to the encoder's output.

Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation.

However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection.

Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs.

Although many devices include specialized accelerators (e.g., mobile GPUs), dynamic control-flow operators and unsupported kernels often fall back to CPU execution.

We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models.

Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series.

Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection.
