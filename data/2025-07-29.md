### [1] [Advancing Mental Disorder Detection: A Comparative Evaluation of Transformer and LSTM Architectures on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19511)
*Khalid Hasan,Jamil Saquer,Mukulika Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) and LSTM for mental health disorder classification on Reddit, finding transformers superior, with RoBERTa achieving the highest F1 scores. LSTM with BERT embeddings also performed well with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders requires automated tools for early detection, leveraging NLP advancements.

Method: Comparison of transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) and LSTM with various embeddings on a large annotated Reddit dataset, validated via statistical and topic modeling.

Result: Transformers outperformed LSTM; RoBERTa achieved 99.54% F1 (hold-out) and 96.05% (external). LSTM with BERT embeddings was competitive (94% F1) with lower resource use.

Conclusion: Transformer models are effective for scalable mental health monitoring, with implications for clinical applications and digital interventions.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

### [2] [Setting The Table with Intent: Intent-aware Schema Generation and Editing for Literature Review Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19521)
*Vishakh Padmakumar,Joseph Chee Chang,Kyle Lo,Doug Downey,Aakanksha Naik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses ambiguity and lack of refinement in schema generation for academic literature using LLMs, introducing a dataset with synthesized intents and editing techniques to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to organize and compare academic documents efficiently, hindered by ambiguity in evaluations and lack of refinement methods for schema generation.

Method: Augments unannotated table corpora with synthesized intents to create a dataset, benchmarks single-shot schema generation methods, and proposes LLM-based editing techniques.

Result: Incorporating table intents improves baseline schema reconstruction, and editing techniques enhance schemas generated by fine-tuned or prompted LLMs.

Conclusion: The work advances schema generation by addressing key challenges, showing smaller models can compete with state-of-the-art LLMs when fine-tuned and edited.

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WOKIE is an open-source pipeline for automated SKOS thesaurus translation, combining external services and LLMs to improve accessibility and interoperability in Digital Humanities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses language diversity barriers in DH by enabling automated, scalable, and cost-effective thesaurus translation.

Method: Uses external translation services and LLMs for refinement, designed for everyday hardware and ease of extension.

Result: Evaluated across 15 languages, WOKIE improves translation quality, performance, and ontology matching.

Conclusion: WOKIE enhances thesauri accessibility and multilingual interoperability, supporting inclusive research infrastructures.

Abstract: We introduce WOKIE, an open-source, modular, and ready-to-use pipeline for
the automated translation of SKOS thesauri. This work addresses a critical need
in the Digital Humanities (DH), where language diversity can limit access,
reuse, and semantic interoperability of knowledge resources. WOKIE combines
external translation services with targeted refinement using Large Language
Models (LLMs), balancing translation quality, scalability, and cost. Designed
to run on everyday hardware and be easily extended, the application requires no
prior expertise in machine translation or LLMs. We evaluate WOKIE across
several DH thesauri in 15 languages with different parameters, translation
services and LLMs, systematically analysing translation quality, performance,
and ontology matching improvements. Our results show that WOKIE is suitable to
enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

### [4] [Mitigating Geospatial Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models: Benchmarking and Dynamic Factuality Aligning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19586)
*Shengyuan Wang,Jie Feng,Tianhui Liu,Dan Pei,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses geospatial hallucinations in LLMs, proposing an evaluation framework and a mitigation method (KTO-based) to improve accuracy by 29.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to unreliable outputs, yet systematic evaluation and mitigation of such geospatial hallucinations are underexplored.

Method: A comprehensive evaluation framework using geospatial knowledge graphs is introduced, followed by a dynamic factuality aligning method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO).

Result: Evaluation of 20 LLMs revealed geospatial hallucinations, and the KTO-based method improved performance by 29.6%.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and learning algorithm effectively enhance LLM trustworthiness in geospatial tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19595)
*Yutao Sun,Zhenyu Li,Yike Zhang,Tengyu Pan,Bowen Dong,Yuyi Guo,Jianyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey on efficient attention mechanisms in Transformer-based models, addressing quadratic complexity issues through linear and sparse attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention in Transformers hinders efficient long-context modeling, prompting research into scalable alternatives.

Method: Two main approaches: linear attention (kernel approximations, recurrent formulations) and sparse attention (fixed patterns, block-wise routing, clustering).

Result: Systematic overview of algorithmic innovations and hardware considerations, with integration into large-scale pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Aims to guide scalable and efficient language model design by bridging theory and practical deployment.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

### [6] [MOCHA: Are Code Language Models Robust Against Multi-Turn Malicious Coding Prompts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19598)
*Muntasir Wahed,Xiaona Zhou,Kiet A. Nguyen,Tianjiao Yu,Nirav Diwan,Gang Wang,Dilek Hakkani-T√ºr,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces code decomposition attacks to test LLMs' robustness against multi-turn malicious prompts and proposes a benchmark, MOCHA, to evaluate and improve model resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored vulnerabilities in LLMs' code generation, particularly against adversarial misuse via multi-turn prompts.

Method: Introduces code decomposition attacks and the MOCHA benchmark for evaluating model robustness. Fine-tunes models on MOCHA to enhance rejection rates.

Result: Empirical results show persistent vulnerabilities, especially in multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning improves rejection rates by up to 32.4%.

Conclusion: MOCHA enhances LLM robustness against adversarial coding prompts without additional supervision, preserving coding ability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

### [7] [HITSZ's End-To-End Speech Translation Systems Combining Sequence-to-Sequence Auto Speech Recognition Model and Indic Large Language Model for IWSLT 2025 in Indic Track](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19616)
*Xuchen Wei,Yangxin Wu,Yaoyin Zhang,Henglyu Liu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HITSZ's IWSLT 2025 submission combines Whisper ASR and Krutrim LLM for English-Indic ST translation, achieving BLEU scores of 28.88 and 27.86. CoT method showed promise but faced consistency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address low-resource challenges in English-Indic speech-to-text translation by leveraging pre-trained models.

Method: End-to-end system integrating Whisper ASR and Krutrim LLM, with exploration of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method.

Result: Average BLEU scores of 28.88 (English-to-Indic) and 27.86 (Indic-to-English). CoT improved Tamil-to-English by 13.84 BLEU but faced format adherence issues.

Conclusion: The integrated system performs well, and CoT shows potential but requires refinement for consistent output formatting.

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

### [8] [MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19634)
*Sara Papi,Maike Z√ºfle,Marco Gaido,Beatrice Savoldi,Danni Liu,Ioannis Douros,Luisa Bentivogli,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCIF is a new multilingual, multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs across languages and modalities with human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of multilingual and multimodal capabilities in MLLMs, limiting progress.

Method: Introduces MCIF, a benchmark based on scientific talks, covering speech, vision, and text in four languages.

Result: MCIF enables thorough assessment of MLLMs' instruction-following abilities in crosslingual, multimodal contexts.

Conclusion: MCIF fills gaps in current benchmarks, promoting open research and advancement in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

### [9] [RoD-TAL: A Benchmark for Answering Questions in Romanian Driving License Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19666)
*Andrei Vlad Man,RƒÉzvan-Alexandru SmƒÉdu,Cristian-George Craciun,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel,Florin Pop,Mihaela-Claudia Cercel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs and VLMs for Romanian driving law tasks, introduces the RoD-TAL dataset, and shows fine-tuning improves performance, though visual reasoning remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for AI tools in legal education for under-resourced languages like Romanian, focusing on driving law.

Method: Uses RoD-TAL dataset for multimodal tasks, implements RAG pipelines, dense retrievers, and reasoning models for IR, QA, Visual IR, and Visual QA.

Result: Domain-specific fine-tuning boosts retrieval; reasoning models improve QA accuracy, exceeding exam passing grades. Visual reasoning is still difficult.

Conclusion: LLMs and VLMs show promise for legal education but face limitations in visual reasoning.

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

### [10] [Towards Inclusive NLP: Assessing Compressed Multilingual Transformers across Diverse Language Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19699)
*Maitha Alshehhi,Ahmed Sharshar,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benchmarking multilingual and monolingual LLMs in low-resource languages reveals multilingual models outperform monolingual ones, with quantization maintaining accuracy but pruning harming performance, especially in larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM performance in low-resource languages (e.g., Kannada, Arabic) and evaluate the impact of model compression (pruning, quantization).

Method: Benchmarked multilingual and monolingual LLMs (e.g., BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2) across Arabic, English, and Indic languages, focusing on compression effects.

Result: Multilingual models outperform monolingual ones; quantization (4-bit, 8-bit) preserves accuracy, but pruning degrades performance, especially in larger models.

Conclusion: Key strategies for scalable multilingual NLP include leveraging cross-lingual transfer and cautious use of compression, while addressing hallucination and generalization in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

### [11] [Ta-G-T: Subjectivity Capture in Table to Text Generation via RDF Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19710)
*Ronak Upasham,Tathagata Dey,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pipeline for Table-to-Text (T2T) generation that combines objective and subjective text by leveraging intermediate RDF triples, outperforming large language models like GPT-3.5 in some metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2T approaches focus on objective descriptions, leaving subjective interpretations underexplored. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: 1) RDF triple extraction, 2) text aggregation into narratives, and 3) subjectivity infusion. Uses fine-tuned T5 models instead of large LLMs.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to GPT-3.5 and outperforms Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in some metrics, balancing factual accuracy with subjectivity.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is the first to integrate intermediate representations for enhancing both factual correctness and subjectivity in T2T generation.

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

### [12] [Basic Reading Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19741)
*Zhi Zhou,Sirui Miao,Xiangyu Duan,Hao Yang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Basic Reading Distillation (BRD) to train small models by imitating LLMs' basic reading behaviors, improving performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational demands of LLMs by distilling their basic reading behaviors into smaller models, which current distillation methods overlook.

Method: Propose BRD, educating small models to imitate LLMs' basic reading behaviors (e.g., named entity recognition, Q&A) on generic texts.

Result: The small model outperforms or matches 20x larger LLMs on tasks like language inference and BIG-bench.

Conclusion: BRD effectively influences small models' probability distributions and complements existing distillation techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JT-Math-8B is an open-source model series designed for advanced mathematical reasoning, outperforming competitors like GPT-4o through multi-stage optimization and a high-quality dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current LLMs in complex mathematical reasoning by developing specialized models.

Method: Uses a multi-stage framework: base model, Instruct Model (SFT + GRPO RL), and Thinking Model (Long CoT + multi-stage RL). Pre-trained on a 210B-token dataset with model-based validation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing GPT-4o in competition-level mathematics.

Conclusion: JT-Math-8B demonstrates the effectiveness of specialized training and high-quality data for advancing mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length
up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among
open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's
O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on
competition-level mathematics.

### [14] [Are You There God? Lightweight Narrative Annotation of Christian Fiction with LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19756)
*Rebecca M. M. Hicke,Brian Haggard,Mia Ferrante,Rayhan Khanna,David Mimno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses computational tools to analyze Christian Fiction, focusing on divine acts, revealing differences between the Left Behind series, broader Christian Fiction, and works by male vs. female authors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the understudied cultural and literary side of the American Evangelical movement, particularly Christian Fiction, and how divine acts are depicted.

Method: Developed definitions and a codebook for 'acts of God' with human annotators, adapted for a lightweight LM with a larger model's help, and compared annotations.

Result: The lightweight LM matched human annotations, revealing significant differences between the Left Behind series, broader Christian Fiction, and gender-based author differences.

Conclusion: Computational tools can effectively analyze nuanced literary themes, uncovering meaningful distinctions in Christian Fiction.

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

### [15] [UloRL:An Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning Approach for Advancing Large Language Models' Reasoning Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19766)
*Dong Du,Shulin Liu,Tao Yang,Shaohua Chen,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning by segmenting long outputs and using dynamic masking, achieving faster training and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL struggles with ultra-long outputs due to inefficiencies and entropy collapse, limiting LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Divides output into short segments for efficient training and introduces dynamic masking of well-mastered tokens to prevent entropy collapse.

Result: Achieves 2.06x faster training and significant performance gains (e.g., AIME2025: 70.9% to 85.1%).

Conclusion: UloRL effectively advances LLMs' reasoning with ultra-long sequences, with code and model to be released.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

*Tianxiang Chen,Zhentao Tan,Xiaofan Bo,Yue Wu,Tao Gong,Qi Chu,Jieping Ye,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flora introduces a human/LLM-free strategy to enhance long-context performance in LLMs by assembling short instructions, maintaining short-context abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like rarity of long texts, computational demands, and forgetting short-context abilities in LLMs.

Method: Flora constructs long contexts by assembling short instructions based on categories and using meta-instructions for responses.

Result: Enhanced long-context performance in benchmarks (Llama3-8B-Instruct, QwQ-32B) with minimal impact on short-context tasks.

Conclusion: Flora provides a scalable, diverse, and cost-effective solution for improving long-context LLM performance.

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

### [17] [HCAttention: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Heterogeneous Attention Computing for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19823)
*Dongquan Yang,Yifan Yang,Xiaotian Yu,Xianbiao Qi,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCAttention is a framework for efficient long-context inference in LLMs, reducing KV cache memory to 25% of original size without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high memory demands of KV cache in LLMs, especially under extreme constraints, and improving GPU-CPU collaboration for attention computation.

Method: Combines key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction, requiring no model fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves accuracy of full-attention models with 25% KV cache memory, and remains competitive at 12.5%. Extends Llama-3-8B to process 4M tokens on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: HCAttention sets a new SOTA in KV cache compression, enabling efficient long-context processing without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

*Anshul Chavda,M Jagadeesh,Chintalapalli Raja Kullayappa,B Jayaprakash,Medchalimi Sruthi,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiscoDrive is a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn dialogs with disfluencies, improving conversational AI performance in in-car settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack real-world disfluencies in driver-AI dialogs, limiting AI robustness.

Method: A two-stage, prompt-driven pipeline dynamically integrates disfluencies during dialog synthesis.

Result: DiscoDrive outperforms KVRET-trained models on metrics like BLEU-4, METEOR, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: DiscoDrive effectively bridges the gap in resources for training and augmenting conversational AI in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

TL;DR: The study evaluates six LLMs and four MLLMs on Brazilian Portuguese medical exam questions, revealing performance gaps, especially in multimodal tasks, and underscores the need for non-English AI evaluation in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in AI performance across languages, particularly in healthcare, by evaluating LLMs and MLLMs on non-English medical questions.

Method: Benchmarked six LLMs and four MLLMs against human candidates using Brazilian Portuguese medical exam questions, assessing accuracy, processing time, and explanation coherence.

Result: Some models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus) matched human accuracy, but gaps persisted in multimodal tasks. Language disparities highlighted the need for non-English AI fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study stresses evaluating AI in diverse linguistic and clinical settings for fair healthcare deployment, calling for improved training and multimodal reasoning in future research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

TL;DR: A high-quality dataset of 1,017 expert-annotated social media posts for fine-grained depression detection is introduced. The study evaluates LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet) for generating clinical explanations using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, highlighting performance differences and the role of human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of depression via social media can enable timely interventions. Existing datasets lack fine-grained labels, limiting model evaluation and explanation quality.

Method: A clinically grounded dataset with depressive spans and symptom categories is created. LLMs are evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies for generating explanations.

Result: Significant performance differences among LLMs in clinical explanation tasks are observed. Few-shot prompting with domain-adapted examples improves results.

Conclusion: Human expertise is crucial for guiding LLM behavior in mental health applications. The work advances safer, more transparent AI for psychological well-being.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for
psychological well-being.

*Yi Su,Quantong Qiu,Yuechi Zhou,Juntao Li,Qingrong Xia,Ping Li,Xinyu Duan,Zhefeng Wang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaliDrop, a calibration-enhanced token eviction strategy to reduce memory usage in LLMs without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face memory bottlenecks due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length, batch size, and model size. Existing token eviction methods reduce memory but degrade accuracy.

Method: CaliDrop leverages the similarity of queries at nearby positions to perform speculative calibration on discarded tokens, mitigating accuracy loss from eviction.

Result: Experiments show CaliDrop significantly improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

Conclusion: CaliDrop effectively balances memory efficiency and accuracy in LLMs, enhancing token eviction strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address societal biases in LLM outputs to ensure fairness and reduce harm.

Method: Proposes KLAAD, using Cross-Entropy, KL divergence, and Triplet losses to align attention distributions between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical pairs.

Result: Improved bias mitigation on BBQ and BOLD benchmarks with minimal impact on language quality.

Conclusion: Attention-level alignment is a principled approach for bias mitigation in generative language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL

biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data
interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations
from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the
rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark
designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and
diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier
detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a

annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,
and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source
models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges,
and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose
the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the
textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26%
to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce
an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment
across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer

Motivation: To assess the reliability of LLMs in scoring writing tasks compared to human raters, focusing on AP Chinese exams.

Method: Generalizability theory was used to compare score consistency between human and AI raters for story narration and email response tasks. Essays were scored holistically and analytically by two humans and seven AI raters.

Result: Human raters were more reliable overall, but LLMs showed consistency for story narration. Hybrid scoring (human + AI) improved reliability.

Conclusion: Hybrid scoring models combining human and AI raters can enhance reliability in large-scale writing assessments.

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language
models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture
Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal NLP faces challenges in low-resource languages like Vietnamese due to lack of annotated data, necessitating tailored datasets like VLQA.

Method: The authors create the VLQA dataset, perform statistical analysis, and test it on legal information retrieval and question-answering tasks using advanced models.

Result: The VLQA dataset proves effective for legal NLP tasks in Vietnamese, demonstrating its utility despite resource limitations.

Conclusion: The VLQA dataset fills a critical gap in Vietnamese legal NLP, enabling better AI applications in this domain.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity
of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for
supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In
this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality
resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its
effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal
information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Motivation: Anomalies in language (spam, fake news, hate speech) are sparse and variable, requiring robust detection with limited labeled data.

Method: Treats anomaly detection as few-shot binary classification, using meta-learning with episodic training, prototypical networks, and domain resampling.

Result: Outperforms baselines in F1 and AUC scores on datasets like SMS spam, COVID-19 fake news, and hate speech.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes well to unseen tasks, and code/benchmarks are released for further research.

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human
language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in
language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly

TL;DR: FAEDKV is a training-free KV cache compression framework for LLMs, using frequency-domain transformation to retain unbiased information, outperforming existing methods by up to 22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory and computational inefficiencies of KV cache in LLMs, while avoiding biased representations from current compression methods.

Method: Transforms KV cache into the frequency domain using Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT) for equalized token contribution and targeted compression.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by up to 22% on LongBench and shows superior retrieval accuracy in position-agnostic tasks.

Conclusion: FAEDKV provides an effective, unbiased solution for KV cache compression without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based
approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating complex statistical infographics from text-heavy documents using a two-stage LLM framework, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI tools only generate simple charts, lacking the ability to create complex infographics from text-heavy content.

Method: Proposes Infogen, a two-stage framework: fine-tuned LLMs generate metadata, which is then converted into infographic code.

Result: Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Infodat benchmark, surpassing other LLMs.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in generating complex infographics, offering a robust solution for text-to-infographic tasks.

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

### [30] [A Tensor-Based Compiler and a Runtime for Neuron-Level DNN Certifier Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20055)
*Avaljot Singh,Yamin Chandini Sarita,Aditya Mishra,Ishaan Goyal,Gagandeep Singh,Charith Mendis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A compiler framework automates the translation of neuron-level DNN certifier specifications into tensor-based implementations, bridging the semantic gap and enabling easier development of new certifiers with performance comparable to hand-optimized solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in developing or modifying DNN certifiers due to the semantic gap between neuron-level design and tensor-level implementation motivates the need for an automated solution.

Method: Proposes a compiler with a stack-based IR and shape analysis to translate neuron-level specs into tensor operations, introducing g-BCSR for efficient sparse tensor representation.

Result: The compiler simplifies certifier development, maintains performance parity with hand-optimized implementations, and supports diverse DNNs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the design-implementation gap, making DNN certification more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

*Ran Xu,Yuchen Zhuang,Yue Yu,Haoyu Wang,Wenqi Shi,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG improves LLMs with external knowledge but struggles in diverse, real-world retrieval scenarios, showing limitations in model size benefits, reranker value, and source consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore RAG's effectiveness beyond general-domain benchmarks and assess its performance in realistic, diverse retrieval settings.

Method: Evaluated RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixed knowledge, analyzing retrieval benefits, reranker impact, and source performance.

Result: Retrieval mainly aids smaller models, rerankers add little value, no single source excels, and LLMs struggle with routing queries across diverse sources.

Conclusion: Adaptive retrieval strategies are needed for real-world RAG deployment, as current systems face significant limitations.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can

### [32] [ProsodyLM: Uncovering the Emerging Prosody Processing Capabilities in Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20091)
*Kaizhi Qian,Xulin Fan,Junrui Ni,Slava Shechtman,Mark Hasegawa-Johnson,Chuang Gan,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProsodyLM introduces a novel tokenization scheme for speech language models to better capture prosody, outperforming conventional methods in learning diverse prosody processing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech language models struggle to capture the interdependency between content and prosody due to sub-optimal tokenization methods.

Method: ProsodyLM transcribes speech into text followed by word-level prosody tokens, retaining more prosody information and being more understandable to LLMs.

Result: ProsodyLM learns diverse prosody processing capabilities, including nuanced prosody generation, emotion/stress understanding, and long-context consistency.

Conclusion: ProsodyLM's tokenization scheme effectively enhances prosody learning in speech language models, demonstrating superior emerging capabilities.

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

*Rodrigo Gabriel Salazar Alva,Mat√≠as Nu√±ez,Cristian L√≥pez,Javier Mart√≠n Arista*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable framework using LLMs to generate high-quality Old English texts, combining LoRA, backtranslation, and a dual-agent pipeline, achieving significant improvements in translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Old English is under-resourced, limiting NLP accessibility; this work aims to bridge the gap and aid cultural preservation.

Method: Uses LoRA for efficient fine-tuning, backtranslation for data augmentation, and a dual-agent pipeline for content generation and translation.

Result: BLEU scores improved from 26 to over 65; human assessment confirmed high grammatical and stylistic accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively revitalizes Old English and offers a blueprint for preserving other endangered languages.

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's
cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically
under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language
processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced
large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of
cultural preservation.

*Anas Mohamed,Azal Ahmad Khan,Xinran Wang,Ahmad Faraz Khan,Shuwen Ge,Saman Bahzad Khan,Ayaan Ahmad,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sem-DPO improves DPO by ensuring semantic consistency in prompt optimization, outperforming DPO and baselines in text-to-image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic drift in DPO-based prompt optimization while retaining simplicity and efficiency.

Method: Introduces Sem-DPO, scaling DPO loss by cosine distance in embedding space to down-weight semantically mismatched prompts.

Result: Achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores than DPO, with provable semantic drift bounds.

Conclusion: Sem-DPO sets a new standard for prompt optimization, enabling semantics-aware preference tuning in language models.

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Team CRUISE's solution for KDD Cup 2025 CRAG-MM challenge addresses VLMs' hallucination issues with a multi-stage framework, achieving 3rd place in Task 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern VLMs often hallucinate with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and multi-hop questions, posing problems for fact-seeking queries.

Method: A multi-stage framework with query routing, retrieval, summarization, dual-path generation, and post-hoc verification to minimize hallucinations.

Result: Achieved 3rd place in Task 1, proving effectiveness in prioritizing factual accuracy.

Conclusion: The conservative, reliability-focused approach is effective for complex multi-modal RAG systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of Document Understanding (DU) in long-context scenarios, proposing an automated multi-agent framework to generate high-quality questions for training LVLMs, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) declines in long-context DU tasks due to scarce fine-grained training data, especially for low-resource languages. Human annotation is costly and inefficient.

Method: A fully automated, multi-agent interactive framework is introduced to efficiently generate long-context questions for extensive English and Arabic documents.

Result: The generated questions (AraEngLongBench) are challenging for major LVLMs, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances LVLMs' long-context understanding ability and provides a scalable solution for training data generation.

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our
approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions
for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across
diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced
long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have
shown that our generated English and Arabic questions
(\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and
close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with consistent goal-oriented behavior in multi-turn conversations, limiting their reliability in applications.

Method: A three-stage methodology leveraging UGST to track goal progression and generate goal-aligned responses, evaluated on MultiWOZ 2.4 and œÑ-Bench.

Result: Substantial improvements in goal alignment metrics across benchmarks.

Conclusion: UGST addresses a critical gap in conversational AI, establishing it as essential for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

*Hyeonji Lee,Daejin Jo,Seohwan Yun,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGPO is a self-improving alignment framework for LLMs that generates its own preference data, outperforming DPO and baselines without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional alignment methods like dependency on human-annotated data and distribution shift issues.

Method: Uses an on-policy self-improving mechanism where a unified model (improver + policy) refines responses to generate preference data for DPO.

Result: SGPO significantly improves performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGPO offers a scalable and effective alternative to traditional alignment methods by leveraging self-generated preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse
datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and
reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an intention tree concept and a dataset curation pipeline to address gaps in modeling customer intentions in E-commerce sessions, proposing a benchmark (SessionIntentBench) to evaluate intention understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works inadequately capture customer intentions due to insufficient data exploitation and lack of benchmarks for explicit intention modeling in E-commerce sessions.

Method: Proposes an intention tree and dataset curation pipeline, constructing SessionIntentBench with extensive session data and human-annotated ground-truth labels.

Result: Current L(V)LMs fail to effectively capture intentions in complex session settings, but injecting intention improves LLM performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable solution for intention understanding in E-commerce sessions, highlighting the need for better intention modeling in L(V)LMs.

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

*Yumeng Wang,Zhiyuan Fan,Jiayu Liu,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiRole-R1 enhances reasoning diversity in large models by incorporating multiple role perspectives, improving accuracy and diversity in subjective tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with subjective questions due to homogeneous reasoning from single ground truths. Increasing role perspectives improves performance.

Method: Proposes MultiRole-R1, using unsupervised data construction for diverse reasoning chains and reinforcement learning (GRPO) with diversity rewards.

Result: Improves accuracy and diversity in reasoning, showing a positive link between diversity and accuracy across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diversity-enhanced training in large reasoning models is effective for both subjective and objective tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

*Aviya Maimon,Amir DN Cohen,Gal Vishne,Shauli Ravfogel,Reut Tsarfaty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation paradigm for LLMs using factor analysis to identify latent skills, addressing limitations of current benchmark-based assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations rely on benchmark scores, which lack clarity on task relationships, commonalities, and redundancies, leading to incomplete model assessments.

Method: The authors use factor analysis on a leaderboard of 60 LLMs tested on 44 tasks to uncover latent skills driving performance.

Result: A small set of latent skills explains most performance variations, enabling tools for task redundancy, model selection, and skill profiling.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm offers a more holistic and interpretable approach to evaluating LLMs, improving understanding of their strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Thuat Thien Nguyen,Minh Nhat Ta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework combining multi-view news modeling (NAML) and dual-scale user interest modeling (LSTUR), achieving state-of-the-art results on MIND benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of modeling multi-view news representations and dynamic user interests (short- and long-term) in news recommendation systems.

Method: Integrates NAML for multi-view news modeling and LSTUR for user interest modeling, enhanced with BERT-based word embeddings.

Result: Substantial improvements over baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale user modeling is effective for news recommendation.

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces INT and IMA, a framework for enhancing mental health support via LLMs by simulating narrative therapy and tracking therapeutic progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based mental health approaches lack realism and fail to capture therapeutic progression, while narrative therapy is underutilized due to access and stigma.

Method: INT simulates expert narrative therapists with planned stages and expert-like responses, while IMA evaluates therapy progress by tracking "Innovative Moments" in client speech.

Result: INT outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth, with experimental validation on simulated and human participants.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances mental health support, demonstrating potential for social applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores professionalism in expert questioning, using linguistic features to model and evaluate it in finance. A novel annotation framework is introduced, and datasets show linguistic features correlate with professionalism and authorship. A classifier based on these features outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professionalism is underexplored in expert communication, especially in high-stakes domains like finance. The study aims to model and evaluate professionalism using linguistic features.

Method: Introduces a novel annotation framework for structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst questions. Uses human-authored and LLM-generated questions to create datasets annotated for professionalism and authorship.

Result: Linguistic features correlate with both human judgments and authorship origin. A classifier trained on these features outperforms baselines in distinguishing expert-authored questions.

Conclusion: Professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be modeled linguistically, with practical implications for expert communication.

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Post-Completion Learning (PCL) extends training beyond the <eos> token, improving reasoning and self-evaluation by leveraging post-output space with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training stops at <eos>, missing learning opportunities in post-completion space. PCL aims to enhance reasoning and self-evaluation.

Method: PCL uses white-box reinforcement learning for self-assessment and reward prediction. Dual-track SFT optimizes reasoning and evaluation, combined with RL for hybrid optimization.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements over SFT and RL methods across datasets and models.

Conclusion: PCL offers a novel training approach, boosting output quality without compromising deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

*Abeer Aldayel,Areej Alokaili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques surface-level inclusion in conversation models, proposing a framework to evaluate implicit opinions via stance analysis for more equitable representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for inclusive representation in models rely on overt cues like demographics, missing nuanced opinions and risking harmful stereotypes.

Method: The study introduces an alignment evaluation framework using stance of responses as a proxy for opinion, tested with PU learning and instruction-tuned models.

Result: The framework assesses implicit opinion representation, revealing gaps and offering insights for more inclusive model behavior.

Conclusion: The approach advances equitable inclusion by addressing implicit opinions, guiding models toward fairer, nuanced representations.

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

*Kang Yang,Jingxue Chen,Qingkun Tang,Tianxiang Zhang,Qianchun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoL-RL integrates multi-step environmental feedback into LLMs for feedback-independent reasoning, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current approaches in leveraging sequential feedback for chain-of-thought reasoning without losing contextual information.

Method: Combines MoL continual training (dual-objective optimization) with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential feedback into single-step inferences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25, and CodeAgent-Test benchmarks with Qwen3-8B.

Conclusion: MoL-RL enhances LLMs' reasoning by effectively using multi-step textual feedback, generalizing well across model scales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

### [48] [What Language(s) Does Aya-23 Think In? How Multilinguality Affects Internal Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20279)
*Katharina Trinley,Toshiki Nakai,Tatiana Anikina,Tanja Baeumel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Aya-23-8B, a multilingual LLM, processes code-mixed, cloze, and translation tasks differently than monolingual models, with typologically related language representations and script similarity influencing its internal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multilingual training in LLMs like Aya-23-8B affects their internal language processing compared to monolingual models.

Method: Analyzed Aya-23-8B using logit lens and neuron specialization techniques on code-mixed, cloze, and translation tasks, comparing it to Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2.

Result: Aya-23 activates related language representations for translation, shows base-language-dependent code-mixed neuron patterns, and has language-specific neurons in final layers. Script and typology impact processing.

Conclusion: Multilingual training shapes LLM internals distinctly, offering insights for cross-lingual transfer research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

*Abdullah Alabdullah,Lifeng Han,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Dialectal Arabic (DA) NLP by evaluating training-free prompting techniques and developing a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline for DA-MSA translation. GPT-4o and quantized Gemma2-9B models showed high performance, with multi-dialect training and 4-bit quantization offering significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialectal Arabic (DA) limits access to digital services and educational resources due to its divergence from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), hindering Arabic NLP progress.

Method: Evaluated training-free prompting techniques (few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought, Ara-TEaR) across six LLMs and developed a fine-tuning pipeline with quantized models.

Result: GPT-4o performed best in prompting, while quantized Gemma2-9B achieved a CHrF++ score of 49.88. Multi-dialect training improved performance by 10%, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical approach to enhance DA-MSA translation, demonstrating feasibility in low-resource settings and promoting inclusive Arabic NLP.

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

TL;DR: DYNARTmo is a dynamic articulatory model for visualizing speech articulation in 2D, based on UK-DYNAMO, with applications in education and therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance phonetics education and speech therapy by providing a dynamic visualization tool for speech articulation processes.

Method: Integrates articulatory underspecification, segmental/gestural control, and coarticulation, simulating six articulators via continuous and discrete parameters.

Result: A web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) with sagittal, glottal, and palatal views for practical use.

Conclusion: DYNARTmo effectively models static articulatory configurations, with future work planned for dynamic movement and acoustic integration.

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize
speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model
builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory
underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation.
DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six
discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and
consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education
and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects,
future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with
articulatory-acoustic modules.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RMTBench is a user-centric bilingual role-playing benchmark for evaluating LLMs, featuring diverse characters and multi-turn dialogues based on user motivations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are character-centric and oversimplify interactions, failing to reflect real-world applications. RMTBench addresses this by focusing on user intentions.

Method: RMTBench includes 80 diverse characters and 8,000+ dialogue rounds, simulating multi-turn dialogues with explicit user motivations. It uses LLM-based scoring for evaluation.

Result: The benchmark provides a more practical framework for assessing LLM role-playing capabilities by aligning with user applications.

Conclusion: RMTBench bridges the gap between academic evaluation and real-world deployment, offering a comprehensive tool for LLM role-playing assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

*Sangjun Moon,Dasom Choi,Jingun Kwon,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs internally encode output sequence length, revealing multi-head attention's role in disentangled length control without losing text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of LLMs in controlling output sequence length, which remains unexplored despite their capabilities.

Method: Empirical analysis of internal representations in LLMs, focusing on multi-head attention and scaling specific hidden units to adjust sequence length.

Result: Multi-head attention is key for disentangled length control; some hidden units reflect length-specific awareness without compromising text informativeness.

Conclusion: LLMs have adaptable internal mechanisms for output length control, independent of external intervention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

*Eunkyu Park,Wesley Hanwen Deng,Gunhee Kim,Motahhare Eslami,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoT, a three-stage prompting strategy (perception, situation, norm), outperforms CoT and direct prompting in visual tasks requiring social context, improving VLM reasoning by 8% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flat CoT often fails in visual tasks requiring simultaneous perception, understanding, and judgment in social contexts. CoCoT aims to bridge this gap by structuring reasoning into cognitively inspired stages.

Method: CoCoT scaffolds VLM reasoning through three stages: perception (seeing), situation (understanding), and norm (judging). It is tested on multimodal benchmarks like intent disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety.

Result: CoCoT consistently outperforms CoT and direct prompting by an average of 8% across benchmarks. It enhances interpretability and social awareness in VLMs.

Conclusion: Cognitively grounded reasoning stages (CoCoT) improve VLM performance in socially grounded visual tasks, suggesting safer and more reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

*George Ibrahim,Rita Ramos,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CONCAP improves multilingual image captioning by integrating retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, reducing data needs and performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual vision-language models lag behind English ones due to limited training data and costly parameterization. RAG helps but introduces biases from translated captions.

Method: CONCAP combines retrieved captions with image-specific concepts to enhance contextualization and grounding across languages.

Result: Experiments on XM3600 show strong performance for low- and mid-resource languages with reduced data requirements.

Conclusion: Concept-aware retrieval augmentation effectively bridges multilingual performance gaps.

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

*Khloud AL Jallad,Nada Ghneim,Ghaida Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey of NLU benchmarks, focusing on diagnostics datasets and linguistic phenomena, identifies gaps in standardization and proposes a need for evaluation metrics similar to ISO standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To review and compare NLU benchmarks, especially diagnostics datasets, and highlight the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for linguistic phenomena.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, focusing on diagnostics datasets and their linguistic coverage.

Result: Identified gaps in naming conventions and standard linguistic phenomena coverage, proposing a research question on evaluation standardization.

Conclusion: Advocates for standardized evaluation metrics to improve insights and comparisons across NLU diagnostics benchmarks.

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

*Sungwoo Han,Hyeyeon Kim,Jingun Kwon,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel code-based prompting method improves NER performance in LLMs by embedding detailed BIO schema instructions, outperforming text-based prompting across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NER methods using LLMs lack detailed labeling instructions, relying only on input context. The paper addresses this gap by leveraging code-based prompts.

Method: Proposes code-based prompting to embed BIO schema instructions in prompts, enhancing LLMs' understanding of NER tasks. Combines this with chain-of-thought prompting for further improvement.

Result: Outperforms text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets.

Conclusion: Code-based prompting effectively structures NER instructions, improving LLM performance, especially when combined with chain-of-thought prompting.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text-JEPA is a lightweight framework for converting natural language to first-order logic, improving efficiency and explainability in closed-domain QA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-domain QA systems require transparent reasoning and explainability, which current LLM-based approaches lack due to inefficiencies in logic translation.

Method: Text-JEPA combines neural-symbolic methods, using a dual-system approach (System 1 for logic generation and System 2 for inference with Z3 solver) and introduces custom metrics for evaluation.

Result: Text-JEPA achieves competitive performance with lower computational costs compared to larger LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for efficient, interpretable QA systems in specialized domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

TL;DR: AQUA is the first large language model (LLM) for aquaculture, addressing industry challenges like disease and inefficiency with AQUADAPT, a framework for synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aquaculture is crucial for food security but faces challenges like disease and inefficiency; existing AI methods lack domain-specific solutions.

Method: Introduces AQUA, an LLM for aquaculture, and AQUADAPT, a framework combining expert knowledge, LLMs, and automated evaluation for synthetic data.

Result: AQUA and AQUADAPT provide a foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research and decision-making.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in aquaculture-specific AI solutions, enabling better research and industry tools.

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies
by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet
rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,
inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,
and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water
quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant
progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a
combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated
evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations
in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

TL;DR: SAND-Math introduces a pipeline to generate and enhance difficult mathematical problems for training LLMs, significantly improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of challenging training data for mathematical reasoning in LLMs limits their development and performance.

Method: SAND-Math uses a pipeline to generate high-quality problems and increases their complexity via a 'Difficulty Hiking' step.

Result: Augmenting a baseline with SAND-Math data boosts performance by 17.85 points on AIME25, and Difficulty Hiking improves results from 46.38% to 49.23%.

Conclusion: SAND-Math provides a scalable toolkit for enhancing mathematical reasoning in LLMs, with the dataset and model publicly available.

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated
mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development
of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic
Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline
that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty
Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key
findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable
toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: To understand the interaction between hate and counter-hate speech in social media and their impact on online behavior.

Method: Annotation of 92 conversations (720 tweets) and statistical analysis incorporating public metrics.

Result: Insights into hate message spread, counter strategies, and their behavioral impact.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for analyzing hate and counter-hate speech, offering valuable insights for online discourse.

Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-labeled scheme for joint annotation of hate and
counter-hate speech in social media conversations, categorizing hate and
counter-hate messages into thematic and rhetorical dimensions. The thematic
categories outline different discursive aspects of each type of speech, while
the rhetorical dimension captures how hate and counter messages are
communicated, drawing on Aristotle's Logos, Ethos and Pathos. We annotate a
sample of 92 conversations, consisting of 720 tweets, and conduct statistical
analyses, incorporating public metrics, to explore patterns of interaction
between the thematic and rhetorical dimensions within and between hate and
counter-hate speech. Our findings provide insights into the spread of hate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting hallucinations in black-box LLM-generated text, which lacks transparency.

Method: Sample future contexts to detect persistent hallucinations, integrating with existing sampling-based methods.

Result: Demonstrated performance improvements across multiple methods using the proposed sampling approach.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances hallucination detection in black-box LLM outputs by leveraging future context sampling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on
online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users
increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has
become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing
a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Method: Ensembles similarity scores from CLIP, SigLIP, and DINOv2 for retrieval. Uses Gemma 3 with engineered prompts for captioning.

Result: Achieved a score of 0.42002, ranking 4th on the private test set.

Conclusion: Combining foundation models through ensembling and prompting is effective for zero-shot tasks.

Abstract: We present ZSE-Cap (Zero-Shot Ensemble for Captioning), our 4th place system
in Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) shared task on article-grounded image
retrieval and captioning. Our zero-shot approach requires no finetuning on the
competition's data. For retrieval, we ensemble similarity scores from CLIP,
SigLIP, and DINOv2. For captioning, we leverage a carefully engineered prompt
to guide the Gemma 3 model, enabling it to link high-level events from the
article to the visual content in the image. Our system achieved a final score
of 0.42002, securing a top-4 position on the private test set, demonstrating
the effectiveness of combining foundation models through ensembling and
prompting. Our code is available at https://github.com/ductai05/ZSE-Cap.

### [63] [Before the Outrage: Challenges and Advances in Predicting Online Antisocial Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20614)
*Ana√Øs Ollagnier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic review of 49 studies on antisocial behavior (ASB) prediction, proposing a taxonomy of five core tasks and analyzing trends in modeling techniques and dataset challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragmented state of ASB prediction research by unifying existing methods and identifying gaps for future work.

Method: Systematic review of 49 studies, categorizing tasks into five types and analyzing modeling techniques and dataset influences.

Result: Identified five core task types, trends in modeling, and challenges like dataset scarcity and temporal drift.

Conclusion: Provides a framework to guide future research toward robust and socially responsible ASB prediction.

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OL-KGC integrates neural-perceptual structural info with ontological knowledge in LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KGC lacks conclusive reasoning due to implicit knowledge representation and error propagation.

Method: OL-KGC embeds structural info textually, extracts ontological knowledge from KGs, and transforms it for LLM logic guidance.

Result: OL-KGC achieves state-of-the-art performance on FB15K-237, UMLS, and WN18RR benchmarks.

Conclusion: OL-KGC enhances KGC by combining structural and ontological knowledge, improving reasoning outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

*Yuzhong Zhao,Yue Liu,Junpeng Liu,Jingye Chen,Xun Wu,Yaru Hao,Tengchao Lv,Shaohan Huang,Lei Cui,Qixiang Ye,Fang Wan,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMPO improves GRPO by optimizing the geometric mean of token-level rewards, enhancing stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's instability due to outlier rewards during policy updates motivates the need for a more stable method.

Method: GMPO replaces the arithmetic mean with the geometric mean of token-level rewards to reduce sensitivity to outliers.

Result: GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by 4.1% on math benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GMPO offers a stable and superior alternative to GRPO, with proven theoretical and experimental benefits.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

*Hanna Shcharbakova,Tatiana Anikina,Natalia Skachkova,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smaller specialized models like XLM-R outperform large language models (LLMs) in multilingual fact verification, achieving 57.7% macro-F1, a 15.8% improvement over previous benchmarks. LLMs show biases and struggle with evidence utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation necessitates robust automated fact verification systems capable of nuanced assessments across diverse languages.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models (XLM-R, mT5, Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo) on the X-Fact dataset (25 languages, 7 veracity categories) using prompting and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: XLM-R (270M parameters) outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 vs. 16.9% for the best LLM. This is a 15.8% improvement over prior benchmarks. LLMs exhibit biases and struggle with evidence.

Conclusion: For fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized models like XLM-R are more effective than general-purpose LLMs, impacting practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

*Gabriel Downer,Sean Craven,Damian Ruck,Jake Thomas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2VLM is a pipeline converting text-only datasets into multimodal formats to evaluate VLMs' resilience against typographic prompt injection attacks, revealing vulnerabilities in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation datasets focus on text-only prompts, neglecting visual vulnerabilities in VLMs, necessitating a tool for comprehensive safety assessment.

Method: Text2VLM adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats by identifying harmful content and converting it into typographic images for VLM evaluation.

Result: Open-source VLMs show increased susceptibility to prompt injection with visual inputs, highlighting weaknesses in model alignment and a performance gap with closed-source models.

Conclusion: Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for assessing multimodal vulnerabilities, advancing safer VLM deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems
necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal
content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

### [68] [Investigating Structural Pruning and Recovery Techniques for Compressing Multimodal Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20749)
*Yiran Huang,Lukas Thede,Massimiliano Mancini,Wenjia Xu,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes compressing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) via structural pruning and recovery training, showing effective performance retention with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter reduction techniques for MLLMs are inflexible and computationally intensive, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Structural pruning (layerwise and widthwise) combined with supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation, tested on LLaVA-v1.5-7B and Bunny-v1.0-3B.

Result: Widthwise pruning performs better in low-resource scenarios; recovery training with 5% data retains 95% performance.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical solution for compressing MLLMs efficiently with limited resources or data.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

*Carlo Alfano,Aymen Al Marjani,Zeno Jonke,Amin Mantrach,Saab Mansour,Marcello Federico*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for multilingual faithfulness evaluation of LLMs using synthetic data and cross-lingual transfer learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multilingual faithfulness evaluators for LLMs without relying on expensive human-labeled data.

Method: Uses synthetic multilingual summarization data and cross-lingual transfer learning, comparing language-specific and mixed-language fine-tuning.

Result: Shows improvement over baselines, including state-of-the-art English evaluators and translation-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages synthetic data and cross-lingual transfer for accurate multilingual faithfulness evaluation.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey on general-purpose text embeddings (GPTE) in the era of pretrained language models (PLMs), covering their architecture, PLM roles, advanced applications, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE, highlighting the roles of PLMs in their development and exploring future potential.

Method: Examines fundamental GPTE architecture, PLM roles (embedding extraction, expressivity, training, objectives, data), and advanced applications (multilingual, multimodal, code understanding).

Result: Identifies key contributions of PLMs to GPTE and outlines advanced capabilities like multilingual support and scenario-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a reference for understanding GPTE's current state and future directions, including safety, bias mitigation, and cognitive extensions.

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

*Sam Osian,Arpan Dutta,Sahil Bhandari,Iain E. Buchan,Dan W. Joyce*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit) identified 72 child-suicide PFD reports, doubling the manual count by ONS, with high reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if automated language models can replicate and improve the manual identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide PFD reports.

Method: Processed 4,249 PFD reports using PFD Toolkit's LLM pipelines, screening for child-suicide cases and coding them for themes. Validated with clinician adjudication.

Result: Identified 72 cases (vs. ONS's 37), with high agreement (Cohen's Œ∫ = 0.82) and runtime of 8m 16s.

Conclusion: Automated LLM analysis is reliable and efficient for thematic reviews, enabling scalable public health insights.

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

*Yilun Qiu,Tianhao Shi,Xiaoyan Zhao,Fengbin Zhu,Yang Zhang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEP is a framework for personalized LLM outputs by modeling inter-user differences in latent space, outperforming baselines in review generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of language-based prompts in capturing inter-user differences for effective personalization in LLMs.

Method: Uses Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP) to model user differences in latent space, contrasting user embeddings with peers and filtering via sparse autoencoder.

Result: DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods in personalized review generation across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: DEP effectively captures inter-user differences for better personalization in LLMs, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

*Louis Est√®ve,Marie-Catherine de Marneffe,Nurit Melnik,Agata Savary,Olha Kanishcheva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys diversity in NLP, proposes a unified taxonomy, and applies a framework from ecology/economy to standardize diversity measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ad hoc and inconsistent treatment of diversity in NLP and link it to better-theorized domains.

Method: Surveyed ACL Anthology papers from 6 years with 'diversity' or 'diverse' in titles, analyzed diversity measures, and proposed a unified taxonomy using Stirling's framework.

Result: Found inconsistent terminology and specialized diversity measures; proposed a 3-dimension framework (variety, balance, disparity) for standardization.

Conclusion: The study aims to improve formalization, understanding, and comparability of diversity in NLP.

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

*Luc Builtjes,Joeran Bosma,Mathias Prokop,Bram van Ginneken,Alessa Hering*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-source LLMs like Phi-4-14B and Llama-3.3-70B perform well on clinical info extraction in Dutch, with native-language processing being key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary LLMs lack transparency and raise privacy concerns, limiting their use in healthcare. Open-source alternatives are needed.

Method: Evaluated nine open-source LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark (28 Dutch clinical tasks) using the llm_extractinator framework in zero-shot settings.

Result: 14B-parameter models (Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, DeepSeek-R1-14B) were competitive; Llama-3.3-70B performed slightly better but at higher cost. English translation hurt performance.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs with native-language processing offer scalable, privacy-conscious solutions for clinical info extraction in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

*Jungwon Park,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soft Injection of task embeddings for LLMs, replacing in-prompt examples with pre-constructed task embeddings, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL methods rely on multiple in-prompt examples, which may not be optimal for efficiency or effectiveness.

Method: Softly mixes pre-optimized task embeddings with attention head activations using soft head-selection parameters.

Result: Outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, reducing memory and compute costs.

Conclusion: Soft Injection shifts task conditioning to activation space, improving performance and offering insights into attention head roles.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Conclusion: MediQAl fills a gap in multilingual medical resources and offers a benchmark for evaluating language models in French medical QA.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset
designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical
recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains
32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical
subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with
Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii)
Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as
Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive
capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with
14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and
observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning
tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language
models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial

*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Adrian Jaques B√∂ck,Djordje Slijepƒçeviƒá,Xihui Chen,Andreas Babic,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents solutions for identifying and classifying sexism in social media posts using three models: SCBM, SCBMT, and fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa, achieving competitive results in the EXIST 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the widespread issue of sexism in online conversations by developing interpretable and effective models for sexism identification and classification.

Method: Three models are implemented: SCBM (using human-interpretable adjectives), SCBMT (combining adjectives with transformer embeddings), and fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa. Additional metadata like annotator demographics is also explored.

Result: XLM-RoBERTa ranked 6th for English and Spanish, and 4th for English in Soft-Soft evaluation. SCBMT achieved 7th for English and Spanish, and 6th for Spanish.

Conclusion: The proposed models, especially SCBMT and XLM-RoBERTa, offer competitive performance and interpretability, advancing efforts to combat online sexism.

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

*Likun Tan,Kuan-Wei Huang,Kevin Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect and edit factual inaccuracies in large language model responses, focusing on financial domains. Fine-tuned models show significant improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucinations in large language models to ensure factual reliability, especially in high-stakes domains like finance.

Method: Constructs a synthetic dataset using a domain-specific error taxonomy, fine-tunes four models (Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-14B) for detection and editing.

Result: Fine-tuned Phi-4 achieves an 8% F1 score improvement and 30% overall detection gain. Phi-4-mini remains competitive with minimal performance drop.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for factual inconsistency detection and editing in financial text, with a generalizable framework for broader applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and

*Max Peeperkorn,Tom Kouwenhoven,Dan Brown,Anna Jordanous*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning LLMs reduces output diversity, especially in creative tasks. A new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, helps reintroduce diversity while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the 'diversity gap' caused by instruction-tuning in LLMs and propose a solution to mitigate it.

Method: Analyze diversity loss in OLMo and OLMo 2 models, identify DPO's impact, and introduce conformative decoding to enhance diversity.

Result: Instruction-tuning significantly reduces diversity; conformative decoding increases diversity without compromising quality.

Conclusion: Conformative decoding effectively addresses the diversity gap in instruction-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores memorization in fine-tuned LLMs, focusing on medical data privacy. It uses membership inference and generation tasks to analyze memorization, revealing key factors like matrix impact, perplexity, and LoRA rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how fine-tuning affects memorization in LLMs, especially in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: Uses membership inference attacks and generation tasks with the PHEE dataset, examining weight matrices, perplexity, and LoRA ranks.

Result: Value and Output matrices contribute more to memorization; lower perplexity increases memorization; higher LoRA ranks boost memorization but with diminishing returns.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between performance and privacy, aiding in responsible LLM adaptation strategies.

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAJ-EVAL is a framework using LLM agents to simulate human evaluators by creating personas from documents and enabling multi-agent debates for multi-dimensional feedback, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real human evaluators are scarce and costly, and current LLM-as-a-judge approaches lack well-designed personas and generalizability.

Method: MAJ-EVAL automatically constructs evaluator personas from documents, instantiates LLM agents, and uses multi-agent debates for feedback.

Result: MAJ-EVAL aligns better with human expert ratings than conventional metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Conclusion: MAJ-EVAL addresses limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge approaches and improves evaluation alignment with human perspectives.

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world
NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse
human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and
costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising
approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

### [82] [Tuning adaptive gamma correction (TAGC) for enhancing images in low ligh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19574)
*Ghufran Abualhail Alhamzawi,Ali Saeed Alfoudi,Ali Hakem Alsaeedi,Suha Mohammed Hadi,Amjed Abbas Ahmed,Md. Riad Hassan,Nurhizam Safie Mohd Satar,Waeel Yahya Yasseen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model called TAGC enhances low-light images by adaptively calculating gamma correction based on color luminance, improving quality without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light conditions degrade image quality, causing issues like low contrast, noise, and blur, which the TAGC model aims to address.

Method: The model analyzes color luminance and calculates an adaptive gamma coefficient automatically for different illumination levels.

Result: TAGC effectively improves low-light images, preserving details, contrast, and color distribution while providing natural visual quality.

Conclusion: TAGC is an efficient solution for low-light image enhancement in applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and photography.

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the 'Data Addition Dilemma' in medical imaging by proposing a method to control feature discrepancies in deep networks, improving segmentation performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and distributional shifts in multi-source medical imaging datasets hinder deep learning model performance.

Method: The authors use causal frameworks to control foreground-background feature discrepancies in deep networks for better feature representation.

Result: State-of-the-art segmentation performance is achieved on histopathology and ultrasound images across five datasets, including a novel curated dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating its effectiveness in data-addition scenarios.

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

*Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw,Jasmer Singh Sanjotra,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Shubhi Bansal,Shahid Shafi Dar,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-MPEDNet, a Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder Network, improves automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans by leveraging adaptive features, dynamic attention, and boundary refinement, outperforming 12 state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated liver and tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment but is challenged by tumor heterogeneity and diverse liver characteristics.

Method: T-MPEDNet uses a progressive encoder-decoder with skip connections, a Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism, and multi-scale features for refined local details, followed by morphological boundary refinement.

Result: T-MPEDNet achieves DSC scores of 97.6% (liver) and 89.1% (tumor) on LiTS, and 98.3% (liver) and 83.3% (tumor) on 3DIRCADb, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet is an effective and reliable framework for automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans.

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgPIS introduces a unified part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) model for surgical instruments, combining instrument-level and part-level segmentation with a transformer-based approach and weakly-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat instrument-level instance segmentation (IIS) and part-level semantic segmentation (PSS) separately, lacking interaction between tasks. A unified approach is needed for better automation in robot-assisted surgery.

Method: SurgPIS uses a transformer-based mask classification with part-specific queries linked to instrument-level queries. It employs weakly-supervised learning to train on disjoint datasets (IIS or PSS) and a student-teacher approach for consistency.

Result: SurgPIS achieves state-of-the-art performance in PIS, IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SurgPIS effectively unifies IIS and PSS, demonstrating superior performance and addressing the lack of large-scale labeled datasets through innovative weakly-supervised training.

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VideoLLM model for object-centric video interactions, proposes the STOM module for visual prompt propagation, and presents the VideoInfer dataset. It outperforms baselines in video QA and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs lack flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions and are limited to text-only responses.

Method: Introduces a VideoLLM model with object referring and grounding, the STOM module for visual prompt propagation, and the VideoInfer dataset.

Result: Outperforms baselines in 12 benchmarks across 6 tasks, showing robustness in multimodal video understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances object-centric video interactions and demonstrates superior performance in video QA and segmentation.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

TL;DR: Exemplar Med-DETR, a multi-modal contrastive detector, improves abnormality detection in medical images by leveraging class-specific exemplar features and cross-attention, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with learning effective class-specific features in medical imaging, especially in dense breast tissue, limiting their applicability across tasks and modalities.

Method: The proposed Exemplar Med-DETR uses cross-attention with intuitive class-specific exemplar features and an iterative training strategy.

Result: Achieves mAP of 0.7 for mass detection and 0.55 for calcifications in mammograms, with improvements in chest X-rays and angiography. Outperforms existing methods by significant margins.

Conclusion: Exemplar Med-DETR demonstrates robust and generalizable performance, advancing medical imaging detection systems.

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of standardized tooling for rigorous comparison in medical image segmentation.

Method: Extends MIST's postprocessing module with transforms like object removal, connected components extraction, and morphological operations, composable into user-defined strategies.

Result: Evaluated three strategies using BraTS protocol, demonstrating MIST's ability to refine segmentations effectively.

Conclusion: MIST supports reproducible, scalable research and rapid experimentation for high-quality segmentations in medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPAIN is a synthetic dataset for pain detection, addressing diversity gaps and algorithmic bias in existing models. It improves performance and fairness in pain assessment for older adults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pain assessment in non-communicative patients, like older adults with dementia, is challenging. Existing datasets lack diversity and underrepresent the target population.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset (SynPAIN) using generative AI, balanced across ethnicities, ages, and genders. Validated pain expressions using clinical tools and tested for bias in existing models.

Result: SynPAIN revealed algorithmic biases and improved pain detection performance by 7.0% in real clinical data when used for augmentation.

Conclusion: SynPAIN fills critical gaps in pain assessment research, offering a diverse, synthetic dataset and a framework for bias mitigation.

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

### [90] [Efficient Learning for Product Attributes with Compact Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19679)
*Mandar Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a label-efficient semi-supervised fine-tuning method for compact Vision Language Models (VLMs) using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to leverage unlabeled product listings, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning of VLMs is costly due to annotation expenses, prompting the need for label-efficient methods.

Method: Uses PEFT for initial training with labeled data, then DPO with unlabeled data by generating reasoning chains and segregating them into preferred/dispreferred sets for iterative fine-tuning.

Result: DPO-based fine-tuning outperforms supervised models and improves with more unlabeled data.

Conclusion: The method efficiently leverages unlabeled data for better performance, demonstrating scalability and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled

*Matthew Drexler,Benjamin Risk,James J Lah,Suprateek Kundu,Deqiang Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepJIVE is a deep-learning method for multimodal data analysis, overcoming limitations of conventional methods by handling high-dimensional data and identifying nonlinear structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods fail with high-dimensional data and nonlinear structures, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: DeepJIVE uses deep learning to perform Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE), with mathematical derivations and experimental validations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: DeepJIVE successfully uncovers joint and individual variations in multimodal data, including biologically plausible patterns in Alzheimer's disease imaging.

Conclusion: DeepJIVE is a promising tool for multimodal data analysis.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

*Haichuan Li,Tomi Westerlund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Win is a BEV perception framework for autonomous navigation, integrating point cloud encoding and parallel window-based feature extraction for multi-modality understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate perception in urban environments is critical for safe autonomous navigation, requiring methods that handle multi-modality and fine-grained scene decomposition.

Method: Uses a hierarchical architecture with a specialized encoder, window-based backbone, and query-based decoder, incorporating variational approaches and mask-based instance segmentation.

Result: Produces data-consistent, contextually relevant masks and interpretable instance predictions, enhancing autonomous driving decision-making.

Conclusion: Co-Win effectively addresses multi-modality in environmental understanding, improving scene decomposition and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

### [93] [Bias Analysis for Synthetic Face Detection: A Case Study of the Impact of Facial Attribute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19705)
*Asmae Lamsaf,Lucia Cascone,Hugo Proen√ßa,Jo√£o Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in synthetic face detectors, proposing an evaluation framework to analyze bias across facial attributes using synthetic data. It highlights biases in state-of-the-art detectors and explores their origins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic face detectors and datasets may exhibit biases, causing detection failures for certain demographic groups, raising ethical and legal concerns.

Method: An evaluation framework using synthetic data with evenly distributed attributes is introduced to mitigate skew. Five state-of-the-art detectors are analyzed for bias across 25 facial attributes.

Result: Synthetic face detectors are biased toward specific facial attributes. The study traces these biases to training data imbalances and detector activation patterns.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies and analyzes bias in synthetic face detectors, emphasizing the need for balanced training data to mitigate bias.

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

*Liyang Wang,Shiqian Wu,Shun Fang,Qile Zhu,Jiaxin Wu,Sos Again*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces uQRPCA+, a method for moving target detection and background recovery in color videos, reducing computational costs and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and inefficiencies of existing methods like QRPCA and QSVD in processing color videos for moving target detection and background recovery.

Method: Proposes uQRPCA and uQRPCA+ frameworks, leveraging quaternion Riemannian manifolds and the CR1B method to reduce complexity and improve performance.

Result: uQRPCA+ achieves SOTA performance in moving target detection and background recovery tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed uQRPCA+ framework is efficient and effective, outperforming existing methods, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

*Jinsu Yoo,Sooyoung Jeon,Zanming Huang,Tai-Yu Pan,Wei-Lun Chao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAFT-Stereo, a method to improve stereo matching accuracy by integrating LiDAR depth into RAFT-Stereo, addressing challenges with sparse LiDAR data through interpolation and early fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance stereo matching accuracy by leveraging LiDAR depth, especially under sparse LiDAR conditions, where traditional methods degrade.

Method: Proposes pre-filling sparse LiDAR depth maps with interpolation and early fusion of LiDAR depth into image features, leading to the GRAFT-Stereo framework.

Result: GRAFT-Stereo outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods in sparse LiDAR scenarios across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and solutions for effective LiDAR-guided stereo matching, encouraging further research in this direction.

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance long-term instance tracking and identity consistency in video instance segmentation (VIS) by addressing challenges like dynamic scenes and frequent object appearances/disappearances.

Method: Uses Latest Object Memory (LOM) to track and update object states, and Decoupled Object Association (DOA) to separately manage new and existing objects, improving matching accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art AP score of 54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: LOMM sets a new benchmark in VIS by improving tracking consistency and identity management, especially in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

*Jiaxin Liu,Qichao Ying,Zhenxing Qian,Sheng Li,Runqi Zhang,Jian Liu,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel task to recover original faces from retouched images, proposing MoFRR, a mixture of diffusion models, to address diverse retouching types effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authenticity of face images on social media is compromised by retouching, but existing methods only detect retouching, not restore original faces.

Method: Proposes MoFRR, a mixture of diffusion models with specialized experts for distinct retouching types and a shared expert for universal traces, using dual-branch structures for low- and high-frequency restoration.

Result: MoFRR demonstrates effectiveness on the RetouchingFFHQ++ dataset, successfully restoring original faces from retouched images.

Conclusion: MoFRR advances the FRR task by handling diverse retouching operations and outperforms existing methods, contributing to image authenticity.

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes MAE's learning process, revealing it learns patch-level clustering early. A self-guided MAE is proposed, improving learning without external aids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what and how MAE learns and enhance its self-supervised learning process.

Method: Proposes a self-guided MAE that generates informed masks using patch clustering insights, replacing random masking.

Result: The method significantly improves learning efficiency and performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The self-guided MAE enhances MAE's learning while maintaining its self-supervised nature, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: HydraMamba introduces a state space model-based point cloud network with shuffle serialization and ConvBiS6 for better long-range and local dependency modeling, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention-based point cloud learning methods suffer from quadratic complexity and limited inter-point interactions, while state space models like S6 lack proper serialization and locality learning.

Method: HydraMamba uses shuffle serialization for unordered point sets, ConvBiS6 for local and global dependencies, and MHS6 (multi-head S6) for enhanced modeling.

Result: HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on object-level and scene-level tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HydraMamba effectively addresses serialization and locality challenges in point cloud learning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JDATT is a joint distillation framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation and target detection, combining feature-level and output-level distillation to reduce model complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and high computational costs of current deep learning-based AT mitigation methods, especially for real-time applications in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Proposes JDATT, integrating AT mitigation and detection modules with a unified knowledge distillation strategy (CWD, MGD, and KL divergence).

Result: JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and detection accuracy with reduced model size and inference time.

Conclusion: JDATT is effective for real-time deployment, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFlow uses pre-trained video diffusion models to generate realistic motion data for video salient object detection (SOD), improving performance by leveraging semantic motion priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training video SOD models is limited by scarce video datasets and unrealistic synthetic motion data from static images.

Method: TransFlow transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images.

Result: The method achieves improved performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: TransFlow effectively transfers motion knowledge to enhance video SOD training.

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

TL;DR: DepthFlow synthesizes optical flow from single images using depth maps to expand training data for unsupervised video object segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of training data for two-stream VOS models by leveraging structural information in flow maps, which correlates with depth.

Method: Estimates depth maps from images, converts them into synthetic flow fields, and uses these to create training pairs (image-flow-mask).

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all public VOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: DepthFlow provides a scalable solution to data scarcity in VOS, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

TL;DR: The paper explores architectural principles to enhance computer vision models' performance while reducing computational demands, focusing on data handling, neural architecture modifications, and leveraging Normalizing Flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient models in resource-constrained environments drives the research, aiming to balance high performance with reduced computational costs.

Method: Three approaches are used: optimizing data ingress/egress, modifying neural architectures (e.g., restricted attention in vision transformers), and leveraging Normalizing Flows for knowledge distillation.

Result: The proposed methods improve model efficiency, making them smaller, faster, and cheaper without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: Careful architectural design can significantly enhance the efficiency of machine learning models, addressing computational constraints while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

TL;DR: ForCenNet is a novel method for document image rectification that focuses on foreground elements to improve geometric correction, achieving state-of-the-art results on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook foreground elements, which are crucial for geometric references and layout information in document correction.

Method: Proposes a foreground-centric label generation method, a mask mechanism, and a curvature consistency loss to enhance geometric understanding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal, effectively correcting layout elements.

Conclusion: ForCenNet demonstrates the importance of foreground elements in document rectification and provides superior results.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS-Det introduces a flexible Single-Query paradigm to address issues like Recurrent Opposing Interactions (ROT) and query ambiguity in transformer detectors, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoder queries in transformer detectors are predefined and fixed, leading to inefficiencies due to ROT and query ambiguity, which degrade performance.

Method: Proposes DS-Det with a Single-Query paradigm, disentangled attention learning (Cross-Attention for locating, Self-Attention for deduplication), and a unified PoCoo loss for hard samples.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets across five backbone models.

Conclusion: DS-Det effectively resolves ROT and query ambiguity, offering a flexible and efficient solution for object detection.

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

TL;DR: SeeDiff leverages Stable Diffusion's attention mechanisms for pixel-level object classification, avoiding manual annotation by using cross-attention for seeds and self-attention for region expansion, refining masks with background uniformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for laborious pixel-level annotations and pre-trained segmentation networks by fully utilizing Stable Diffusion's capabilities.

Method: Uses cross-attention for coarse seeds and multi-scale self-attention for iterative region expansion, refining masks with background uniformity.

Result: Generates high-quality masks without additional training, prompt tuning, or pre-trained networks.

Conclusion: SeeDiff efficiently produces annotation masks by exploiting Stable Diffusion's attention mechanisms, reducing reliance on human effort and pre-trained models.

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

*Xin Hong,Longchao Da,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-LC, a hierarchical framework for flood mapping in arid regions, improves accuracy by combining multi-class U-Net segmentation, binary expert models, and Bayesian smoothing, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding in arid regions is challenging due to limited spectral contrast and rapid dynamics, requiring accurate mapping for emergency response.

Method: FM-LC uses a three-stage process: multi-class U-Net segmentation, binary expert models for misclassified classes, and Bayesian smoothing for refinement.

Result: Validated on the Dubai 2024 storm, FM-LC improved F1-scores by up to 29% and provided sharper flood delineations.

Conclusion: FM-LC effectively addresses challenges in arid-region flood mapping, offering significant improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

*Yanrui Yu,Tianfei Zhou,Jiaxin Sun,Lianpeng Qiao,Lizhong Ding,Ye Yuan,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lava introduces a language-driven video analytics system for flexible, efficient querying of large-scale video data using natural language, outperforming SQL-based methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SQL-based video analytics systems are rigid and limited to predefined categories, hindering flexible analysis of massive urban video data.

Method: Lava uses a multi-armed bandit for sampling, open-world detection for object retrieval, and trajectory extraction for temporal association.

Result: Lava improves F1-scores by 14%, reduces MPAE by 0.39, achieves 86% top-k precision, and processes videos 9.6√ó faster than baselines.

Conclusion: Lava demonstrates the effectiveness of natural language-driven analytics for scalable, flexible video querying.

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

*Samuel Ebimobowei Johnny,Blessed Guda,Andrew Blayama Stephen,Assane Gueye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer, bypasses traditional alignment methods in CSLR, directly translating pose sequences to text, improving WER by 6.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address error propagation, overfitting, and vocabulary scalability issues in traditional CSLR methods that rely on multi-stage pipelines and alignment mechanisms.

Method: Proposes AutoSign, using a decoder-only transformer with a temporal compression module (1D CNNs) and AraGPT2 for direct pose-to-text translation.

Result: Achieves a 6.1% improvement in WER on the Isharah-1000 dataset, with hand and body gestures identified as most discriminative.

Conclusion: AutoSign outperforms existing methods by eliminating multi-stage pipelines and directly learning textual dependencies.

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

*Wenjie Zhu,Yabin Zhang,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KR-NFT improves OOD detection by separating ID and OOD features using Negative Feature Tuning and knowledge regularization, enhancing generalization and reducing FPR95.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reduced generalization performance of negative prompt tuning in OOD detection for vision-language models.

Method: Proposes KR-NFT, combining Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) for feature separation and knowledge regularization (KR) for optimization. NFT uses distribution-aware transformations and a meta-network for dynamic adaptation.

Result: KR-NFT improves ID classification, OOD detection, and reduces FPR95 by 5.44% with few-shot ImageNet training.

Conclusion: KR-NFT is efficient, scalable, and outperforms traditional methods in OOD detection and generalization.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FineMotion dataset to improve text-driven human motion generation by focusing on detailed body part movements and timing, achieving a +15.3% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating human motions from text often ignore specific body part movements and their timing, limiting realism and detail.

Method: The authors propose the FineMotion dataset with 442,000 motion snippets and 95k detailed descriptions of body part movements, enhancing text-driven motion generation.

Result: Experiments show a +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM model and support zero-shot fine-grained motion editing.

Conclusion: The FineMotion dataset significantly advances fine-grained human motion generation and editing, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

*Ye Lu,Jie Wang,Jianjun Gao,Rui Gong,Chen Cai,Kim-Hui Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMA, a framework for pose-lifting that captures joint dependencies and motion dynamics independently, achieving better results with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods for pose-lifting struggle with modeling intricate joint connections and uniform processing of motion trajectories, ignoring intrinsic motion differences.

Method: SAMA uses a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) for joint feature fusion and a Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM) for tailored motion adjustments.

Result: Experiments show SAMA achieves advanced performance with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: SAMA effectively addresses limitations of prior methods by integrating structure-awareness and motion-adaptivity for pose-lifting.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

*Xiaokai Bai,Chenxu Zhou,Lianqing Zheng,Si-Yuan Cao,Jianan Liu,Xiaohan Zhang,Zhengzhuang Zhang,Hui-liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaGS is a novel framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting to fuse 4D radar and monocular images for 3D object detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fusion methods for 4D radar and monocular images lack holistic scene understanding or suffer from rigid grid structures, limiting 3D object detection performance.

Method: RaGS employs a cascaded pipeline: Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI) for coarse Gaussian positions, Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) for refinement, and Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) for BEV feature rendering.

Result: RaGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes.

Conclusion: RaGS provides a flexible, resource-efficient solution for 3D object detection by dynamically focusing on objects while maintaining scene perception.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OW-CLIP is a system for open-world object detection that addresses data inefficiency, overfitting, and inflexibility through multimodal prompt tuning, Crop-Smoothing, and dual-modal data refinement. It achieves 89% of SOTA performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OWOD methods are data-hungry, prone to overfitting, and inflexible due to architecture changes. OW-CLIP aims to solve these issues.

Method: Uses plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning, Crop-Smoothing, and dual-modal data refinement leveraging LLMs and cross-modal similarity. Includes a visualization interface for annotation.

Result: Achieves 89% of SOTA performance with only 3.8% self-generated data and outperforms SOTA with equivalent data.

Conclusion: OW-CLIP effectively addresses OWOD challenges, offering data-efficient training and high-quality annotations.

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

TL;DR: DiffCode is a novel framework for all-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) that uses a latent diffusion-enhanced vector-quantized codebook prior to handle diverse information losses across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with the heterogeneity and diverse degradations in MedIR tasks, necessitating a unified approach.

Method: DiffCode employs a task-adaptive codebook bank and a latent diffusion strategy to integrate task-specific features and refine prior retrieval.

Result: DiffCode outperforms existing methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality for MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Conclusion: DiffCode effectively addresses the challenges of all-in-one MedIR by leveraging a comprehensive prior and diffusion-based refinement.

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

TL;DR: ATCTrack is a novel vision-language tracker that dynamically aligns multimodal cues with target states for robust tracking in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language trackers struggle with dynamic target states and diverse textual expressions, limiting their effectiveness in real-world conditions.

Method: ATCTrack introduces temporal visual target-context modeling and precise target word identification with context word calibration for adaptive cue utilization.

Result: ATCTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ATCTrack effectively addresses dynamic target-context alignment, enhancing tracking robustness in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Motivation: To enable efficient, stable, and accurate visual-based quadrotor control without relying on explicit geometric models or fiducial markers, addressing numerical instabilities in classical methods.

Method: Combines knowledge distillation from an improved IBVS teacher to a student ConvNet, along with a two-stage segmentation pipeline (YOLOv11 and U-Net) for robust orientation estimation.

Result: The student model achieves 11x faster inference than the teacher, with similar accuracy, and operates efficiently in GPS-denied indoor environments.

Conclusion: The proposed neuro-analytic control method is effective for real-time onboard deployment, offering a lightweight, stable, and accurate solution for quadrotor navigation.

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

Motivation: To explore federated domain generalization's potential in semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, addressing the gap in synthetic-to-real scenarios.

Method: FedS2R includes inconsistency-driven data augmentation for unstable classes and multi-client knowledge distillation with feature fusion.

Result: The global model outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model trained with full data access.

Conclusion: FedS2R effectively addresses synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in federated learning for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

Motivation: Improve object localization in vision-language transformers without the need for retraining.

Method: Reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying mid-level activations.

Result: Improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 VLMs, with gains up to +26.6%.

Conclusion: RCA provides interpretability and performance gains for multimodal transformers.

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current category-specific 3D SOT methods are impractical due to their lack of generalization and need for multiple models. TrackAny3D aims to unify tracking across categories using large-scale pretrained models.

Method: The framework integrates parameter-efficient adapters, a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture, and a temporal context optimization strategy with learnable tokens and dynamic mask weighting.

Result: TrackAny3D outperforms existing methods on three benchmarks, showcasing superior generalization and competitiveness.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of unified models and large-scale pretrained models in advancing 3D SOT, encouraging further research in this direction.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

*Yuxuan Jiang,Chenwei Yu,Zhi Lin,Xiaolan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mini-batch training strategy for deep subspace clustering (DSC) using a memory bank and a decoder-free framework with contrastive learning, achieving scalable training and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DSC methods rely on full-batch processing due to the self-expressive module, limiting scalability for high-resolution images.

Method: Proposes a mini-batch training strategy with a memory bank for global feature preservation and a decoder-free framework using contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to full-batch methods and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COIL100 and ORL datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable DSC training and efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders, offering a practical solution for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

TL;DR: HumanSAM is a framework for classifying human-centric video forgeries into spatial, appearance, and motion anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery types in human-centric videos, which is critical for reliability and interpretability in real-world applications.

Method: HumanSAM fuses video understanding and spatial depth to capture geometry, semantics, and spatiotemporal consistency, using a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy for robust representation.

Result: HumanSAM achieves promising results in binary and multi-class forgery classification, validated on the newly constructed HFV dataset.

Conclusion: HumanSAM advances forgery detection by providing fine-grained classification and robust performance, supported by a comprehensive benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaVesselNet++ is a hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation, combining local and global feature modeling to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of vision transformers while maintaining their ability to capture global contexts in medical image segmentation.

Method: Uses a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) with a texture-aware layer for low-level features and Mamba for long-range dependencies, coupled with a bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder) for accurate segmentation.

Result: Outperforms convolution-based, transformer-based, and Mamba-based methods in 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MambaVesselNet++ effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, making it suitable for real-world medical segmentation applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial control methods for T2I models struggle with complex prompts and multiple objects, leading to inaccurate image generation.

Method: LLM_Control employs a multimodal LLM as a global controller to refine spatial layouts, augment semantics, and bind attributes, injecting control signals into the denoising network.

Result: LLM_Control achieves competitive synthesis quality across various T2I models, outperforming existing methods on challenging inputs.

Conclusion: LLM_Control effectively addresses limitations in controllable T2I generation, offering improved precision for complex spatial compositions.

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCT Depth combines CNNs and Transformers for event-image fusion to improve depth estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in depth estimation with image-based methods (struggle in tough scenarios) and event cameras (sparse data issues) motivate a fusion approach.

Method: Proposes UniCT Depth with CcViT-DA Block (CMSA and MFSA for spatial and cross-modal fusion) and DCC Block for detail enhancement.

Result: UniCT Depth surpasses existing monocular depth estimation methods in key metrics.

Conclusion: The unified CNN-Transformer approach effectively addresses fusion challenges, improving depth estimation performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

TL;DR: AF-CLIP enhances CLIP for visual anomaly detection by focusing on local defects via a lightweight adapter and multi-scale spatial aggregation, achieving strong zero-/few-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual anomaly detection require large training samples and lack focus on local anomalies, limiting their use in zero-/few-shot scenarios.

Method: Introduces AF-CLIP with a lightweight adapter for anomaly-focused visual features, multi-scale spatial aggregation, and learnable textual prompts. Optimized using a composite objective function.

Result: Demonstrates strong zero-shot detection capability and extends to few-shot scenarios with memory banks, showing effectiveness across industrial and medical datasets.

Conclusion: AF-CLIP improves anomaly detection by optimizing visual and textual features, generalizing well in zero-/few-shot settings.

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

TL;DR: A zero-shot method refines point cloud registration using diffusion features from depth images, improving accuracy without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging pretrained diffusion models to enhance semantic correspondences in point cloud registration without needing dedicated datasets.

Method: Projects point clouds into depth maps, extracts diffusion features, integrates them with geometric features for better correspondences.

Result: Significantly improved registration accuracy and robust generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances point cloud registration by combining diffusion and geometric features, demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

Motivation: To improve generalization of encoding models for novel movie stimuli by combining multimodal features and optimizing model architecture.

Method: Leveraged pretrained models (V-JEPA2, Whisper, Llama 3.2, InternVL3, Qwen2.5-Omni), projected features to latent space, aligned temporally, and mapped to cortical parcels using a shared group head and subject-specific residual heads.

Result: Achieved mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on test split, ranking 4th. A last-minute optimization could have improved to 2nd place.

Conclusion: Combining multimodal features with a simple architecture and comprehensive ensembling enhances generalization for encoding models.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our
pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various
state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features

Conclusion: The method simplifies CVD diagnosis, handles real-world artifacts, and is especially useful in resource-limited settings, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely intervention.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,

Motivation: Existing 3D SSG generation methods are computationally intensive and not suitable for real-time applications, prompting the need for a faster, online solution.

Method: FROSS lifts 2D scene graphs to 3D space, representing objects as 3D Gaussian distributions, avoiding intensive point cloud processing.

Result: FROSS achieves superior performance and speed on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG datasets compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: FROSS offers an efficient, real-time solution for 3D SSG generation, with publicly available implementation and dataset.

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-purpose CVD risk assessment method using OCTA images, proposing the VAMPIRE model to improve prediction accuracy by capturing detailed vascular features and analyzing CVD-related conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVD risk assessment methods lack detailed vascular feature analysis and only classify risk as high or low, limiting accuracy and clinical utility.

Method: The VAMPIRE model uses OCTA images with two modules: Mamba-Based Directional (MBD) for vascular trajectory and Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) for vessel morphology.

Result: The method outperforms standard classification backbones, OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances CVD risk assessment by leveraging OCTA images and advanced deep learning, offering improved accuracy and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language contrastive models like CLIP and SigLIP rely on global representations, limiting their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation.

Method: RICE constructs a billion-scale candidate region dataset, uses a Region Transformer layer for regional semantics, and employs a unified region cluster discrimination loss for joint object and OCR learning.

Result: RICE consistently outperforms prior methods on segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception tasks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Conclusion: RICE addresses the limitations of global representations in vision-language models, offering improved performance for dense prediction tasks and releasing pre-trained models for broader use.

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework is proposed for real-time adaptation in streaming data, using dynamic prompts and active querying to improve performance under latency and memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting models in a continuous data stream with single-sample availability, requiring immediate decisions while respecting constraints.

Method: Introduces dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active querying, class-balanced replacement for memory efficiency, and class-aware distribution alignment.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across 10 cross-dataset benchmarks and 4 domain generalization datasets.

Conclusion: The TTAL framework offers a practical solution for real-world deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous systems and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization

while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

### [136] [FaRMamba: Frequency-based learning and Reconstruction aided Mamba for Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20056)
*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba improves medical image segmentation by addressing high-frequency detail loss and spatial degradation through multi-scale frequency transforms and self-supervised reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like blurred lesion boundaries, high-frequency detail loss, and long-range structure modeling hinder accurate medical image segmentation.

Method: FaRMamba introduces a Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM) for high-frequency detail restoration and a Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) for spatial correlation recovery.

Result: FaRMamba outperforms CNN-Transformer hybrids and Mamba variants in boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence.

Conclusion: FaRMamba offers a flexible, frequency-aware framework for medical image segmentation, effectively addressing core challenges.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

### [137] [The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20077)
*Abdelrahman Mohamed,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of VLMs producing short, generic captions due to a bias towards the EOS token during training. It proposes an unsupervised method to reduce this bias, improving caption detail without complex rewards or supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often generate overly generic captions despite strong vision-language capabilities. The authors identify the EOS token bias as a key issue and aim to address it simply.

Method: An unsupervised method to debias the model's premature EOS token prediction, encouraging longer, more detailed captions.

Result: Experiments show increased caption length and detail, though with more hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves caption detail without requiring complex supervision, making it practical for existing models.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

*Shibang Liu,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KB-DMGen improves human image generation by combining Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic Pose Masking to ensure both pose accuracy and overall image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods prioritize pose accuracy but neglect global image quality, prompting the need for a balanced approach.

Method: Proposes KB-DMGen, using a Knowledge Base for pose accuracy and image quality, and Dynamic Masking to adjust pose-related region importance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset.

Conclusion: KB-DMGen effectively balances pose accuracy and image quality, setting a new benchmark in human image generation.

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

### [139] [Local Prompt Adaptation for Style-Consistent Multi-Object Generation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20094)
*Ankit Sanjyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA), a training-free method to improve style uniformity and spatial coherence in text-to-image diffusion models by decomposing prompts into content and style tokens for selective injection into U-Net layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and style specifications, leading to inconsistent visuals.

Method: LPA decomposes prompts into content and style tokens, injecting them selectively into U-Net's attention layers at different stages‚Äîobject tokens early and style tokens later.

Result: LPA outperforms baselines (Composer, MultiDiffusion, etc.) in CLIP score and style consistency on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich prompts.

Conclusion: LPA offers a promising direction for controllable and expressive diffusion-based generation by enhancing layout control and stylistic consistency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

*Haoyue Li,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HDST, a Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network for hyperspectral image denoising, integrating frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling to address spatial-spectral noise coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with hyperspectral images' unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex noise distributions.

Method: HDST combines FFT preprocessing, dynamic cross-domain attention, and hierarchical architecture for 3D spatial, frequency, and channel domain processing.

Result: HDST outperforms existing methods on real and synthetic datasets, maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers new insights for hyperspectral and high-dimensional visual data denoising, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reconstruction-based framework detects medial epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images by learning normal bone structures, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medial epicondyle avulsion, common in baseball players, requires detecting bone discontinuities, which necessitates understanding normal bone structure.

Method: A masked autoencoder-based framework learns normal bone continuity; reconstruction errors highlight avulsion sites.

Result: Achieved pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and image-wise AUC of 0.967, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects avulsion by leveraging normal bone structure learning, with a publicly available dataset.

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

TL;DR: NeuroVoxel-LM integrates NeRF with dynamic voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding to improve 3D scene perception in sparse, large-scale point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D language models struggle with sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited accuracy.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) for adaptive voxel granularity and Token-level Adaptive Pooling for Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) for enhanced semantic representation.

Result: DR-MSV improves feature extraction efficiency and accuracy; TAP-LME outperforms max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics.

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM effectively addresses challenges in 3D scene perception, offering improved efficiency and semantic representation.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework is proposed, integrating adaptive SFM and personalized gait control for realistic and dynamic evacuation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evacuation models lack realism by ignoring complex human behaviors like collisions, interactions, and terrain impacts.

Method: The framework uses a 3D-adaptive SFM Decision Mechanism and Personalized Gait Control Motor, enabling parallel agent movement and dynamic awareness. Part-level Force Visualization is also introduced.

Result: The framework supports dynamic trajectory planning, personalized behavior, and uneven terrain compatibility, producing realistic evacuation visuals.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances crowd simulation realism and plausibility, offering better insights for evacuation analysis.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

TL;DR: Local2Global is an online video instance segmentation framework using local and global queries with a novel L2G-aligner for temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like noise accumulation, drift, occlusions, and scene transitions in online video segmentation to improve temporal consistency.

Method: Uses DETR-based query propagation with local (frame-specific) and global (spatio-temporal) queries, aligned by the L2G-aligner transformer decoder.

Result: Achieves 54.3 AP on Youtube-VIS-19, 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-21, and 37.0 AP on OVIS with ResNet-50.

Conclusion: Local2Global outperforms benchmarks with simple online training, demonstrating effective temporal consistency without complex heuristics.

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the relationship between plant species and disease types, limiting performance. Mo-DsCC addresses this gap.

Method: Mo-DsCC uses a modified VGG-16 backbone, deep supervision, and classification chains to link plant species and disease predictions.

Result: Mo-DsCC outperforms recent approaches in accuracy and F1-score on Plant Village and PlantDoc datasets.

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC is a promising tool for smart agriculture, offering practical benefits and novel insights.

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,
robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance in visible-infrared object detection is limited by misalignments due to resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies.

Method: WMNet uses wavelet-based multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion to align and integrate cross-modal features, addressing noise, illumination variation, and spatial misalignment.

Result: WMNet outperforms on DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets, showing robustness in misaligned cross-modal detection.

Conclusion: WMNet effectively improves alignment and detection accuracy in visible-infrared object detection, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brightness mismatch between enhanced images and ground truth misleads model training, yet is overlooked in current LLIE research.

Method: Introduces GT-mean loss, a probabilistic approach to align image mean values, extending existing loss functions with minimal computational cost.

Result: GT-mean loss consistently improves performance across various methods and datasets.

Conclusion: The GT-mean loss effectively mitigates brightness mismatch, enhancing supervised LLIE model performance.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

TL;DR: A lightweight VLM-based framework for filtering noisy web data to improve vision-language training quality, outperforming larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of maintaining data quality in vision-language models by focusing on curated, high-quality training examples rather than sheer data volume.

Method: Introduces a compact VLM fine-tuned on high-quality image-caption data to evaluate and filter training samples based on quality and alignment, avoiding extra modules.

Result: Datasets filtered by the compact VLM match or exceed the performance of larger, noisier datasets, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method offers a lightweight, robust solution for creating high-quality vision-language training corpora, with tools and data publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\

Conclusion: AnimeColor advances animation colorization and offers a practical solution for industrial applications, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based

fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

Method: The proposed LLM-IAVC includes an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) with a player identification network (PIN) and bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM), plus a visual context learning module (VCLM). These generate multimodal prompts for a large language model (LLM) to produce identity-aware descriptions.

Result: The model outperforms others on the NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 datasets, demonstrating advanced performance.

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC effectively integrates player identities into sports video captions, supported by a new benchmark dataset (NBA-Identity). Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Zeyu1226-mt/LLM-IAVC.

### [152] [PUMPS: Skeleton-Agnostic Point-based Universal Motion Pre-Training for Synthesis in Human Motion Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20170)
*Clinton Ansun Mo,Kun Hu,Chengjiang Long,Dong Yuan,Wan-Chi Siu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PUMPS is an autoencoder for Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) enabling motion synthesis tasks like prediction and interpolation without native dataset supervision, outperforming specialized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion data transfer across skeletons is challenging due to structural differences; TPCs offer compatibility but lack direct motion task learning capabilities.

Method: PUMPS reduces TPCs into feature vectors, uses latent noise for point extraction, and employs linear assignment for reconstruction, avoiding costly attention mechanisms.

Result: PUMPS matches state-of-the-art in pre-training tasks and outperforms specialized methods in fine-tuning for denoising or estimation.

Conclusion: PUMPS provides a generalist yet effective solution for TPC-based motion synthesis, addressing compatibility and learning challenges.

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

*Fei Kong,Jinhao Duan,Kaidi Xu,Zhenhua Guo,Xiaofeng Zhu,Xiaoshuang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spatial evaluation pipeline and benchmark to assess Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on absolute and 3D spatial understanding, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise spatial perception is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, yet VLMs' spatial understanding remains underexplored.

Method: A synthetic dataset is created to evaluate VLMs on absolute spatial positions and 3D spatial movements, with experiments conducted on state-of-the-art models.

Result: Humans perform near-perfectly, while VLMs achieve human-level performance only on simple tasks and near-zero scores on others.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lag significantly in spatial understanding, highlighting the need for improvement in this area.

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

*Yaozong Zheng,Bineng Zhong,Qihua Liang,Shengping Zhang,Guorong Li,Xianxian Li,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A universal video-level tracking model (Modaltracker) with online dense temporal token learning supports multiple tracking tasks (RGB, RGB+Thermal, etc.) using the same architecture and parameters. It focuses on video-level sampling, association, and modality scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified tracking model that handles various modalities (RGB, thermal, depth, event) without requiring separate training for each, reducing complexity and improving efficiency.

Method: The model uses video-level sampling for richer context, dense temporal token association for appearance and motion tracking, and gated perceivers for adaptive cross-modal learning. It employs a one-shot training scheme for multi-task inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on visible and multi-modal benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse tracking tasks.

Conclusion: Modaltracker offers a scalable, efficient solution for multi-modal tracking, leveraging unified architecture and one-shot training to outperform existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

### [155] [MoCTEFuse: Illumination-Gated Mixture of Chiral Transformer Experts for Multi-Level Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20180)
*Li Jinfu,Song Hong,Xia Jianghan,Lin Yucong,Wang Ting,Shao Long,Fan Jingfan,Yang Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCTEFuse is a dynamic multi-level image fusion network that addresses illumination changes in infrared and visible image fusion using an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral Transformer Experts (MoCTE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination changes degrade fusion quality, and existing methods often ignore this, causing modality bias.

Method: Uses MoCTE with high- and low-illumination expert subnetworks, Chiral Transformer Fusion Blocks (CTFB), and a competitive loss function for training.

Result: Achieves superior fusion performance and best detection mAP (70.93% on MFNet, 45.14% on DroneVehicle).

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse effectively balances texture details and object contrasts, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

### [156] [SAMwave: Wavelet-Driven Feature Enrichment for Effective Adaptation of Segment Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20186)
*Saurabh Yadav,Avi Gupta,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMwave improves SAM's performance by using wavelet transforms for richer feature extraction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like SAM degrade in complex tasks; current adapter-based fine-tuning lacks effective feature extraction.

Method: SAMwave uses wavelet transforms and complex-valued adapters to extract multi-scale high-frequency features.

Result: SAMwave outperforms existing methods on four low-level vision tasks, showing efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: SAMwave is a superior, interpretable method for adapting SAM to complex tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

TL;DR: SAViL-Det is a semantic-aware vision-language model for multi-script text detection, integrating textual prompts with visual features using CLIP and AFPN, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic context for diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped text in natural scenes.

Method: Combines CLIP and AFPN with a language-vision decoder for cross-modal attention and text-to-pixel contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves F-scores of 84.8% on MLT-2019 and 90.2% on CTW1500.

Conclusion: SAViL-Det effectively integrates semantic and visual features for superior text detection.

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model
that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual
prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model
combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale
visual feature fusion. The core of the proposed framework is a novel
language-vision decoder that adaptively propagates fine-grained semantic
information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention.
Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark
multi-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates computer vision methods for classifying facial expressions in sign language, focusing on upper/lower face recognition and color normalization. Results show high accuracy (83.8%) and better performance on lower face expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well computer vision can classify facial expressions in sign language and explore differences in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf individuals.

Method: The approach includes color normalization (histogram equalization and fine-tuning) and experiments with upper/lower face recognition.

Result: Achieved 83.8% mean sensitivity with low variance. Lower face recognition (79.6%) outperformed upper face (77.9%), surpassing human accuracy for upper face.

Conclusion: Computer vision effectively classifies facial expressions in sign language, with lower face recognition being more accurate, and outperforms humans for upper face recognition.

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision
methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset.
We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on multimodal long context token compression, categorizing methods by modality (image, video, audio) and mechanism, aiming to reduce computational challenges in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational bottlenecks in MLLMs caused by quadratic complexity of self-attention with long multimodal inputs.

Method: Systematic categorization of token compression approaches by modality (image, video, audio) and underlying mechanisms (transformation, similarity, attention, query-based).

Result: Provides a structured overview of existing methods, highlights challenges, and suggests future research directions.

Conclusion: The survey consolidates progress, identifies challenges, and aims to inspire further advancements in multimodal token compression.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

TL;DR: A dual-branch fusion model for mining area scene classification achieves 83.63% accuracy by combining global and local features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate scene classification in mining areas aids geological monitoring and resource planning, but complex spatial layouts and multi-scale features pose challenges.

Method: Proposes a dual-branch model with a global transformer branch, local enhancement branch, and deep feature fusion module, using multi-loss computation.

Result: Achieves 83.63% accuracy, outperforming other models across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The model effectively integrates multi-scale and local features for superior mining area classification.

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: MECo is a framework for co-speech gesture generation using LLMs, preserving motion-example details while aligning with speech. It outperforms existing methods in FGD, diversity, and similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gesture generation systems lose rich motion details due to reliance on predefined labels or pseudo-labels. MECo aims to retain these details by leveraging LLMs.

Method: MECo fine-tunes LLMs to interpret speech audio and motion examples, using explicit query contexts for gesture synthesis. It supports diverse inputs like motion clips, poses, videos, and text.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in FGD, motion diversity, and example-gesture similarity. Enables granular body part control.

Conclusion: MECo advances gesture generation by preserving motion details and offering flexible input modalities, validated by superior metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing methods in fully exploiting temporal information and computational efficiency for HD map construction in autonomous driving.

Method: Incorporates a memory bank for historical frame data, dynamic BEV feature updates, and a gating mechanism for selective integration. Introduces multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning for enhanced feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: MambaMap effectively addresses challenges in temporal modeling for HD maps, offering a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a global-to-local densification strategy and an energy-guided training framework to improve the efficiency and performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training process of GS suffers from slow convergence due to inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives.

Method: A global-to-local densification strategy and an energy-guided coarse-to-fine multi-resolution training framework are introduced, along with dynamic pruning of unnecessary primitives.

Result: The approach achieves over 2x training speedup with fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of GS-based scene reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

TL;DR: AnimalClue is a large-scale dataset for species identification from indirect evidence like footprints and feces, addressing gaps in wildlife monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on direct visual features, leaving indirect evidence underexplored despite its importance in biodiversity conservation.

Method: The dataset includes 159,605 bounding boxes of indirect clues (footprints, feces, etc.) across 968 species, annotated with species-level labels and fine-grained traits.

Result: The dataset presents unique challenges for vision models due to subtle visual features, and experiments evaluate these challenges.

Conclusion: AnimalClue fills a critical gap in wildlife monitoring and provides a resource for advancing species identification from indirect evidence.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: MIRepNet is a specialized EEG foundation model for motor imagery (MI) paradigms, combining neurophysiological preprocessing and hybrid pretraining for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized EEG models overlook paradigm-specific neurophysiological distinctions, limiting their effectiveness in practical BCI applications like MI.

Method: MIRepNet uses a neurophysiologically-informed preprocessing pipeline and hybrid pretraining (self-supervised and supervised) for rapid adaptation to MI tasks.

Result: MIRepNet outperforms specialized and generalized EEG models across five public MI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MIRepNet is a highly effective EEG foundation model for MI paradigms, offering better generalization and performance with minimal data.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

*Mitul Goswami,Mrinal Goswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-MCAT is a transformer-based framework for efficient remote sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal data, achieving high accuracy with minimal labels and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of label-efficient classification in remote sensing using unpaired multimodal satellite data.

Method: Introduces Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) and Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA) for embedding and aligning heterogeneous modalities without labels.

Result: Achieves 95.4% accuracy on SEN12MS with 20 labels per class, outperforming baselines with fewer parameters and FLOPs, and maintains robustness under spatial misalignment.

Conclusion: L-MCAT is a highly efficient and robust solution for remote sensing classification, suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%
spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The
model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

### [167] [Controllable Feature Whitening for Hyperparameter-Free Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20284)
*Yooshin Cho,Hanbyel Cho,Janghyeon Lee,HyeongGwon Hong,Jaesung Ahn,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework called controllable feature whitening to mitigate bias in deep neural networks by eliminating linear correlations between features, improving reliability without adversarial learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the susceptibility of deep neural networks to spurious correlations in datasets to enhance trustworthy AI.

Method: Quantifies and removes linear correlations between target and bias features using a covariance matrix and whitening module.

Result: Effectively mitigates bias, handles fairness criteria (demographic parity and equalized odds), and outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method offers a stable, effective solution for bias mitigation and fairness in AI, balancing utility and fairness.

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

*Liyuan Zhang,Zeyun Cheng,Yan Yang,Yong Liu,Jinke Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes T$^3$SVFND, a fake news video detection framework using Test-Time Training (TTT) to address distribution shifts in emergency news. It includes a self-supervised MLM task for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detection methods fail to generalize due to distribution shifts, especially in emergencies.

Method: Uses TTT with a self-supervised MLM task masking words and predicting them using multimodal (audio/video) context.

Result: Effective on public benchmarks, particularly for emergency news detection.

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND improves robustness in fake news video detection, especially for emergencies.

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

### [169] [Fine-structure Preserved Real-world Image Super-resolution via Transfer VAE Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20291)
*Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Yuhui Wu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to improve fine-structure preservation in Real-ISR using pre-trained SD models, reducing computational cost while enhancing detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SD-based methods for Real-ISR struggle with fine-structure reconstruction due to aggressive VAE downsampling. Adapting VAE for lower downsampling rates without disrupting pre-trained UNet compatibility is challenging.

Method: The TVT strategy trains a 4√ó decoder from original VAE encoder features, then trains a 4√ó encoder with the fixed decoder. A compact VAE and efficient UNet are introduced to reduce computational costs.

Result: TVT improves fine-structure preservation (e.g., small characters, textures) and requires fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Conclusion: The TVT method effectively addresses fine-structure loss in SD-based Real-ISR, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

### [170] [SWIFT: A General Sensitive Weight Identification Framework for Fast Sensor-Transfer Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20311)
*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT is a fast, unsupervised framework for cross-sensor pansharpening adaptation, reducing adaptation time significantly while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based pansharpening models degrade in performance for unseen sensors, and full retraining is impractical.

Method: SWIFT uses unsupervised sampling to select 3% of target domain samples, identifies sensitive weights via gradient analysis, and updates only those weights.

Result: SWIFT reduces adaptation time to ~1 minute, outperforms direct-transfer baselines, and matches/surpasses full retraining on WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

Conclusion: SWIFT is an efficient, plug-and-play solution for cross-sensor pansharpening, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid pipeline combining 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and 2D diffusion models for realistic and temporally consistent 3D object insertion in videos, demonstrated with bracelet insertion in dynamic wrist scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of achieving both temporal consistency and realistic lighting in 3D object insertion for videos, especially in dynamic scenarios with complex motion and illumination changes.

Method: Uses 3DGS for initial rendering to ensure temporal coherence, then refines with a 2D diffusion model for photorealistic lighting. Introduces a shading-driven pipeline to separate and refine intrinsic object properties.

Result: A robust solution for realistic and consistent video editing, synergizing 3D rendering and 2D diffusion.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines the strengths of 3D and 2D methods, offering a novel solution for video object insertion.

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

TL;DR: PIVOTS introduces a neural network for non-rigid registration in liver surgery, using point clouds to predict deformation, outperforming baselines in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical navigation in laparoscopic liver surgery by accurately predicting liver deformation despite challenges like noise, large deformations, and limited visibility.

Method: Uses a neural network with a geometric feature extraction encoder and deformation-aware cross-attention decoder, trained on synthetic biomechanical data.

Result: Superior registration performance, robustness against noise and deformation, validated on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: PIVOTS advances liver registration methods, with publicly available code and datasets for fair comparison.

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR, categorizes them, creates a dataset (AR-VIM), and proposes a detection framework (VIM-Sense) with high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR's virtual content can mislead users through subtle manipulations, necessitating detection methods.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy for VIM attacks, builds the AR-VIM dataset, and develops VIM-Sense, a multimodal framework combining VLMs and OCR.

Result: VIM-Sense achieves 88.94% detection accuracy and ~7-second latency in tests.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects VIM attacks, outperforming baselines, and is practical for real-world AR applications.

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari,Ali chemsa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-FBP, a two-stage framework using a Diffusion Transformer for Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP), outperforming existing methods with a PCC of 0.932.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with feature alignment for aesthetic assessment due to their reliance on generic pre-training.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) Pre-train a Diffusion Transformer on FFHQ via self-supervised denoising. 2) Use the frozen encoder for feature extraction, fine-tuning only a lightweight regression head on FBP5500.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art PCC of 0.932 on FBP5500, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: Generative pre-training is key for superior feature representation in subjective visual tasks like FBP.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MagicAnime, a large-scale multimodal dataset for cartoon animation, addressing challenges like domain gaps and scarce data. It includes benchmarks for tasks like video and audio-driven animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of cartoon animation, scarcity of annotated data, and the gap between real-world videos and stylized animations motivate the creation of MagicAnime.

Method: Proposes MagicAnime, a dataset with 400k video clips for image-to-video, 50k for whole-body annotation, 12k for face animation, and 2.9k for audio-driven tasks, alongside benchmarks (MagicAnime-Bench).

Result: Validates effectiveness in high-fidelity, fine-grained, and controllable generation across four tasks.

Conclusion: MagicAnime bridges the domain gap and supports diverse cartoon animation tasks, offering a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ModalFormer is a multimodal framework for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) that leverages nine auxiliary modalities and a Cross-modal Transformer (CM-T) with a novel Cross-modal Multi-headed Self-Attention (CM-MSA) mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light images suffer from noise, detail loss, and poor contrast. Existing methods focus on RGB transformations, ignoring contextual information from other modalities.

Method: ModalFormer integrates nine auxiliary modalities using CM-T and CM-MSA to fuse RGB data with features like deep embeddings, segmentation, geometry, and color. Auxiliary subnetworks aid multimodal feature reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show ModalFormer outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ModalFormer sets a new standard for LLIE by effectively utilizing multimodal data, with pre-trained models and results publicly available.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex driving scenarios in unstructured environments like India is critical for autonomous vehicle development.

Method: Five deep learning models (UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet, SegNet) were trained and evaluated using Mean Intersection over Union (MIOU) on the Indian Driving Dataset.

Result: UNET+RESNET50 achieved the highest MIOU of 0.6496, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in challenging environments and provides insights for future autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D annotation is costly and slow; LiDAR-based autolabeling lacks semantic granularity and struggles with data limitations.

Method: VESPA fuses LiDAR's geometric precision with camera's semantic richness, leveraging vision-language models for open-vocabulary labeling.

Result: Achieves 52.95% AP for object discovery and 46.54% for multiclass detection on Nuscenes.

Conclusion: VESPA offers scalable, high-quality 3D autolabeling without ground truth, advancing autonomous driving data annotation.

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.

*Dinh Nam Pham,Eleftherios Avramidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of non-manual facial features (eyes, mouth, full face) in automatic sign language recognition (ASLR) using deep learning models, finding the mouth to be the most impactful feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-manual facial features are crucial in sign language but underexplored in ASLR. Prior work lacks systematic analysis of distinct facial regions.

Method: Two deep learning models (CNN-based and transformer-based) are trained on an SLR dataset to evaluate the impact of facial regions (eyes, mouth, full face).

Result: The mouth is identified as the most important non-manual feature, significantly improving recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: Facial features, especially the mouth, are essential for ASLR and should be incorporated in future systems.

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings

Abstract: This work summarises and reports the results of the second Presentation
Attack Detection competition on ID cards. This new version includes new
elements compared to the previous one. (1) An automatic evaluation platform was
enabled for automatic benchmarking; (2) Two tracks were proposed in order to
evaluate algorithms and datasets, respectively; and (3) A new ID card dataset
was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,
respectively. These results suggest that PAD on ID cards is improving, but it

*Rajat Singhal,Jatin Gupta,Akhil Sharma,Anushka Gupta,Navya Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) detection and translation system using a CNN, achieving 99.95% accuracy to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and mute in India.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deaf and mute communities face communication barriers due to a lack of skilled interpreters and accessible technologies, especially in India where ISL solutions are underdeveloped.

Method: A CNN-based model trained on an ISL dataset, integrated with MediaPipe for hand tracking and motion detection, is developed for real-time translation.

Result: The model achieves 99.95% classification accuracy, demonstrating high precision in discerning nuanced sign features.

Conclusion: The system effectively addresses communication challenges for deaf and mute individuals in India, showcasing potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes $A^2R^2$, a framework for improving Img2LaTeX conversion using attention-guided refinement and visual reasoning, outperforming baselines on a new challenging dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs underperform in Img2LaTeX tasks due to struggles with fine-grained visual elements, prompting the need for a self-correcting framework.

Method: $A^2R^2$ integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework for progressive prediction improvement.

Result: $A^2R^2$ outperforms baselines across six metrics, benefits from more inference rounds, and shows strong synergy in ablation studies.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances Img2LaTeX conversion, validated by experiments and human evaluations, with potential for test-time scaling.

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

### [183] [Can Foundation Models Predict Fitness for Duty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20418)
*Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using deep learning and foundational models to predict fitness for duty (alertness) from biometric iris images, addressing challenges in dataset creation for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the use of biometric devices beyond recognition by estimating alertness, despite the difficulty in gathering large datasets for training.

Method: Utilizes deep learning and foundational models, leveraging self-supervised learning for generalization with limited data.

Result: Proposes a solution to enhance fitness-for-duty prediction by overcoming dataset scarcity through foundational models.

Conclusion: Foundational models offer a promising approach to improve alertness prediction in fitness-for-duty assessments.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

*Sungjoon Park,Minsik Park,Haneol Lee,Jaesub Yun,Donggeon Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a joint learning approach for 3D face reconstruction and talking head synthesis, improving facial expression representation and lip-sync quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance talking head synthesis by optimizing facial expression representation and addressing issues like flickering in lip-sync.

Method: Jointly learns 3D face reconstruction and talking head synthesis, using a FACS-based blendshape representation and a novel lip-sync pipeline.

Result: Improved quality of generated faces and reduced flickering in lip-sync by decoupling chin contours.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms previous methods by optimizing facial expressions and refining lip-sync techniques.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

### [185] [Frequency-Aware Autoregressive Modeling for Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20454)
*Zhuokun Chen,Jugang Fan,Zhuowei Yu,Bohan Zhuang,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseVAR is a plug-and-play framework that accelerates next-scale prediction in visual autoregressive modeling by dynamically excluding low-frequency tokens during inference, reducing computational cost without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational overhead in high-resolution stages of visual autoregressive modeling is a challenge due to the large number of tokens. Low-frequency tokens have minimal impact on image quality and exhibit similarity with neighbors.

Method: SparseVAR uses lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify and exclude low-frequency tokens, preserving fidelity with anchor tokens. It leverages the observation that different model blocks focus on distinct regions.

Result: SparseVAR achieves up to a 2x speedup with minimal quality degradation in models like Infinity-2B.

Conclusion: SparseVAR effectively balances computational efficiency and image quality, making it a practical solution for accelerating high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

*Sungrae Hong,Kyungeun Kim,Juhyeon Kim,Sol Lee,Jisu Shin,Chanjae Song,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new MIL method addresses priority issues in clinical diagnosis by using vertical and horizontal hierarchies, improving accuracy and symptom prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL approaches ignore priority among pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Proposes a method with vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy to align predictions and prioritize serious classes.

Result: Reduces misdiagnosis and effectively prioritizes important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.

Conclusion: The method enhances MIL for clinical use by addressing priority issues and validating performance on real-world data.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

*Shiyang Liu,Dianyi Yang,Yu Gao,Bohan Ren,Yi Yang,Mengyin Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method for aligning and fusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) sub-maps, improving registration accuracy and fusion quality without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D-GS sub-map registration and fusion rely on manual intervention and rigid thresholding, leading to degraded rendering quality. The paper aims to automate this process while enhancing accuracy and preserving scene structure.

Method: The approach involves extracting geometric skeletons and using ellipsoid-aware convolution for robust registration, followed by a multi-factor Gaussian fusion strategy to reduce scene element loss.

Result: The method reduces RRE by 41.9% for registration and improves PSNR by 10.11 dB for fusion, demonstrating superior performance in complex scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances 3D scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, benefiting robotic perception and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

*Beizhang Chen,Jinming Liang,Zheng Xiong,Ming Pan,Xiangbao Meng,Qingshan Lin,Qun Ma,Yingping Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved YOLOv8 model for detecting rice spikelet flowering, enhancing accuracy and speed for hybrid rice seed production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of rice flowering time is vital for efficient pollination and higher yields, but current methods struggle with small spikelets and complex field conditions.

Method: The study improves YOLOv8 by replacing PANet with BiFPN for better feature fusion and adding a p2 detection head for small objects. A dedicated dataset is created using high-resolution RGB cameras and augmentation.

Result: The improved YOLOv8s-p2 achieves 65.9% mAP@0.5, 67.6% precision, 61.5% recall, and 64.41% F1-score, with a speed of 69 f/s.

Conclusion: The model provides an effective, high-accuracy solution for automated monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

*Behzad Vahedi,Rafael Pires de Lima,Sepideh Jalayer,Walter N. Meier,Andrew P. Barrett,Morteza Karimzadeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how spatial context impacts sea ice segmentation using a multi-task model, finding optimal receptive field sizes for different data types and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the optimal spatial context for sea ice segmentation is underexplored, especially for multi-task mapping with varying data resolutions.

Method: The study uses Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with varying atrous rates to control receptive field size and capture multi-scale context, testing on Sentinel-1 SAR and AMSR2 data.

Result: Smaller receptive fields work best for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, medium fields for stage of development, and SAR-AMSR2 fusion improves all tasks.

Conclusion: Appropriate spatial context selection based on data resolution and task is crucial for optimizing deep learning in geospatial applications.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

*Wei Zhuo,Runjie Luo,Wufeng Xue,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BCT-CLIP, a novel Few-Shot Learning method that leverages dominating properties via contrastive learning and LLM-based prior knowledge to improve discriminative representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of data scarcity in Few-Shot Learning (FSL) by moving beyond simple class token alignment to capture visual diversity.

Method: Introduces a multi-property generator (MPG), LLM-assisted retrieval with clustering-based pruning, and a contrastive learning strategy for property-token learning.

Result: Superior performance on 11 datasets, demonstrating improved discriminative class-specific representation and few-shot classification.

Conclusion: Exploring dominating properties enhances FSL by combining global category and patch-aware property embeddings.

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

TL;DR: A 3D Gaussian splatting framework for outdoor relighting using intrinsic image decomposition to handle sunlight, sky radiance, and indirect lighting, enabling diverse shading and dynamic shadows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods compress global illumination into a single latent vector, limiting shading manipulation and shadow effects. This work aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Uses residual-based sun visibility extraction, region-based supervision with structural consistency loss, and ray-tracing for shadow simulation.

Result: Synthesizes novel views with high fidelity and produces natural, multifaceted illumination and shadows.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art relighting solutions in realism and flexibility.

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

*Yili Li,Gang Xiong,Gaopeng Gou,Xiangyan Qu,Jiamin Zhuang,Zhen Li,Junzheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VParser improves text-to-video retrieval by extracting multiview semantic representations for adaptive alignment, addressing partial misalignment in video-text datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align entire video-text representations, ignoring inequivalence due to richer video content than text descriptions.

Method: Proposes T2VParser with Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for cross-modal content decomposition and adaptive semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves accurate partial alignment, outperforming direct alignment methods.

Conclusion: T2VParser effectively aligns text and video while leveraging pretrained model knowledge.

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the

Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning, a key capability for VQA and robotics, despite rapid advancements.

Method: SpatialVTS trains models to generate location-specific tokens (visual thinking) and infer answers through long-term textual thinking, supported by dataset corrections and logical reasoning details.

Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

*Davy Rojas Yana,Edwin Salcedo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic grain classification system for green lentils using computer vision and pneumatic ejection achieves 87.2% accuracy in separating defective grains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve grain sorting efficiency and accuracy using low-cost, modular technology.

Method: Uses a two-stage YOLOv8 pipeline for detection and classification, combined with a pneumatic ejection mechanism and Arduino-based control.

Result: Operates at 59 mm/s with 87.2% separation accuracy, though processing rate is limited to 8 g/min.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a foundation for future enhancements.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic
grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

### [196] [T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536)
*Chieh-Yun Chen,Min Shi,Gong Zhang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-Copilot is a training-free multi-agent system that automates prompt engineering, model selection, and refinement for text-to-image generation, improving quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models are sensitive to prompt phrasing and lack clear feedback, requiring iterative refinement. Existing solutions offer limited controllability or need additional training.

Method: T2I-Copilot uses three agents: Input Interpreter for prompt parsing, Generation Engine for model selection, and Quality Evaluator for feedback. It operates autonomously or with human intervention.

Result: T2I-Copilot matches commercial models in VQA scores, surpasses others in performance, and reduces costs significantly.

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot simplifies prompt engineering, enhances generation quality, and offers cost-effective performance without additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

### [197] [Annotation-Free Human Sketch Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20548)
*Lan Yang,Kaiyue Pang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (GACL) to assess sketch quality using feature magnitude as a metric, validated by human studies, and extends to natural images and noisy label cleansing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of sketch quality assessment is unexplored, and the paper aims to quantify it without human annotations.

Method: Proposes Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a dual-task framework optimizing feature magnitude and recognizability under cross-entropy loss.

Result: GACL aligns with human perception (160,000 trials) and enables practical sketch applications, extending to natural images and noisy label cleansing.

Conclusion: GACL is a versatile, annotation-free quality metric with broad applications, including sketch and image quality assessment.

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

### [198] [FED-PsyAU: Privacy-Preserving Micro-Expression Recognition via Psychological AU Coordination and Dynamic Facial Motion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20557)
*Jingting Li,Yu Qian,Lin Zhao,Su-Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FED-PsyAU, a framework combining psychological priors and federated learning to improve micro-expression recognition (MER) while addressing privacy and data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions (MEs) reveal concealed emotions but face challenges like small datasets, subtle features, and privacy concerns in real-world applications.

Method: The FED-PsyAU framework integrates psychological studies on facial action units (AUs) with a DPK-GAT network for hierarchical feature learning. Federated learning is used to enhance MER across clients without data sharing.

Result: Experiments on standard ME databases confirm the framework's effectiveness in improving MER performance.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses MER challenges by leveraging psychological insights and federated learning, ensuring privacy and scalability.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemoryTalker synthesizes realistic 3D facial animations from audio without needing priors like labels or meshes, focusing on speaking styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods require additional priors, limiting practicality and failing to capture speaking styles.

Method: MemoryTalker uses a two-stage framework: memorizing general motion and animating with audio-driven style features.

Result: The model generates personalized facial animations without extra priors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MemoryTalker enhances realistic facial animation by focusing on speaking styles, improving usability and performance.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

### [200] [Learning Phonetic Context-Dependent Viseme for Enhancing Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20568)
*Hyung Kyu Kim,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phonetic context-aware loss for speech-driven 3D facial animation to improve motion continuity and reduce jittery outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional frame-wise methods fail to capture facial motion continuity, leading to unnatural animations due to coarticulation.

Method: Introduces a phonetic context-aware loss with viseme coarticulation weights to adaptively prioritize facial movements over time.

Result: Experiments show improved quantitative metrics and visual quality compared to conventional reconstruction loss.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes is key for natural speech-driven 3D facial animation.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

*Yanyin Guo,Runxuan An,Junwei Li,Zhiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSFDNet, a single-stage image fusion detection algorithm combining SWIR and LWIR for ship detection, introducing MLCF and OE loss to enhance performance and object semantics in fused images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-modal methods (visible/infrared) struggle in complex scenarios like varying lighting or fog. SWIR and LWIR offer advantages, but their fusion for detection is underexplored.

Method: LSFDNet integrates feature interaction between fusion and detection tasks, using MLCF for multi-level cross-fusion and OE loss for object semantics. A new dataset (NSLSR) is created for training.

Result: LSFDNet achieves superior detection performance and visually impressive fused images, validated on two datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of single-modal approaches, improving ship detection in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

*Jiacheng Lu,Hui Ding,Shiyu Zhang,Guoping Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-Net, a framework for sequential MRI tumor segmentation, introduces Mesh-Cast and TPS training to leverage spatial correlations between slices, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models underutilize spatial correlations in MRI slices, which resemble temporal data in videos. M-Net aims to bridge this gap.

Method: M-Net uses Mesh-Cast for channel/temporal integration and TPS training for pattern learning and feature refinement, avoiding full 3D convolutions.

Result: M-Net outperforms existing methods on BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets.

Conclusion: M-Net is a robust, temporally-aware solution for MRI tumor segmentation.

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

TL;DR: HYPIR is a novel image restoration method combining pre-trained diffusion models with adversarial training, achieving high-quality results, faster convergence, and user control without iterative sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (MSE-based, GAN-based, diffusion-based) struggle to balance restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. HYPIR aims to address these limitations.

Method: Initializes with a pre-trained diffusion model, fine-tunes via adversarial training, avoiding diffusion loss or iterative sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and speed, with added user control (text-guided restoration, adjustable textures).

Conclusion: HYPIR efficiently balances restoration quality, fidelity, and speed, leveraging diffusion models' strengths while improving adversarial training.

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of detecting sophisticated facial manipulations in digital security, where conventional methods often fail.

Method: Uses a hybrid approach integrating handcrafted frequency-domain features (e.g., SRM, DCT, ELA, SVD, DFT) with RGB inputs to detect manipulation artifacts.

Result: The framework provides richer, more discriminative information for detecting deepfakes.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances detection accuracy by leveraging both frequency and spatial domain artifacts.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake and face swap technologies has raised
significant concerns in digital security, particularly in identity verification

exploits frequency and spatial domain artifacts introduced during image

TL;DR: A lightweight RSSC framework with a distilled GFNet model and early-exit mechanism improves efficiency on edge devices, achieving faster inference and better energy efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing accuracy, latency, and energy consumption for RSSC models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Use frequency domain distillation to reduce GFNet model size and design a dynamic early-exit mechanism for edge DNN models.

Result: Achieves 1.3x speedup in inference, over 40% energy efficiency improvement, and maintains high accuracy across four datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively optimizes RSSC performance for edge devices, balancing speed, energy, and accuracy.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAMS, a dual-path framework for video anomaly detection, combining multiscale spatiotemporal modeling with cross-modal semantic alignment for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video anomaly detection is challenging due to multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and limited labeled data. The study aims to address these issues by integrating hierarchical feature learning and semantic guidance.

Method: DAMS uses a dual-path architecture: one path integrates AMTPN (for multiscale temporal features) and CBAM (for attention-based feature enhancement), while the other leverages CLIP for cross-modal semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DAMS in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: DAMS successfully combines spatiotemporal and semantic features, offering a robust solution for video anomaly detection.

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransPrune is a training-free token pruning method for LVLMs, using Token Transition Variation (TTV) and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA) to improve efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs in LVLMs due to excessive visual tokens, and limitations of existing attention-based pruning methods.

Method: Proposes TransPrune, which assesses token importance via TTV (measuring changes in token representations) and IGA (measuring instruction attention to tokens).

Result: Achieves comparable performance to original LVLMs while reducing inference TFLOPs by over half. TTV alone matches attention-based methods.

Conclusion: TransPrune offers an efficient, training-free solution for token pruning in LVLMs, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

Result: Evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets (VIS30K), showing effectiveness in colormap adjustment and transfer.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully recovers colormaps and generalizes to visualizations with legends or discrete palettes.

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

TL;DR: A multimodal U-Net-based architecture predicts future player locations in multiplayer games, leveraging heterogeneous data and multi-head attention for agent communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting player movement is essential for applications like bot navigation, strategy recommendation, and behavior analytics in complex game environments.

Method: Uses a U-Net-based approach with multimodal feature encoding and multi-head attention to process image inputs, numerical/categorical features, and dynamic game data.

Result: The architecture effectively predicts player locations on a dynamic time horizon, enabling downstream tasks like predictive bot behavior and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The technique provides a foundation for advanced applications relying on future player position predictions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

TL;DR: Estimates camera roll and pitch using minimal scene info (known intrinsics, fixed height, and a reference line).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scenarios where full camera calibration is impractical, offering a lightweight solution for constrained environments.

Method: Uses inverse projection geometry with a single straight reference line and known planar distance, incorporating lens distortion correction.

Result: Provides roll and pitch angle estimation without full calibration.

Conclusion: A practical, lightweight method for orientation estimation in multi-camera systems with limited calibration feasibility.

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

*Haowen Li,Zhenfeng Fan,Zhang Wen,Zhengzhou Zhu,Yunjin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-domain image composition method without text prompts, using efficient backward inversion and forward denoising, outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain image composition is under-explored due to challenges like stochastic diffusion models and style gaps, limiting practical applications.

Method: Uses backward inversion, forward denoising, and a multilayer perceptron with CLIP features and local cross-attention for seamless compositions.

Result: Improves LPIPS by 30.5% and CSD by 18.1%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The method advances cross-domain composition research and applications, with code and benchmark available.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

*Chaowei Chen,Xiang Zhang,Honglie Guo,Shunfang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a style-aware blending and prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework to address deficiencies in weak-strong consistency learning for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook inherent limitations in the weak-strong consistency framework, such as confirmation bias from separated training streams and incomplete use of supervisory information.

Method: The framework includes a style-guided distribution blending module to unify labeled and unlabeled data streams and a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to utilize both weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods on multiple medical segmentation benchmarks in semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the identified deficiencies and improves performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in emotion recognition: incomplete multi-modal signals and movement/artifact interference.

Method: Proposes MMQ-Net with modality, category, and interference queries to handle missing data, focus on emotions, and reduce noise.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, especially with highly incomplete data.

Conclusion: MMQ-Net effectively tackles key challenges in emotion recognition from physiological signals.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health
assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal
signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents
a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from
incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and
interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of
MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data
incompleteness.

### [216] [Implicit Counterfactual Learning for Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20740)
*Mingfeng Zha,Tianyu Li,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yangyang Wu,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an implicit counterfactual framework (ICF) for unbiased audio-visual segmentation, addressing modality gaps and imbalances with multi-granularity implicit text (MIT) and semantic counterfactual (SC) methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVS methods focus on interaction efficiency but neglect modality discrepancies and imbalances, leading to biased cross-modal understanding.

Method: Introduces ICF with MIT (video-, segment-, frame-level text) to bridge modality gaps and SC to learn orthogonal representations. Uses CDCL for contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ICF effectively mitigates modality biases and enhances AVS performance through MIT and SC, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSoRA improves LoRA by reducing redundancy in projection matrices, enhancing feature adaptation without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA variants suffer from high representation redundancy due to unrestricted projection matrices, limiting feature adaptation effectiveness.

Method: ReSoRA decomposes low-rank submatrices into equivalent subspaces and applies de-redundancy constraints to feature distributions.

Result: ReSoRA consistently enhances PETL methods across various datasets and architectures in vision-language retrieval and visual classification.

Conclusion: ReSoRA is a flexible, plug-and-play solution to reduce redundancy in LoRA, improving performance without added inference costs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

*Matan Kichler,Shai Bagon,Mark Sheinin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method uses speckle-based vibration sensing and transformers to infer hidden liquid levels in opaque containers remotely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision can't determine hidden properties like liquid levels in opaque containers. This paper aims to expand vision capabilities by analyzing surface vibrations.

Method: Proposes a speckle-based vibration sensing system to capture 2D grid vibrations. Uses a transformer-based model to classify container type and liquid level, invariant to vibration sources.

Result: The method successfully classifies liquid levels in various containers, generalizing to unseen instances and ambient sound sources.

Conclusion: This approach enables remote, non-invasive inspection of liquid levels in sealed containers, advancing computer vision beyond surface analysis.

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

TL;DR: KASportsFormer, a transformer-based 3D pose estimation framework for sports, improves performance in complex sports scenarios by integrating kinematic anatomy features, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based methods struggle with sports scenarios due to complex movements, motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts, especially in momentary actions like shooting.

Method: Introduces KASportsFormer with Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser (LimbFus) modules to extract and encode kinematic motion information in a multimodal manner.

Result: Achieves MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm on SportsPose and WorldPose datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: KASportsFormer effectively addresses challenges in sports pose estimation, demonstrating superior performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications, addressing the lack of public benchmarks in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a publicly available benchmark for multimodal registration in UAV scenarios limits the development and evaluation of advanced methods.

Method: The dataset includes 7,969 triplets of visible, infrared, and registered visible images, annotated with pixel-level ground truth and imaging condition attributes.

Result: ATR-UMMIM provides diverse scenarios, high-quality annotations, and supports downstream tasks with object-level annotations.

Conclusion: ATR-UMMIM is a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal registration, fusion, and perception in UAV applications.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

TL;DR: RRVF framework reduces reliance on curated image-text supervision for MLLMs by using visual feedback and reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck of MLLMs' heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision for deep visual reasoning.

Method: Introduces RRVF, a framework using "Asymmetry of Verification" principle, reinforcement learning, and a closed-loop process of reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback.

Result: RRVF outperforms open-source MLLMs and supervised fine-tuning baselines in image-to-code generation tasks.

Conclusion: Visual feedback-driven systems like RRVF offer a robust, generalizable path for MLLMs without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available

TL;DR: RingMo-Agent is a unified model for multi-modal and multi-platform RS imagery, leveraging a large-scale dataset (RS-VL3M) and adaptive representations to handle diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS vision-language methods lack versatility for heterogeneous data and complex tasks, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: RingMo-Agent uses modality-specific embeddings, task-specific tokens, and a high-dimensional decoding mechanism for multi-modal and multi-platform data.

Result: The model excels in visual understanding and analytical tasks, showing strong generalizability across platforms and modalities.

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent addresses limitations of current methods, offering a robust framework for diverse RS applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

TL;DR: Synthetic data (FairFaceGen) shows promise for bias mitigation in face recognition but lags in generalization compared to real data. SD35-generated data performs best for fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if synthetic data can achieve high accuracy and fairness in face recognition systems.

Method: Generated balanced synthetic datasets (FairFaceGen) using Flux.1-dev and SD35, combined with identity augmentation methods. Evaluated on standard and challenging benchmarks.

Result: Synthetic data lags in generalization but SD35-generated data shows potential for bias mitigation. Intra-class augmentations impact accuracy and fairness.

Conclusion: Synthetic data, especially SD35-generated, offers practical guidelines for fairer face recognition systems.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

*Pavel Korshunov,Amir Mohammadi,Vidit Vidit,Christophe Ecabert,S√©bastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset, FantasyID, is introduced to improve forged ID detection in KYC applications, challenging current state-of-the-art detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of easy-to-use image generation tools enables malicious actors to create forged IDs, threatening KYC systems, necessitating robust detection solutions.

Method: FantasyID dataset mimics real-world IDs with diverse designs, languages, and real faces, printed and captured to simulate bonafide IDs, and includes digital forgery attacks.

Result: Current detection algorithms (TruFor, MMFusion, etc.) perform poorly on FantasyID, with high false negative rates (close to 50%) at a 10% false positive rate.

Conclusion: FantasyID is a complex and practical benchmark for evaluating and improving forged ID detection algorithms.

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

*Chunshi Wang,Bin Zhao,Shuxue Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), a plug-and-play module for building footprint extraction, enhancing feature extraction in CNNs. SCANet, integrating SCA, outperforms SOTA methods on WHU and Massachusetts datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building footprint extraction is crucial for urban planning and environmental tasks, but existing methods face challenges in feature extraction.

Method: Proposes SCA, a module using dual pooling kernels and split operations for efficient feature extraction, integrated into a CNN (SCANet).

Result: SCANet achieves best IoU scores (91.61% and 75.49%) on WHU and Massachusetts datasets.

Conclusion: SCA and SCANet significantly improve building footprint extraction, offering a robust solution for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional
and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter
significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

### [227] [Rethinking Few Shot CLIP Benchmarks: A Critical Analysis in the Inductive Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20834)
*Alexey Kravets,Da Chen,Vinay P. Namboodiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques current few-shot evaluation methods for CLIP, introduces an unlearning pipeline for true inductive baselines, and proposes an improved few-shot classification technique with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current few-shot evaluations of CLIP are flawed due to partial transductivity, as datasets are often seen by CLIP, masking true inductive generalization.

Method: Proposes an unlearning technique to create true inductive baselines and introduces an improved few-shot classification method.

Result: Performance drops significantly (-55% on average) in the new inductive setting. The proposed method outperforms 13 baselines in 5880 experiments.

Conclusion: The work highlights evaluation flaws in CLIP-based few-shot classification, offers a solution via unlearning, and presents a superior method.

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

### [228] [METEOR: Multi-Encoder Collaborative Token Pruning for Efficient Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20842)
*Yuchen Liu,Yaoming Wang,Bowen Shi,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: METEOR introduces a progressive pruning framework for multi-encoder vision-language models, reducing redundancy and computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-encoder architectures like CLIP struggle with diverse multimodal tasks, and multi-encoder methods are computationally expensive. METEOR aims to balance efficiency and performance.

Method: METEOR uses a three-stage pruning strategy: rank-guided token assignment for encoding, cooperative pruning for fusion, and adaptive pruning for decoding.

Result: METEOR reduces 76% of visual tokens with only a 0.3% performance drop compared to EAGLE, validated on 11 benchmarks.

Conclusion: METEOR successfully achieves an efficient multi-encoder vision-language model, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-stage pruning.

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code
is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.

*Ruoyu Fan,Yuhui Wen,Jiajia Dai,Tao Zhang,Long Zeng,Yong-jin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $S^3$LAM is an RGB-D SLAM system using 2D surfel splatting for efficient and accurate tracking and mapping, outperforming 3D Gaussian-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian-based SLAM systems are less efficient for scene representation. $S^3$LAM aims to improve accuracy and efficiency by focusing on 2D surfels.

Method: Uses 2D Gaussian surfels for scene representation, introduces adaptive surface rendering for real-time optimization, and derives camera pose Jacobians from 2D surfel splatting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, with high-quality geometry reconstruction.

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency in SLAM tasks, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

### [230] [Compositional Video Synthesis by Temporal Object-Centric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20855)
*Adil Kaan Akan,Yucel Yemez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for compositional video synthesis using temporally consistent object-centric representations, improving video generation quality and enabling intuitive editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-centric approaches lack generative capabilities or neglect explicit object-level structure in videos. This work aims to address these gaps.

Method: Leverages pose-invariant object-centric slots and conditions them on pretrained diffusion models for high-quality, coherent video synthesis.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in video generation quality and temporal consistency, with strong segmentation and generative performance.

Conclusion: Advances interactive and controllable video generation, enabling new possibilities for content creation and dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

*Ziling Wu,Armaghan Moemeni,Praminda Caleb-Solly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnionCut introduces a robust foreground prior for unsupervised object discovery, addressing challenges in distinguishing foreground/background and determining undiscovered objects, improving performance in UOD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UOD methods rely on heuristic foreground priors and fixed discovery iterations, leading to inaccuracies. UnionCut aims to provide a more reliable solution.

Method: Proposes UnionCut, a min-cut and ensemble-based foreground prior, and UnionSeg, a distilled transformer for efficient foreground union detection.

Result: Combining UnionCut/UnionSeg with existing UOD methods improves performance in single object discovery, saliency detection, and self-supervised instance segmentation.

Conclusion: UnionCut and UnionSeg enhance UOD by providing a robust foreground prior and efficient detection, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniBrain, a multimodal framework, integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data to improve Alzheimer's diagnosis, achieving high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease demands accurate, scalable diagnostics, but existing methods fail to meet clinical standards for accuracy, generalization, robustness, and explainability simultaneously.

Method: OmniBrain uses a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout to integrate brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data.

Result: It achieves 92.2% accuracy on ANMerge and 70.4% on ADNI, outperforming prior methods. Explainability analyses identify relevant brain regions and genes.

Conclusion: OmniBrain provides a robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of VLMs in autonomous driving, such as myopic decisions and passive perception, to improve reliability in complex environments.

Method: Introduces Hybrid-Thinking (text/tool-based reasoning) and Active Perception with a vision toolkit, trained via three-stage progressive reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, validated by ablation studies showing robust, visually grounded decisions.

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1 advances safer, more intelligent autonomous systems by balancing efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive review of recent deep learning-based endoscopic depth estimation, addressing gaps in existing surveys and aiding researchers.

Method: Systematic review of state-of-the-art literature, categorizing methods by supervision strategies and network architectures, and analyzing datasets and metrics.

Result: A detailed overview of endoscopic depth estimation, including challenges, applications in robot-assisted surgery, and future research directions like domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers, outlining advancements and future opportunities in endoscopic depth estimation.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

### [235] [Event-Based De-Snowing for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20901)
*Manasi Muglikar,Nico Messikommer,Marco Cannici,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event camera-based method for de-snowing images, leveraging snowflakes' distinctive streak signatures in event data. It outperforms traditional methods by 3 dB in PSNR and improves downstream tasks like depth estimation by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather like heavy snowfall challenges vision systems. Traditional methods introduce artifacts or require high frame rates, while camera parameters complicate the problem. Event cameras offer a promising alternative.

Method: An attention-based module focuses on snowflake streaks in event data to recover occluded background points. The method is tested on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset with precise ground truth.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR and improves performance in downstream tasks like depth estimation by 20%.

Conclusion: The method enhances vision system reliability in winter conditions, enabling robust all-weather applications.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCORPION, a dataset for evaluating model reliability under scanner variability in computational pathology, and proposes SimCons, a framework to improve scanner generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scanner-induced variability in Whole-Slide Images is crucial for reliable model performance in real-world clinical settings.

Method: The SCORPION dataset includes 480 tissue samples scanned with 5 scanners, and SimCons combines augmentation-based domain generalization with a consistency loss.

Result: SimCons improves model consistency across scanners without sacrificing task-specific performance.

Conclusion: The SCORPION dataset and SimCons framework advance the evaluation and improvement of model reliability in computational pathology.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMLET-FFD is a novel framework for face forgery detection using hierarchical adaptive multi-modal learning to improve cross-domain generalization by integrating visual and textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of cross-domain generalization in face forgery detection, as conventional methods fail to learn domain-invariant representations.

Method: Proposes HAMLET-FFD, a framework leveraging bidirectional cross-modal reasoning and a knowledge refinement loop, building on contrastive vision-language models like CLIP.

Result: Demonstrates superior generalization to unseen manipulations across benchmarks, with visual analyses showing specialized embeddings for artifact recognition.

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD effectively enhances authenticity assessment by aligning visual and semantic cues, preserving CLIP's original capabilities while improving detection.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

*Kai Ye,YingShi Luan,Zhudi Chen,Guangyue Meng,Pingyang Dai,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIS-LAD, a new benchmark for Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios, addressing unique challenges like diverse viewpoints and high object density. It proposes SAARN, a Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network, to improve segmentation by dynamically routing semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RIS datasets and methods are designed for high-altitude, static views and fail in LAD scenarios due to unique challenges like viewpoint diversity and object clutter.

Method: The paper presents RIS-LAD, a dataset of 13,871 annotated image-text-mask triplets, and proposes SAARN, which uses Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) and Adaptive Reasoning Fusion Module (ARFM) to align visual and semantic features dynamically.

Result: RIS-LAD challenges state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and SAARN demonstrates effectiveness in handling LAD-specific challenges like category and object drift.

Conclusion: RIS-LAD fills a gap in RIS for LAD scenarios, and SAARN provides a robust solution for complex segmentation tasks in such environments. The dataset and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also

### [239] [Exploring text-to-image generation for historical document image retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20934)
*Melissa Cote,Alexandra Branzan Albu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2I-QBE, a method combining generative AI with ABDIR to create query images for document retrieval, tested on historical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of QBE searches requiring sample query documents by leveraging generative AI to bridge QBE and ABDIR.

Method: Uses text-to-image generation (Leonardo.Ai) to create query images from ABDIR-like attributes, then applies traditional QBE for retrieval.

Result: Experiments on HisIR19 dataset confirm T2I-QBE's viability for historical document retrieval.

Conclusion: T2I-QBE is a novel and effective approach for document image retrieval, especially for historical documents.

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARC-Hunyuan-Video is a 7B-parameter multimodal model for structured video comprehension, excelling in tasks like captioning, summarization, and reasoning, with real-world deployment success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack detailed video comprehension for effective search, recommendation, and emerging applications, especially for complex, fast-paced user-generated shorts.

Method: The model processes visual, audio, and textual signals end-to-end, trained via pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, RL post-training, and final fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in benchmarks and real-world deployment, improving user engagement with efficient inference (10s for 1-minute video).

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video effectively addresses the challenges of real-world video comprehension, offering practical benefits for diverse applications.

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

### [241] [Mask-Free Audio-driven Talking Face Generation for Enhanced Visual Quality and Identity Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20953)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Leonard B√§rmann,Hazƒ±m Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a mask-free method for audio-driven talking face generation to avoid issues like information loss and identity degradation caused by masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current masking-based methods, such as information loss, identity degradation, and unintended copying.

Method: Uses a two-step landmark-based approach to transform input images to closed mouths, then applies a lip adaptation model without masking.

Result: Achieves realistic talking face generation without masked inputs or identity references, validated on LRS2 and HDTF datasets.

Conclusion: The mask-free approach improves visual quality and identity preservation in talking face generation.

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

*Tianhao Li,Yang Li,Mengtian Li,Yisheng Deng,Weifeng Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GTAD, a global temporal aggregation denoising network, to improve 3D scene understanding by effectively leveraging both local and global temporal information from sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic environment perception in autonomous systems inadequately utilize temporal information, focusing only on local interactions between adjacent frames and missing global sequence insights.

Method: GTAD introduces a framework that aggregates local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal features from historical sequences using an in-model latent denoising network.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmarks show GTAD's superiority in providing coherent and comprehensive environment understanding.

Conclusion: GTAD effectively addresses the limitation of existing methods by integrating global temporal information, enhancing 3D scene perception for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

### [243] [Adapting Vehicle Detectors for Aerial Imagery to Unseen Domains with Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20976)
*Xiao Fang,Minhyek Jeon,Zheyang Qin,Stanislav Panev,Celso de Melo,Shuowen Hu,Shayok Chakraborty,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative AI method using latent diffusion models (LDMs) to synthesize aerial images and labels, improving vehicle detection across diverse geographic regions by addressing domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection in aerial imagery suffers from domain shifts due to geographic variability, degrading model performance.

Method: A multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge transfer framework with fine-tuned LDMs synthesizes high-quality images and labels for data augmentation.

Result: The method outperforms supervised, weakly supervised, unsupervised, and open-set detectors by significant margins (4-50%). Two new datasets are introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates domain shifts, enhancing vehicle detection performance across varied regions.

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

### [244] [LargeMvC-Net: Anchor-based Deep Unfolding Network for Large-scale Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20980)
*Shide Du,Chunming Wu,Zihan Fang,Wendi Zhao,Yilin Wu,Changwei Wang,Shiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LargeMvC-Net is a deep network for scalable multi-view clustering, improving anchor-based methods by integrating optimization principles into its architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anchor-based clustering methods lack optimization-aware designs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: LargeMvC-Net unfolds the optimization process into three modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, each derived from optimization steps.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and scalability on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net bridges the gap in anchor-based clustering by embedding optimization principles into its architecture, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JWB-DH-V1, a dataset and evaluation framework for joint whole-body motion and speech generation, highlighting gaps in current methods and performance disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of multi-modal consistency in diffusion-based video generation and the absence of comprehensive evaluation frameworks for joint audio-video quality.

Method: Introduces a large-scale dataset (10,000 identities, 2M samples) and an evaluation protocol for whole-body animatable avatars.

Result: Reveals performance disparities between face/hand-centric and whole-body generation, identifying key research areas.

Conclusion: The dataset and tools are publicly available to advance research in joint audio-video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

*Shen Li,Liuyi Yao,Wujia Niu,Lan Zhang,Yaliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Security tensors enhance LVLMs' safety by transferring textual safety alignment to visual inputs without altering model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms for text-based LLMs don't extend to visual modalities, making LVLMs vulnerable to harmful images.

Method: Introduces security tensors‚Äîtrainable input vectors applied during inference‚Äîoptimized using a curated dataset of malicious, contrastive, and benign image-text pairs.

Result: Security tensors significantly improve LVLMs' ability to reject harmful visual inputs while maintaining performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: Security tensors effectively extend text-based safety to visual modalities by activating the language module's safety layers for visual inputs.

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

### [247] [Improving Adversarial Robustness Through Adaptive Learning-Driven Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20996)
*Hayat Ullah,Syed Muhammad Talha Zaidi,Arslan Munir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation method with adaptive learning to improve CNN robustness against adversarial attacks without using adversarial data during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing adversarial training methods struggle to balance accuracy and robustness. The goal is to enhance robustness without compromising performance.

Method: The method trains multiple teacher models on perturbed data using adversarial attacks, then distills their knowledge into a student model on clean data via adaptive learning, weighting contributions based on prediction precision.

Result: The method was tested on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST, showing improved robustness against various adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The multi-teacher adversarial distillation with adaptive learning effectively enhances CNN robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

*Licai Sun,Xingxun Jiang,Haoyu Chen,Yante Li,Zheng Lian,Biu Liu,Yuan Zong,Wenming Zheng,Jukka M. Lepp√§nen,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion caption dataset, and EmoCapCLIP, a framework for learning facial emotion representations from rich natural language captions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial emotion recognition systems oversimplify emotions into predefined categories or scales, limiting generalization. Natural language offers richer, more expressive supervision, but lacks large-scale datasets and frameworks to utilize it.

Method: The authors introduce EmoCap100K, a dataset with 100,000 samples of rich emotional captions, and propose EmoCapCLIP, a joint global-local contrastive learning framework with cross-modal guided positive mining.

Result: Evaluations on 20 benchmarks across five tasks show superior performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from semantically rich captions.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of using large-scale natural language captions for facial emotion representation learning, with code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rehab-Pile, a unified dataset for rehabilitation motion assessment, proposes a benchmarking framework, and benchmarks deep learning methods to standardize research in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized benchmarks and reproducible methodologies in automated rehabilitation motion assessment.

Method: Aggregates datasets into Rehab-Pile, proposes a benchmarking framework, and evaluates deep learning architectures for classification and regression tasks.

Result: Extensive benchmarking of multiple architectures is conducted, with datasets and implementations made publicly available.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for future research, promoting reliable and accessible rehabilitation solutions.

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a large-scale open-source dataset for instruction-guided image editing, addressing the limitations of proprietary models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary models like GPT-4o hinder open-source research due to their closed nature. The paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a publicly available dataset.

Method: The dataset is constructed by unifying and refining three existing datasets using GPT-4o, enhancing visual quality and semantic clarity. Advanced open-source models are fine-tuned on this dataset for validation.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieve competitive performance, surpassing previous open-source methods and narrowing the gap to proprietary models.

Conclusion: The release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M aims to foster open research in instruction-guided image editing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

TL;DR: A survey organizes 4D spatial intelligence reconstruction into five hierarchical levels, addressing gaps in existing literature and highlighting future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive analysis of hierarchical 4D scene reconstruction and rapid advancements in the field.

Method: Categorizes existing methods into five progressive levels: low-level 3D attributes, 3D scene components, 4D dynamic scenes, interaction modeling, and physical constraints.

Result: Provides a structured framework for understanding 4D spatial intelligence reconstruction and identifies key challenges at each level.

Conclusion: Highlights promising directions for advancing 4D spatial intelligence and maintains an updated project page for tracking developments.

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel compressed sensing method for iToF systems improves depth reconstruction and multi-target separation using single modulation frequency and optimized sensing matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance depth reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation in iToF systems without hardware changes or complex modulation.

Method: Uses single modulation frequency, constructs sensing matrix with phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle waves, accounts for lens distortion, and applies K-Means clustering for sparse recovery.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and robustness, requiring no hardware modifications.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical and effective solution for improving iToF performance without additional hardware.

Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision accurately extract PCL features and assign risk categories, matching GPT-4o performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of PCL features is labor-intensive, hindering large-scale research. Automating this with LLMs can advance PCL studies.

Method: Fine-tuned LLaMA and DeepSeek using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated CoT data, evaluated on human-annotated reports with radiologist review.

Result: Improved feature extraction accuracy (up to 98%) and risk categorization (F1 ~0.95), matching GPT-4o. High radiologist-model agreement (Kappa ~0.89).

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs with CoT enable efficient, accurate PCL phenotyping, comparable to GPT-4o, supporting large-scale research.

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

### [254] [PITA: Preference-Guided Inference-Time Alignment for LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20067)
*Sarat Chandra Bobbili,Ujwal Dinesha,Dheeraj Narasimha,Srinivas Shakkottai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PITA is a novel framework that aligns LLM outputs with user preferences during inference without needing a pre-trained reward model, reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on pre-trained reward models, which can be unstable due to dependency on human preference feedback. PITA aims to bypass this limitation.

Method: PITA integrates preference feedback directly into token generation, using a small guidance policy to modify token probabilities without LLM fine-tuning. It employs stochastic search and iterative refinement.

Result: PITA is evaluated on tasks like mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, showing effectiveness in aligning outputs with user preferences.

Conclusion: PITA offers a computationally efficient and stable alternative to reward model-dependent methods for aligning LLM outputs.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

### [255] [The Policy Cliff: A Theoretical Analysis of Reward-Policy Maps in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20150)
*Xingcheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a mathematical framework to explain policy brittleness in RL for LLMs/LRMs, linking it to non-unique optimal actions and reward incompleteness. It extends this to multi-reward RL and shows entropy regularization stabilizes policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a unified theory for RL-induced failures (e.g., spurious reasoning, deceptive alignment) in LLMs/LRMs, moving beyond ad-hoc solutions.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework analyzing the reward-to-policy mapping stability, focusing on non-unique optimal actions and action degeneracy. Extend to multi-reward RL and validate with perturbation experiments.

Result: Policy brittleness arises from non-unique optimal actions; entropy regularization stabilizes policies but increases stochasticity. The framework explains empirical findings like deceptive reasoning and RLHF-induced sophistry.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled theory for policy stability, aiding the design of safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the trustworthiness of LLM-powered AI agents under adversarial attacks, revealing widespread policy violations and proposing the ART benchmark for security assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether AI agents can adhere to deployment policies in realistic, adversarial environments.

Method: Conducted a large-scale red-teaming competition with 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks on 22 AI agents across 44 scenarios.

Result: Over 60,000 attacks succeeded, revealing vulnerabilities like unauthorized data access and regulatory noncompliance. Most agents violated policies within 10-100 queries.

Conclusion: AI agents are vulnerable to adversarial misuse, and robustness does not correlate with model size or capability. The ART benchmark aims to improve security assessments.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

TL;DR: A multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system was developed for automatic chemical information extraction, achieving an F1 score of 80.8% and outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality chemical databases are crucial for AI-driven chemical research, but current methods struggle with the multimodality and variability of chemical information in literature.

Method: The system uses MLLM's reasoning to decompose tasks, coordinating specialized agents for sub-tasks like molecular image recognition and reaction parsing.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 80.8%, significantly surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (35.6%), with consistent improvements in sub-tasks.

Conclusion: This work advances automated chemical information extraction, supporting AI-driven chemical research.

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical
databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information
from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is
currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical
information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model
(MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction.
We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics
from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score:
35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent
improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction
image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.
This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction
into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical
research.

### [260] [Complementarity-driven Representation Learning for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20620)
*Lijian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoCME improves MMKGC by leveraging multimodal complementarity and dynamic negative sampling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the imbalance and overlooked complementarity in multimodal knowledge graphs for better entity representation.

Method: Proposes MoCME with CMKF for multimodal fusion and EGNS for dynamic negative sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MoCME effectively enhances entity representation and training robustness in MMKGC.

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

TL;DR: The study proposes replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec framework to enhance LLM-based recommendation systems, achieving significant performance improvements without structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in LLMs have not been fully utilized in recommendation systems, prompting the need for cost-effective improvements.

Method: Llama2 was replaced with Llama3 in the LlamaRec framework, with identical input data and random seed values for fair comparison.

Result: Performance improved by 38.65%, 8.69%, and 8.19% on ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed model replacement is a viable, cost-effective solution for enhancing recommendation system performance.

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has
intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous
release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language
understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that
these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in
LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and
architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent
developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based
recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec
framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and
identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The
experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%,
and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus
confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant
improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation
quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural
changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the
proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current
recommendation systems.

*Joseph Ko,Jerry Harrington,Kara Sulia,Vanessa Przybylo,Marcus van Lier-Walqui,Kara Lamb*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: A framework using ML models predicts 3D microphysical properties of ice crystals from 2D imagery with high accuracy, validated by synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ice crystal properties is crucial for climate studies, but direct measurement is challenging.

Method: Synthetic ice crystals are generated using 3D modeling and geometric parameters from ICEBall. ML models are trained to predict properties like density and surface area from imagery.

Result: High accuracy achieved: R¬≤ of 0.99 for density, 0.98 for surface area, and 0.91 F1 score for bullet count. Stereo views further improved predictions.

Conclusion: The ML framework effectively estimates ice crystal properties, aiding climate modeling and parameterization.

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they
significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions
of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is
challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or
morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting
three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ
two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice
crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated
from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we
use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict
effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of
bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic
images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with
high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing
single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best
single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also
quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.
A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$,
relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo
view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel
ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ
imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical
parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

TL;DR: AI integration in cryoEM/ET workflows addresses challenges like noise and orientation bias, enabling high-resolution structural biology with minimal manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in cryoEM/ET, such as low signal-to-noise ratios and preferred orientation artifacts, by leveraging deep learning.

Method: Uses AI tools like Topaz, crYOLO, spIsoNet, and ModelAngelo for tasks from particle picking to atomic model building.

Result: Achieved near-atomic resolution, resolved intractable datasets, and applied to diverse biological systems.

Conclusion: AI advancements promise further automation and deeper insights into macromolecular structures.

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.

TL;DR: FedDPG introduces a dynamic prompt generator for PLMs in federated learning, improving flexibility and efficiency while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning for PLMs is computationally heavy, and fixed prompts lack flexibility. FL addresses privacy but faces communication and computation challenges.

Method: FedDPG uses a dynamic prompt generator to create context-aware prompts, updating only these prompts while keeping PLM parameters frozen.

Result: FedDPG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in global model performance, reduces calculation time, and minimizes parameters sent in FL.

Conclusion: FedDPG offers an efficient, flexible, and privacy-preserving solution for fine-tuning PLMs in federated learning.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

TL;DR: CoMPAS3D is a large motion capture dataset for salsa dancing, designed to advance interactive humanoid AI by modeling embodied communication through dance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack the ability to engage in embodied communication like dance, which involves movement, timing, and coordination. CoMPAS3D addresses this gap.

Method: The dataset includes 3 hours of salsa dances by 18 dancers of varying skill levels, with detailed annotations for move types, errors, and style.

Result: CoMPAS3D supports tasks like leader/follower generation and duet generation, analogous to language processing tasks. A SalsaAgent model is introduced for these tasks.

Conclusion: The release of CoMPAS3D aims to foster research in interactive, expressive AI for humanoid motion and partner dance.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

TL;DR: ARPO, a novel RL algorithm for multi-turn LLM agents, balances reasoning and tool interactions using entropy-based adaptive rollouts, outperforming existing methods with half the tool-use budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL algorithms fail to balance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning and multi-turn tool interactions, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios.

Method: ARPO introduces an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism and advantage attribution estimation to dynamically balance exploration and tool-use interactions.

Result: ARPO outperforms trajectory-level RL algorithms across 13 benchmarks, achieving better performance with half the tool-use budget.

Conclusion: ARPO offers a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with dynamic environments, enhancing their reasoning and tool-use capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: $K^4$ is an unsupervised, parser-independent Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) framework using 4D descriptors for fast, accurate online anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LogAD methods are slow, parsing-dependent, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols.

Method: Transforms log embeddings into 4D descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using k-NN statistics for lightweight anomaly scoring.

Result: Achieves AUROC 0.995-0.999, outperforms baselines significantly, and is much faster (training <4s, inference ~4¬µs).

Conclusion: $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art for LogAD with superior speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on
error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce
$K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance
online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact
four-dimensional descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using
efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a
more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art
(AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being
orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low
as 4 $\mu$s.

*Xin Gao,Xingming Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EcoTransformer replaces dot-product attention with a Laplacian kernel convolution, reducing energy costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scaled dot-product attention in Transformers is computationally intensive and energy-consuming.

Method: Uses a Laplacian kernel convolution with L1 metric distances between queries and keys, eliminating matrix multiplication.

Result: Performs comparably or better than dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks with lower energy use.

Conclusion: EcoTransformer offers an efficient alternative to traditional attention mechanisms without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

### [269] [Customize Multi-modal RAI Guardrails with Precedent-based predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20503)
*Cheng-Fu Yang,Thanh Tran,Christos Christodoulopoulos,Weitong Ruan,Rahul Gupta,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance multi-modal guardrails by using 'precedents'‚Äîreasoning processes from similar prior data‚Äîinstead of fixed policies, improving flexibility and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails struggle with scalability and adaptability to varied user policies, requiring extensive retraining or facing context limitations.

Method: The approach introduces a critique-revise mechanism for collecting precedents and two strategies to use them for robust predictions.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques in few-shot and full-dataset scenarios and generalizes better to new policies.

Conclusion: Leveraging precedents enhances guardrail flexibility and adaptability, addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

TL;DR: Kimi K2 is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 32B activated and 1T total parameters, using the MuonClip optimizer for stable training. It excels in agentic tasks and benchmarks, outperforming most open/closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly capable open-source large language model, particularly for agentic tasks, by addressing training instability and leveraging advanced token efficiency.

Method: Uses MuonClip optimizer with QK-clip for stability, pre-trained on 15.5T tokens, and undergoes multi-stage post-training with agentic data synthesis and joint RL.

Result: Achieves SOTA in non-thinking benchmarks (e.g., 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench) and excels in coding, math, and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Kimi K2 is a top-tier open-source model, especially for software engineering and agentic tasks, with released checkpoints for further research.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32
billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the
MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to
address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of
Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero
loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training
process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a
joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its
capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking
models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on
Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on
SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in
non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding,
mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6,
49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without
extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable
open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering
and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to
facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.

TL;DR: The study explores how assigning personas to LLMs affects their reasoning, revealing early MLP layers process both syntax and semantics, while middle MHA layers shape outputs. Specific attention heads focus on racial and color identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how personas influence LLMs' reasoning and identify key model components encoding persona-specific information.

Method: Activation patching was used to analyze how early MLP and middle MHA layers process and transform persona tokens.

Result: Early MLP layers handle syntax and semantics, while middle MHA layers use transformed representations for output. Specific attention heads focus on racial and color identities.

Conclusion: Persona assignment impacts LLM reasoning, with early and middle layers playing distinct roles, and certain attention heads highlighting biases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

### [272] [LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999)
*Yining Huang,Bin Li,Keke Tang,Meilian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA-PAR is a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions data and parameters for System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative) tasks, using fewer parameters while matching or outperforming SOTA PEFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods focus on domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation but fail to tailor data and parameters to different response demands (System 1 vs. System 2).

Method: Classifies task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, partitions parameters by importance scoring, and uses a two-stage fine-tuning strategy (SFT for System 1, RL for System 2).

Result: Reduces active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR effectively optimizes parameter efficiency by aligning data and parameters with task demands, improving performance for both intuitive and deliberative tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

### [273] [GNSP: Gradient Null Space Projection for Preserving Cross-Modal Alignment in VLMs Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19839)
*Tiantian Peng,Yuyang Liu,Shuo Yang,Qiuhe Hong,YongHong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNSP is a continual learning method for CLIP that prevents catastrophic forgetting by projecting gradients onto the null space of prior knowledge, preserving zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting and embedding degradation in CLIP during continual fine-tuning on diverse tasks.

Method: Proposes Gradient Null Space Projection (GNSP) and combines it with knowledge distillation and a modality alignment preservation loss.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on the MTIL benchmark (11 tasks) and maintains CLIP's modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance.

Conclusion: GNSP effectively preserves CLIP's zero-shot capabilities and embedding alignment during continual learning.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

*Shishir Muralidhara,Didier Stricker,Ren√© Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLoRA applies Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to continual learning, reducing computational demands while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational constraints in continual learning, as current methods require retraining entire models, which is resource-intensive.

Method: Uses LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, leveraging a small set of parameters for all tasks.

Result: CLoRA matches or exceeds baseline performance while significantly reducing hardware requirements.

Conclusion: CLoRA is effective for resource-constrained environments, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

*Takanobu Furuhashi,Hidekata Hontani,Tatsuya Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WEEP is a novel, differentiable sparse regularizer that resolves the conflict between sparsity and gradient-based optimization, outperforming L1-norm and non-convex regularizers in denoising tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dilemma of non-differentiable sparsity-inducing penalties conflicting with gradient-based optimizers motivates the need for a differentiable alternative.

Method: WEEP is derived from the weakly-convex envelope framework, ensuring differentiability and L-smoothness while maintaining strong sparsity.

Result: WEEP outperforms L1-norm and other non-convex regularizers in signal and image denoising tasks.

Conclusion: WEEP successfully bridges the gap between statistical performance and computational tractability in sparse regularization.

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

TL;DR: SAE Debias is a lightweight, model-agnostic framework using a k-sparse autoencoder to mitigate gender bias in T2I models without retraining, offering reusable debiasing directions and interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gender bias in T2I diffusion models, which often generate stereotypical associations between professions and gendered subjects.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained k-sparse autoencoder to identify and suppress gender-relevant directions in the latent space during inference.

Result: Substantially reduces gender bias across multiple T2I models (e.g., Stable Diffusion variants) while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: SAE Debias provides an interpretable, reusable, and model-agnostic solution for fairer T2I generation, advancing socially responsible AI.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: Rep-MTL introduces a representation-level approach to multi-task learning, focusing on task saliency and inter-task complementarity to improve performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task optimization techniques focus on conflict resolution but neglect the potential of shared representation spaces for enhancing inter-task complementarity.

Method: Rep-MTL quantifies task interactions using representation-level saliency, guided by entropy-based penalization and cross-task alignment to mitigate negative transfer and promote complementary sharing.

Result: Rep-MTL achieves competitive performance on four benchmarks, balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing effectively.

Conclusion: Rep-MTL demonstrates the value of leveraging shared representation spaces for multi-task learning, offering a complementary approach to traditional optimization strategies.

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

### [278] [A Fast Parallel Median Filtering Algorithm Using Hierarchical Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19926)
*Louis Sugy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A novel median filtering algorithm using hierarchical tiling achieves faster performance than existing methods, with two variants offering $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$ complexities for $k \times k$ kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Median filtering is computationally expensive, especially for large kernels, limiting its practicality despite its effectiveness in noise removal.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical tiling approach to reduce redundant computations, with two variants: a data-oblivious selection network and a data-aware version using random-access memory.

Result: The CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than state-of-the-art methods, excelling across various data types and kernel sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm significantly improves median filtering efficiency, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital
image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is
particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular
artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median
filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels
but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time
methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such
as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the
sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.
We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate
entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access
memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$,
respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based
methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state
of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for
8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

*Margarita Leib,Nils K√∂bis,Ivan Soraperra*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines how people punish selfish behavior influenced by AI advice, comparing it to human advice and no advice. Prosocial behavior is rarely punished, while selfish behavior is penalized more harshly after prosocial advice and leniently after selfish advice. The source of advice (AI or human) does not affect punishment severity, but decision-makers are seen as more responsible when following AI advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-advice influences perceptions and punishment of selfish behavior, compared to human advice or no advice.

Method: A pre-registered, financially-incentivized experiment where evaluators punished decision-makers based on their behavior (selfish or prosocial) and the type of advice received (AI, human, or none, encouraging selfish or prosocial actions). Responsibility was also assigned to decision-makers and advisors.

Result: Selfish behavior was punished more harshly after prosocial advice and leniently after selfish advice. Prosocial behavior was rarely punished. The advice source (AI or human) did not affect punishment, but decision-makers were seen as more responsible when following AI advice.

Conclusion: Behavior and advice content significantly influence punishment, while the advice source (AI or human) does not. Decision-makers are perceived as more responsible when following AI advice, but this does not translate to harsher punishment.

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such
advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by
selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study
this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine
machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered,
financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real
decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii)
encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved
selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further
assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed
that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior
was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to
receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after
prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas
selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI
compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not
vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice
source does not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked environmental costs of LLMs, such as carbon emissions and water usage, and advocate for sustainable NLP practices.

Method: Quantifies environmental impacts through case studies of models like GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives, analyzing corporate practices and proposing solutions.

Result: LLMs contribute significantly to environmental harm, but technical, policy, and cultural changes can mitigate these effects.

Conclusion: Urgent action is needed to align AI development with planetary boundaries, ensuring ethical accountability and sustainability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural

cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in
vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model
development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening
marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for
sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum
computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and
cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry
leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the
urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate
action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article
concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary
boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems
that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

### [281] [Rainbow Noise: Stress-Testing Multimodal Harmful-Meme Detectors on LGBTQ Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19551)
*Ran Tong,Songtao Wei,Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robustness benchmark for detecting hateful memes targeting LGBTQ+ communities, testing state-of-the-art detectors (MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2) against caption and image attacks. A lightweight Text Denoising Adapter (TDA) improves MemeBLIP2's resilience, making it the most robust model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hateful memes often evade detection due to subtle tweaks in captions or images, necessitating a benchmark to evaluate and improve multimodal safety models.

Method: The study pairs four caption attacks with three image corruptions on the PrideMM dataset, testing MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2. A TDA is introduced to enhance MemeBLIP2's robustness.

Result: MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is sensitive to caption edits. The TDA remedies this, making MemeBLIP2 the most robust model. Ablations show text reliance and architectural impacts.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights weaknesses in current models and demonstrates that targeted modules like the TDA can strengthen defenses against hateful memes.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking
either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark
for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical
image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two
state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and
we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the
latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while
MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its
language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this
weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal
that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and
pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where
current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted,
lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger
defences.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FP-LGN grounds spatial language for uncertainty-aware fusion in human-robot collaboration, outperforming expert rules and improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sensing limitations in robots by fusing human observations with uncertainty awareness.

Method: FP-LGN learns map image features and spatial relation semantics via three-stage curriculum training to estimate aleatoric uncertainty.

Result: Matched expert rules in NLL, showed robustness, and improved collaborative task performance via uncertainty-aware fusion.

Conclusion: FP-LGN effectively grounds human language for better human-robot collaboration through uncertainty-aware fusion.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified digital and robotic twinning framework for validating multi-modal GNC systems in spacecraft RPO and FF, demonstrating consistency between digital and robotic twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validating GNC systems for spacecraft RPO and FF is challenging due to the complex space environment, requiring a robust V&V process.

Method: A hybrid framework integrates digital and robotic twins, using testbeds (GRAND, TRON, OS) for RF- and vision-based navigation validation.

Result: The framework shows consistent performance between digital and robotic twins, validating its reliability for GNC system assessment.

Conclusion: The hybrid twinning pipeline is effective for realistic GNC system verification, bridging simulation and real-world behavior.

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for comprehensive environmental perception in humanoid robots, overcoming challenges like kinematic interference and occlusion.

Method: Uses multi-modal fusion, grid-based occupancy outputs, and a dedicated annotation pipeline, along with a sensor layout strategy and panoramic dataset.

Result: Develops a robust perception system and the first panoramic occupancy dataset for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: Humanoid Occupancy advances environmental perception for humanoid robots and supports standardization for broader deployment in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex
real-world scenarios.

*Francisco J. Soler Mora,Adri√°n Peidr√≥ Vidal,Marc Fabregat-Ja√©n,Luis Pay√° Castell√≥,√ìscar Reinoso Garc√≠a*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for detecting navigable surfaces in truss structures to enhance climbing robot autonomy, comparing analytical algorithms and deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspection and maintenance of reticular structures are costly and hazardous, with autonomous navigation for robots being underexplored.

Method: Binary segmentation of navigable surfaces from 3D point clouds using analytical algorithms (eigendecomposition) and deep learning models (PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, PointTransformerV3).

Result: Analytical methods offer easier tuning and comparable performance, while deep learning models (e.g., PointTransformerV3 with 97% mIoU) excel in accuracy.

Conclusion: Both methods show promise for autonomous navigation, balancing computational efficiency and segmentation performance for infrastructure inspection.

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

TL;DR: LanternNet, an autonomous robotic system, effectively reduces spotted lanternfly populations and improves tree health, outperforming traditional methods in cost and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLF control methods are labor-intensive, environmentally harmful, and ineffective long-term, necessitating a scalable, autonomous solution.

Method: LanternNet uses a central hub with YOLOv8 for SLF detection and three robotic spokes for pest neutralization, monitoring, and navigation.

Result: Field tests showed significant SLF population reductions (p < 0.01) and improved tree health, with cost and scalability advantages.

Conclusion: LanternNet proves robotics and AI can transform invasive species management, offering broader ecological potential.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to
agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods,
such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive,
environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This
research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system
designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central,
tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF
identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest
neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field
deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated
LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p
< 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in
tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to
conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and
improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced
autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential
for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative
potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species
management and improved environmental outcomes.

### [287] [Taking Language Embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting into the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19830)
*Yuze Wang,Yue Qi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding using unconstrained photo collections, extending 3D Gaussian splatting with language embedding. It introduces new methods for feature extraction, optimization, and evaluation, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction focuses on visual exploration but lacks immersive understanding of architectural styles and structures. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging unconstrained photo collections for detailed 3D scene analysis.

Method: The framework extends 3D Gaussian splatting with language embedding, using multi-appearance CLIP features and uncertainty maps. It introduces a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance language field representation, and a post-ensemble strategy for feature fusion.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques, enabling accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and applications like interactive roaming, style recognition, and 3D editing.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances 3D scene understanding by integrating language and visual features, offering new possibilities for immersive architectural analysis and interaction.

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ChoreoMuse is a diffusion-based framework for generating high-quality, style-controllable dance videos that align with diverse music and dancer characteristics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to produce dance videos that harmonize with musical rhythm and user-defined styles, limiting real-world creative applications.

Method: ChoreoMuse uses SMPL parameters and a novel music encoder (MotionTune) to generate dance videos, with new metrics for evaluating style alignment.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style adherence.

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse is a robust solution for automated choreography generation, adaptable to various creative needs.

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural shell texture to disentangle geometry and appearance in Gaussian splatting, improving efficiency and detail with fewer primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality Gaussian splatting requires many primitives due to entangled geometry and appearance, which is inefficient.

Method: A neural shell texture is introduced as a global representation, using Gaussian primitives for geometry and texture sampling.

Result: The method achieves high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail, and easy mesh extraction with fewer primitives.

Conclusion: Disentangling geometry and appearance in Gaussian splatting enhances efficiency and detail while reducing primitive count.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using
significantly fewer primitives.

*Bilal Hussain Abbasi,Zirui Gong,Yanjun Zhang,Shang Gao,Antonio Robles-Kelly,Leo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConSeg, a backdoor attack method for semantic segmentation models that leverages contextual information to improve attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can misclassify victim classes as target classes when triggers are present, threatening model reliability.

Method: ConSeg mimics and rebuilds contextual information of the target class in the victim region to exploit co-occurring class relationships, enhancing attack effectiveness.

Result: ConSeg improves Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 15.55% over existing methods and resists state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: ConSeg demonstrates the effectiveness of contextual information in backdoor attacks, highlighting a significant vulnerability in semantic segmentation models.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in computer vision, semantic segmentation
models may be susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks, involving hidden
triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class
as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the
reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks
against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg
leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models
to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing
observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of
the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building
upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class
and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship
between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our
experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate
(ASR) with increases of 15.55\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting
resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how fine-tuning techniques affect LLMs in Automated Program Repair (APR), finding parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and IA3 outperform full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of fine-tuning techniques on LLMs for APR, given the high computational costs of training from scratch.

Method: Empirical evaluation of six LLMs on three APR benchmarks, comparing no fine-tuning, full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).

Result: Full fine-tuning reduces performance due to data distribution issues and overfitting, while PEFT methods yield better results.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning is more effective for adapting LLMs to APR tasks compared to full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help
developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool
chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such
models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A method to infer internal API information for project-specific code completion, improving accuracy without relying on imports, outperforming existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incorporating internal API information, which is crucial for accurate code completion, especially when APIs are not explicitly imported.

Method: Extends API representation by constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge base for LLMs. Introduces ProjBench, a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Significant improvements: 22.72% in code exact match and 18.31% in identifier exact match. Integration with baselines boosts performance further.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitation of existing approaches by leveraging inferred API information, enhancing code completion accuracy.

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.

TL;DR: The paper examines knowledge conflicts in LLMs used in finance, focusing on their investment biases and confirmation tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in research about LLMs' investment views and their misalignment with real-time market data and institutional preferences.

Method: An experimental framework using hypothetical scenarios with balanced/imbalanced arguments to analyze LLMs' latent preferences and confirmation bias.

Result: LLMs show distinct biases, favoring large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies, often hardening into confirmation bias despite counter-evidence.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit persistent investment biases, highlighting risks in deploying them for financial recommendations without addressing confirmation tendencies.

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts
due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time
market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are
deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a
model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to
unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment
views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate
such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias
in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced
and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure
their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals
distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent
preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.
These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to
initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of classifying benign vs malignant lung nodules in CT images with improved accuracy and robustness.

Method: Uses three pretrained backbones with custom classification heads, a two-stage attention mechanism, dynamic focal loss, MixUp augmentation, and test-time augmentation.

Result: Achieves 98.09 accuracy, 0.9961 AUC, and balanced sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The model serves as a robust automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening, particularly in challenging cases.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Method: The study used preoperative clinical and radiomic features from CT imaging to train a machine learning model, focusing on 3, 6, and 12-month recurrence prediction.

Result: The 3-month model achieved an AUC of 0.723, outperforming 'treat-all' or 'treat-none' strategies in decision curve analysis.

Conclusion: The model is clinically viable and highlights the importance of avoiding data leakage in prognostic modeling.

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)
remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models.
This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for
predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved
exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative
features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we
restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and
radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting
recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month
recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of
0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across
threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater
net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility
in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study
successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with
confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of
data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework
to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in
real-world settings.

*Daniel La'ah Ayuba,Jean-Yves Guillemaut,Belen Marti-Cardona,Oscar Mendez Maldonado*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpecBPP, a self-supervised learning method for hyperspectral imagery (HSI) that predicts shuffled spectral band orders, achieving state-of-the-art results in Soil Organic Carbon estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning is underexplored for HSI, despite its potential due to spectral band structure. The work aims to leverage spectral continuity for better representation learning.

Method: Proposes Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), which recovers the correct order of shuffled spectral segments. Uses curriculum-based training to handle permutation complexity.

Result: Achieves an R¬≤ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19 on SOC estimation, outperforming MAE and JEPA baselines.

Conclusion: Spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task for HSI, advancing scientific representation learning in remote sensing.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision
and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where
the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this
work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel
self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral
continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a
model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging
global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training
strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the
factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon
(SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and
joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled
samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19,
significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our
results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task
for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific
representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated breast cancer classification is challenging due to subtle differences between benign and malignant tissue.

Method: A hybrid approach fuses deep ResNet-50 features, handcrafted descriptors, and DINOv2 transformer embeddings, tested on the CBIS-DDSM dataset.

Result: The hybrid method improves AUC to 79.6%, with peak recall of 80.5% and F1 score of 67.4%, outperforming baseline and transformer-only setups.

Conclusion: The hybrid fusion approach is practical, computationally efficient, and comparable to state-of-the-art methods, suitable for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Automated breast cancer classification from mammography remains a significant
challenge due to subtle distinctions between benign and malignant tissue. In
this work, we present a hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features
from a ResNet-50 backbone with handcrafted descriptors and transformer-based
embeddings. Using the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we benchmark our ResNet-50 baseline
(AUC: 78.1%) and demonstrate that fusing handcrafted features with deep
ResNet-50 and DINOv2 features improves AUC to 79.6% (setup d1), with a peak
recall of 80.5% (setup d1) and highest F1 score of 67.4% (setup d1). Our
experiments show that handcrafted features not only complement deep
representations but also enhance performance beyond transformer-based
embeddings. This hybrid fusion approach achieves results comparable to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining architectural simplicity and
computational efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for
clinical decision support.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores how SSFL++ and KDS preprocessing reduces domain shifts in multi-source CT-scan classification, improving cross-source generalization by standardizing input space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the domain robustness of SSFL++ and KDS preprocessing in multi-source CT-scan classification.

Method: Analyzes the SSFL++ and KDS pipeline, which standardizes spatial and temporal features to align disparate inputs into a consistent target space.

Result: The pipeline reduces inter-source variance, mitigates domain shift, and improves performance across architectures, validated by winning a competitive challenge.

Conclusion: Input-space standardization via SSFL++ and KDS is a robust and practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair
cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining
Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling
(KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain
robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space
standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and
cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and
temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping
disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment
mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network
optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements
across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself.
The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a
competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and
practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel method uses Stable Diffusion-2.0 to generate synthetic skin lesion images and masks, improving deep learning model performance in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in medical image analysis for diseases like skin lesions.

Method: Adapts Stable Diffusion-2.0 via LoRA fine-tuning and multi-objective loss optimization to generate images and masks from text descriptions.

Result: Generated images closely resemble real ones (validated by FID scores), and hybrid datasets boost model performance by 8-15% in accuracy and F1-score.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable solution for medical imaging challenges, enhancing diagnosis accuracy for rare diseases.

Abstract: Medical image analysis plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of
diseases such as skin lesions. However, the scarcity of data and the class
imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We
propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model
to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding
segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification
and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of
multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate
clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual
descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated
images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A
hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the
performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial
improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive
gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach
offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data,
contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.

### [300] [Onboard Hyperspectral Super-Resolution with Deep Pushbroom Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20765)
*Davide Piccinini,Diego Valsesia,Enrico Magli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight neural network (DPSR) is proposed for real-time hyperspectral image super-resolution onboard satellites, matching pushbroom acquisition and outperforming complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have high spectral but low spatial resolution, limiting detection capabilities. Lightweight super-resolution methods are needed for onboard satellite processing.

Method: DPSR processes images line-by-line with a causal memory mechanism, reducing memory and computational demands for real-time performance.

Result: DPSR achieves competitive or superior super-resolution quality compared to complex methods, with real-time capability on low-power hardware.

Conclusion: DPSR is an efficient solution for onboard hyperspectral image super-resolution, balancing performance and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures
essential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of
limited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable
preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities
offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is
a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of
satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can
be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural
network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the
pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by
line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit
previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and
computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the
ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one,
on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved
images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are
significantly more complex.

*Zeyu Huang,Wei Meng,Quan Liu,Kun Chen,Li Ma*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive reset neuron for spiking neural networks, addressing information loss in hard reset and uniformity in soft reset, achieving high performance with low energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reset methods in spiking neural networks (hard reset causes information loss; soft reset lacks adaptability) limit performance.

Method: Designs an adaptive reset neuron linking input, output, and reset, with a threshold adjustment strategy.

Result: Achieves excellent performance on various datasets while maintaining low energy consumption.

Conclusion: The adaptive reset neuron improves performance without sacrificing energy efficiency, addressing limitations of existing reset methods.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

TL;DR: MountainLion is a multi-modal, multi-agent system using LLM-based agents to integrate financial data (text, charts, signals) for trading, improving interpretability and returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack interpretability and require large datasets. LLM-based agents offer a solution for multi-modal data integration and decision-making.

Method: MountainLion coordinates specialized LLM agents to process textual news, charts, and signals, generating reports and strategies with a reflection module for continuous improvement.

Result: The system enriches technical triggers with contextual signals, improving returns and investor confidence through interpretable, actionable frameworks.

Conclusion: MountainLion demonstrates the effectiveness of LLM-based multi-agent systems for robust, interpretable financial trading.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of
heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and
reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and
encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of
interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents
has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex
investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present
\textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading
that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and
generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news,
candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial
reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment
recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A
central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to
continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time
report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment
strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches
technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow
signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment
framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RISEE dataset, combining human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data with naturalistic driving trajectories to address gaps in existing datasets for autonomous driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack human-related information and sufficient safety-critical scenarios, while simulated datasets have low authenticity. The RISEE dataset aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: The dataset combines drone-based (high realism) and simulation-based (high safety) methods. Drone videos of highway ramp merging are reconstructed in simulation, and participants evaluate FPV videos while eye-tracking data is collected.

Result: The dataset includes 3567 subjective risk ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios and 2045 eye-tracking data segments.

Conclusion: The RISEE dataset provides a valuable resource for integrating human factors into autonomous driving R&D and V&V, addressing limitations of current datasets.

Abstract: In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V)
phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is
necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation
that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily
focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related
information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient
safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low
authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed
Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically
contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular
naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages
of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and
simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we
first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging
area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are
reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV)
videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited
participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data
is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk
ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with
2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of
the generated FPV videos are available in our website.

TL;DR: ChartGen is a pipeline for generating synthetic chart-image code pairs to evaluate chart-to-code reconstruction, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on chart summarization or Q&A, lacking evaluation of precise code reconstruction from chart images.

Method: ChartGen uses a vision-language model (VLM) to reconstruct scripts from seed images and augments them with a code-oriented LLM, creating a large synthetic dataset.

Result: Generated 222.5K chart-image code pairs, evaluated six VLMs, and identified significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: ChartGen provides a valuable dataset and pipeline to advance chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation.

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting
scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability
to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many
existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions
about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a
fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting
from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to
reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that
script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we
create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and
present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11
plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,
DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation
subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -
26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the
pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust
chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation:
