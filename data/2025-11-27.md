### [1] [Democratizing LLM Efficiency: From Hyperscale Optimizations to Universal Deployability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20662)
*Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM efficiency methods (MoE, speculative decoding, RAG) only benefit hyperscale providers and proposes a new research agenda focused on robust simplicity for democratizing LLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficiency methods collapse into overhead and fragility outside hyperscale contexts, leaving hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises without viable options while benefiting only Big Tech companies.

Method: Proposes retrofitting pretrained models with efficient architectures without retraining, lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, economical reasoning for long chains of thought, dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) benchmarking.

Result: A conceptual framework for redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness rather than just performance metrics.

Conclusion: By focusing on robust simplicity and redefining efficiency to encompass adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, LLM deployment can be democratized to reduce inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

### [2] [Harmonic Token Projection (HTP): A Vocabulary-Free, Training-Free, Deterministic, and Reversible Embedding Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20665)
*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTP is a reversible, deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, using harmonic trajectories from Unicode representations to enable semantic similarity estimation through geometric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create transparent and efficient text embeddings that don't rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, providing a deterministic alternative to data-driven neural embeddings.

Method: Encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space.

Result: Achieves Spearman correlation of 0.68 on STS-B benchmark, maintains stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair.

Conclusion: Meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

### [3] [A centroid based framework for text classification in itsm environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20667)
*Hossein Mohanna,Ali Ait-Bachir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework for hierarchical text classification in ITSM systems, achieving competitive performance with SVM while providing interpretability and significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is essential in ITSM systems for categorizing support tickets into tree-structured taxonomies, requiring both accuracy and operational efficiency.

Method: Dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time.

Result: Achieves hierarchical F1 score of 0.731 (vs 0.727 for SVM), 5.9x faster training, up to 152x faster incremental updates, and 8.6-8.8x speedup across batch sizes when excluding embedding computation.

Conclusion: The method is suitable for production ITSM environments that prioritize interpretability through centroid representations and operational efficiency through significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

### [4] [PIRA: Preference-Oriented Instruction-Tuned Reward Models with Dual Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20668)
*Yongfu Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PIRA is a training paradigm that improves reward models for LLM alignment through instruction reformulation, reward aggregation, and dropout-based stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models have low data efficiency due to direct concatenation of questions and responses, and are vulnerable to reward overoptimization.

Method: Three strategies: (1) Reformulate question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions, (2) aggregate rewards from diverse preference tasks, (3) average value-head outputs under varying dropout rates.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PIRA in improving reward model performance.

Conclusion: PIRA successfully addresses key challenges in reward modeling for LLM alignment through its three-component approach.

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

### [5] [Structured Definitions and Segmentations for Legal Reasoning in LLMs: A Study on Indian Legal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20669)
*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with legal tasks due to lack of domain-specific training. This paper shows that structuring legal documents by rhetorical roles and explaining legal terminology improves model performance by 1.5-4.36% in F1 score on Indian legal judgment prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack domain-specific pretraining for legal tasks, and legal documents are long and complex, making it difficult for models to process them effectively. Previous in-context approaches have shown promise but need improvement.

Method: Three experimental approaches: (i) reorganizing documents by rhetorical roles to improve long context processing, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize models with legal terminology, (iii) emulating court step-by-step reasoning about rhetorical roles. All experiments conducted in zero-shot setting on three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets.

Result: Organizing data by rhetorical roles and explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with improvements ranging from ~1.5% to 4.36% in F1 score compared to baseline.

Conclusion: Structuring legal information through rhetorical roles and domain-specific terminology explanations effectively enhances LLM performance on legal tasks without requiring full domain retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

### [6] [MindSET: Advancing Mental Health Benchmarking through Large-Scale Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20672)
*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly,Daniel Wiechmann,Elma Kerz,Edward Kempa,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindSET is a new benchmark dataset for mental health analysis from Reddit with 13M annotated posts across 7 conditions, offering improved data quality and outperforming previous benchmarks by up to 18 F1 points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mental health benchmarks are outdated due to limited data, inadequate cleaning, and inability to handle diverse social media content like multilingual and harmful material.

Method: Curated Reddit data using self-reported diagnoses, applied rigorous preprocessing (language filtering, NSFW removal, duplicate removal), performed linguistic analysis with LIWC, and conducted binary classification experiments with fine-tuned language models and BoW features.

Result: MindSET contains over 13M annotated posts (more than twice previous benchmarks). Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed previous benchmarks, achieving up to 18-point F1 improvement for Autism detection.

Conclusion: MindSET provides a robust foundation for mental health research using social media data, supporting early risk detection and analysis of emerging psychological trends.

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

### [7] [Semantics Meet Signals: Dual Codebook Representationl Learning for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20673)
*Zheng Hui,Xiaokai Wei,Reza Shirkavand,Chen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Alejandro Peláez,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlexCode introduces a popularity-aware framework that uses separate collaborative filtering and semantic codebooks with adaptive token allocation to address the imbalance between popular and long-tail items in generative recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative recommendation approaches use a single uniform codebook for all items, which overlooks the inherent imbalance between popular items (rich in collaborative signals) and long-tail items (dependent on semantic understanding), limiting representational efficiency and generalization.

Method: FlexCode adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering codebook and a semantic codebook using a lightweight Mixture of Experts (MoE) to balance CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, with alignment and smoothness objectives to maintain coherence.

Result: Experiments on public and industrial-scale datasets show that FlexCode consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving stronger accuracy and better tail robustness.

Conclusion: FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders that effectively balances memorization and generalization, offering improved performance for both popular and long-tail items.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

### [8] [Prompt Engineering Techniques for Context-dependent Text-to-SQL in Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20677)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,May Alsofyani,Saad Almohaimeed,Mansour Al Ghanim,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset, and presents experiments with LLMs and a novel GAT corrector approach that improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of Arabic language resources for cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL tasks, as most existing work focuses on English and Chinese.

Method: Created Ar-SParC dataset with 3,450 question sequences (10,225 total questions) and conducted 40 experiments using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo with various prompt engineering techniques, plus developed a novel GAT corrector approach.

Result: The GAT corrector enhanced performance across all experiments, with average improvements of 1.9% in execution accuracy and 1.9% in interaction accuracy under zero-shot settings, and 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the Arabic text-to-SQL gap with a comprehensive dataset and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed GAT corrector approach, outperforming previous techniques.

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4 makes reasoning errors in 23% of oncology interpretations, leading to potentially harmful clinical recommendations, especially in advanced cancer cases. A hierarchical taxonomy was developed to classify these reasoning failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and classify reasoning errors in large language models used for oncology decision support, as these errors can lead to clinically unsafe recommendations despite high benchmark performance.

Method: Developed a three-tier hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes, validated on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes across disease stages.

Result: Reasoning errors occurred in 23% of interpretations, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias being most common. These errors were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management.

Conclusion: Large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a framework for evaluating reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

### [10] [Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683)
*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic Template Selection (DTS) adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving 32.6-33.9% token reduction across major LLM providers while maintaining 90.5% routing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types lead to token inefficiency, which is costly due to output tokens being 4-8x more expensive than input tokens across major providers.

Method: Two routing approaches: simple MLP using pre-computed embeddings and fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer, evaluated on 1,000 MMLU questions with 9,000 production API calls across 3 major LLM providers.

Result: MLP router achieved 90.5% routing accuracy (slightly better than RoBERTa's 89.5%) with 125M fewer parameters, and routing decisions generalized effectively across providers with consistent 90.5% accuracy and 32.6-33.9% token reductions.

Conclusion: DTS provides significant cost reductions without compromising response quality, with provider-agnostic template selection behavior and better performance from simpler MLP approach.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in accessing comprehensive synthesis information for 2D materials due to dispersed data across research papers.

Method: The method appears to involve analyzing published research papers to extract and organize synthesis information for 2D materials.

Result: The abstract is incomplete, so specific results cannot be determined from the provided content.

Conclusion: Based on the partial abstract, the paper likely concludes that systematic organization of 2D material synthesis information is needed for better accessibility and application in energy storage and conversion.

### [12] [Memories Retrieved from Many Paths: A Multi-Prefix Framework for Robust Detection of Training Data Leakage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20799)
*Trung Cuong Dang,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces multi-prefix memorization framework to better detect verbatim data memorization in LLMs by measuring retrieval path diversity rather than single-path extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memorization definitions have shortcomings in comprehensively capturing data memorization, especially in aligned models, creating privacy and copyright risks.

Method: Defines memorization based on whether external adversarial search can find a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit the same sequence, measuring robustness through retrieval path diversity.

Result: The multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data in experiments on open-source and aligned chat models.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs by shifting focus to quantifying memory robustness through diverse retrieval paths.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

*Jiaojiao Han,Wujiang Xu,Mingyu Jin,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE is an agent-based framework that improves feature interpretation in sparse autoencoders by using an active, iterative process of explanation formulation, testing, and refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are opaque, making safe deployment challenging. While sparse autoencoders help decompose representations into interpretable features, explaining these features remains difficult.

Method: SAGE transforms feature interpretation into an active process: systematically generates multiple explanations, designs targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refines explanations based on activation feedback.

Result: Experiments on SAEs from diverse language models show SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SAGE provides a more effective framework for interpreting features in sparse autoencoders through its active, explanation-driven approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSPy+HELM framework improves LM benchmarking by using structured prompting methods that elicit reasoning, revealing that traditional HELM underestimates performance and misrepresents leaderboard rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarking frameworks like HELM use fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, leading to unrepresentative performance estimates and inaccurate deployment decisions.

Method: Developed a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework with four structured prompting methods to elicit reasoning, evaluated across four frontier LMs and seven benchmarks against HELM baselines.

Result: HELM underestimates LM performance by 4% average, increases performance variance (+2% std dev), misrepresents leaderboard rankings (flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and reasoning reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design.

Conclusion: Scalable performance ceiling estimation through structured prompting enables more accurate and decision-useful LM benchmarking, with open-source tools provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

*Dong Dong,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Length-MAX tokenizer reduces token count by 13-18% compared to BPE, leading to faster training (17-19% fewer steps), lower inference latency (13-14% reduction), and improved downstream task performance while maintaining high vocabulary coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient tokenizer that minimizes the average tokens per character, reducing computational costs during training and inference while maintaining or improving model performance.

Method: Casts length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and develops a greedy approximation algorithm to obtain vocabulary that minimizes token count per character.

Result: Achieves 14-18% fewer tokens than BPE across various vocabulary sizes, 18.5% fewer training steps to reach validation loss, 13.7% lower inference latency, 16% throughput gain, and improved downstream performance (11.7% lower LAMBADA perplexity, 4.3% higher HellaSwag accuracy).

Conclusion: Optimizing for average token length rather than frequency alone provides an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing downstream performance, with practical benefits including 18% memory reduction for embeddings and KV-cache.

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

*Tianxin Wei,Noveen Sachdeva,Benjamin Coleman,Zhankui He,Yuanchen Bei,Xuying Ning,Mengting Ai,Yunzhe Li,Jingrui He,Ed H. Chi,Chi Wang,Shuo Chen,Fernando Pereira,Wang-Cheng Kang,Derek Zhiyuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evo-Memory is a benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents across sequential task streams, addressing limitations of static memory evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM memory evaluations focus on static conversational settings, overlooking dynamic memory accumulation and reuse across evolving task streams in real-world environments.

Method: Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, implements over 10 memory modules, and proposes ReMem pipeline that integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates.

Result: The framework enables evaluation of memory evolution across 10 diverse datasets, providing baseline methods like ExpRAG for experience retrieval and ReMem for continual improvement.

Conclusion: Evo-Memory bridges the gap in evaluating self-evolving memory capabilities in LLM agents, enabling better assessment of continuous learning and experience reuse in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

### [17] [Winning with Less for Low Resource Languages: Advantage of Cross-Lingual English_Persian Argument Mining Model over LLM Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20872)
*Ali Jahan,Masood Ghayoomi,Annette Hautli-Janisz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-lingual argument mining approach for low-resource languages using three training scenarios: zero-shot transfer, LLM-augmented English training, and cross-lingual model combining English and Persian data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in argument mining for low-resource languages by leveraging cross-lingual approaches and exploring different training strategies.

Method: Three training scenarios: (1) zero-shot transfer from English to Persian, (2) English training enhanced with LLM-generated synthetic examples, (3) cross-lingual model combining original English data with manually translated Persian sentences.

Result: Zero-shot: 50.2% F1 (English), 50.7% F1 (Persian); LLM-augmented: 59.2% F1 (English), 69.3% F1 (Persian); Cross-lingual: 74.8% F1 (Persian). Cross-lingual model outperforms others.

Conclusion: Lightweight cross-lingual blending outperforms resource-intensive augmentation pipelines and provides practical solution for argument mining in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

TL;DR: LLMs form compact, causally isolated circuits for semantic roles through gradual refinement, showing partial transfer across model scales and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models internally ground abstract semantic structure, as their internal mechanisms remain insufficiently characterized despite semantic competence.

Method: Integrated approach using role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study semantic role implementation in LLMs.

Result: Found highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes), gradual structural refinement without phase transitions, and moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) with high spectral similarity.

Conclusion: LLMs develop compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure that exhibit partial transfer across different model scales and architectures.

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

*Reham Omar,Abdelghny Orogat,Ibrahim Abdelaziz,Omij Mangukiya,Panos Kalnis,Essam Mansour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chatty-KG is a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over knowledge graphs that combines RAG-style retrieval with structured SPARQL query execution, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing KGQA systems that struggle with multi-turn context, coreference resolution, and dialogue coherence while maintaining low latency and supporting dynamic knowledge graphs without requiring fine-tuning.

Method: Uses task-specialized LLM agents that collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity/relation linking, and query planning to generate executable SPARQL queries from natural language questions.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores across large and diverse KGs, with broad compatibility across commercial and open-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: Chatty-KG successfully unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA that preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

*Ioana Buhnila,Aman Sinha,Mathieu Constant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform best on definition-type queries but struggle with exemplification and other answer types, with performance varying based on concept frequency and technicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why LLMs excel at definition-type answers but perform poorly on other answer types like examples and paraphrases, and to understand the impact of pre-training data on this performance gap.

Method: Used TrackList analysis pipeline and RefoMed-EN dataset (6170 medical terms with human annotations) to evaluate LLM performance on different query types, analyzing syntactic/semantic similarity, statistical correlations, and embeddings.

Result: LLMs showed highest performance on definition-type questions and lowest on exemplification-type questions. For definitions, models paraphrase more on popular/frequent knowledge and less on tail/technical knowledge, especially in expert texts.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant performance gaps across different answer types, with concept frequency and technicality affecting their ability to provide diverse linguistic responses beyond simple definitions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

### [21] [Semantic Anchors in In-Context Learning: Why Small LLMs Cannot Flip Their Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21038)
*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL cannot override pre-trained label semantics in LLMs; it mainly refines existing semantic directions rather than remapping label meanings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether in-context learning can fundamentally change pre-trained label semantics or merely refine existing semantic knowledge in LLMs.

Method: Treat LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and test with natural demonstrations (correct labels) vs inverted demonstrations (flipped labels), using three alignment metrics and semantic override rate.

Result: Models maintain strong prior alignment with natural demonstrations and cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers with inverted demonstrations - semantic override rates remain zero.

Conclusion: ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, showing fundamental limits of few-shot prompting for overriding label semantics.

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

### [22] [Context-Aware Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting for Sarcasm Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21066)
*Michael Iskandardinata,William Christian,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a retrieval-aware approach that combines web-based retrieval and self-knowledge awareness to enhance sarcasm detection in LLMs, showing significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection remains challenging for PLMs and LLMs due to linguistic diversity, cultural variations, and unreliable detection of words requiring extra grounding. Current models struggle with context-dependent sarcasm.

Method: Built on Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), the approach adds two context strategies: non-parametric knowledge via web retrieval for missing background, and self-knowledge awareness to elicit the model's internal knowledge.

Result: Non-parametric retrieval improved macro-F1 by 9.87% on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic. Self-knowledge retrieval improved macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and 4.08% on MUStARD compared to original PMP.

Conclusion: Context is crucial for enhancing LLM performance in sarcasm detection, especially for culturally specific slang and unknown terms. Future work will optimize retrieval quality and relevance assessment.

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks typically fine-tune only the final layer with frozen encoder weights. MLPs are commonly used but have limitations in expressiveness and computational efficiency.

Method: Evaluated three KAN variants (FourierKAN, EfficientKAN, FasterKAN) as classification heads across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT), comparing them against traditional MLPs.

Result: KAN-based heads were competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered best speed-accuracy trade-off. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1).

Conclusion: KANs serve as expressive and efficient alternatives to MLPs for classification tasks in low-resource languages, demonstrating competitive or superior performance across various embedding types.

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

*Bryan E. Tuck,Rakesh M. Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-architecture evaluation of 28 LLM configurations on word puzzles reveals architectural differences matter more than parameter scaling for character-level constraint satisfaction, with systematic failures on orthographically unusual but valid words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how different LLM architectures and scaling approaches perform on hard orthographic constraints in controlled text generation, which remains limited in current research.

Method: Evaluated 28 configurations across three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction, using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle.

Result: Architectural differences produced 2.0-2.2x performance gaps (F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) versus 83% gain from parameter scaling; thinking budget sensitivity was heterogeneous; models showed systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (86-95% human success vs 89-96% model miss rate).

Conclusion: Constraint satisfaction requires specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard scaling, as models over-rely on distributional plausibility and penalize orthographically atypical but valid patterns.

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

Result: AEC model reduced average WER from 51.56 to 39.82 (pre-augmentation) and 51.56 to 43.59 (post-augmentation), improved chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627.

Conclusion: AEC is robust and feature design is crucial for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

*Manish Jain,Satheesh Kumar Ponnambalam,Salman Faroz,Chandrakanth Lns,Vinay Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MortgageLLM is a domain-specific LLM for mortgage finance that uses a dual-track specialization framework to create two expert models - one for conversational Q&A and another for structured tasks - avoiding performance trade-offs of single multi-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for specialized sectors like mortgage finance, and single multi-task models suffer from performance trade-offs where optimizing for structured tasks degrades conversational fidelity.

Method: Dual-track specialization from LLaMA-3.1-8B base model, creating two specialists: conversational Q&A model and structured task model for classification/summarization, with instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities and intelligent task routing mechanism.

Result: Significantly outperforms base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct: summarization score 4.58 vs 3.99, Q&A score 4.09 vs 4.0, classification score 2.6 vs 1.2, and improved BERTScore across all tasks.

Conclusion: The dual-expert approach effectively addresses domain specialization challenges in mortgage finance while maintaining instruction-following capabilities, demonstrating superior performance over baseline approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

TL;DR: SGASA framework enhances reasoning models' safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts through adaptive safety alignment using synthesized guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models are vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak prompts that bypass safety mechanisms, creating need for adaptive defense that autonomously reinforces safety.

Method: Two-stage framework: Data Pre-synthesis generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; Alignment Fine-tuning uses SFT and DPO to embed guidelines into model.

Result: Extensive experiments show SGASA significantly improves model safety across multiple datasets while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests.

Conclusion: SGASA provides effective, adaptive and scalable safety alignment that strengthens models' robustness against harmful adversarial prompts.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

*Steven Wang,Kyle Hunt,Shaojie Tang,Kenneth Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on small human survey data improves response diversity and alignment with human behavior, but still fails to reproduce regression coefficients needed for inferential analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if fine-tuning LLMs on small human datasets can address limitations of using LLMs as human substitutes in research, particularly issues with diversity, subgroup alignment, and belief-action coherence.

Method: Used a behavioral experiment on information disclosure to compare human and LLM responses, fine-tuning LLMs on small human survey samples and evaluating across multiple dimensions including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and regression coefficient recovery.

Result: Fine-tuning improved heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence compared to base models, but even the best fine-tuned models failed to reproduce the original study's regression coefficients.

Conclusion: While fine-tuning helps address some LLM limitations, LLM-generated data remains unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses due to inability to reproduce key statistical relationships.

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

### [29] [Developing an Open Conversational Speech Corpus for the Isan Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21229)
*Adisai Na-Thalang,Chanakan Wittayasakpan,Kritsadha Phatcharoen,Supakit Buakaw*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Development of the first open conversational speech dataset for Isan language, featuring natural speech with authentic linguistic phenomena and addressing challenges of non-standardized orthography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create the first conversational speech dataset for Isan language, addressing the lack of resources for this widely spoken Thai regional dialect and supporting inclusive AI development for underrepresented languages.

Method: Established practical transcription protocols that balance representational accuracy with computational processing requirements, handling challenges of non-standardized orthography and variable writing practices.

Result: Created an open conversational speech dataset capturing authentic Isan linguistic phenomena including colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and code-switching with central Thai.

Conclusion: The dataset contributes to inclusive AI development, supports research on underrepresented languages, and provides a foundation for addressing linguistic and technical challenges in modeling conversational speech.

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

*Robert Belanec,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Maria Bielikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEFT-Bench is a unified benchmark for evaluating parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods on large language models across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods, with a new metric (PSCP) that considers trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have high computational and environmental costs that limit accessibility, and current PEFT method evaluations are limited and difficult to reproduce.

Method: Developed PEFT-Bench as a unified end-to-end benchmark, evaluated across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods, and introduced PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric.

Result: Created a comprehensive benchmark that accounts for different PEFT training and inference factors including trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage.

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench bridges the gap in current PEFT evaluations by providing a unified, reproducible benchmark with comprehensive metrics for comparing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

### [31] [Emergent Lexical Semantics in Neural Language Models: Testing Martin's Law on LLM-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21334)
*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic investigation of Martin's Law (word frequency-polysemy relationship) in neural language models during training, revealing a non-monotonic developmental trajectory with an optimal semantic window.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linguistic regularities like Martin's Law emerge in neural language models during training and whether compliance with such linguistic patterns increases monotonically with training.

Method: Used DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings to operationalize word senses, analyzed four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints.

Result: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, peaks at checkpoint 104 (r > 0.6), then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models experience catastrophic semantic collapse, while larger models show graceful degradation. Frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r ≈ -0.3).

Conclusion: Compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window rather than increasing monotonically with training.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

*Joshua Fonseca Rivera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning enables reliable detection of injected activation patterns in language models, transforming near-failure (0.4% accuracy) to 85% accuracy with 0% false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if introspective awareness in language models can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence, addressing Lindsey's open question about training for introspection.

Method: Fine-tuning a 7B parameter model on transient single-token injections of activation patterns, testing detection and semantic content reporting across subsequent generation steps.

Result: Model achieved 85% accuracy on held-out concepts with 0% false positives, demonstrating reliable detection of fleeting "thoughts" and generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap).

Conclusion: At least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced through training, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency and addressing cross-model differences.

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

*Antonín Jarolím,Martin Fajčík,Lucia Makaiová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper creates a new dataset for fine-grained evidence extraction in Czech and Slovak claims, evaluates LLMs on this task, and finds that models often fail to copy evidence verbatim, with varying performance across different model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spreads in online news comments, requiring methods to detect incorrect information by identifying relevant documents and exact text spans that support or refute claims.

Method: Created a new dataset with two-way annotated fine-grained evidence by paid annotators and evaluated various large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations.

Result: LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from source text, leading to invalid outputs. Llama3.1:8b achieves high correct outputs despite small size, while gpt-oss-120b underperforms. Qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b show effective balance between size and alignment.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in fine-grained evidence extraction with LLMs, showing that model size doesn't always correlate with performance, and identifies specific models that achieve good balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

*Zhifeng Hao,Qibin Song,Ruichu Cai,Boyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL is a dual-state reasoning framework that improves Text-to-SQL performance by modeling SQL generation as interaction between adaptive context state and progressive generation state, achieving competitive results without post-training or examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought approaches struggle with complex enterprise databases due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics.

Method: Dual-state reasoning framework with adaptive context state that refines large schemas and selects relevant structures, and progressive generation state that formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions for self-correction.

Result: Achieved 35.28% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32% on BIRD development set without any post-training or in-context examples.

Conclusion: DSR-SQL effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches for complex enterprise databases through its dual-state reasoning framework, demonstrating competitive performance on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

*Kaifeng Hong,Yinglong Zhang,Xiaoying Hong,Xuewen Xia,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Odin is a new architecture that integrates graph structure into Transformers at specific layers through oriented dual-module mechanism, avoiding multi-hop diffusion and over-smoothing while achieving state-of-the-art performance on text-rich graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for text-attributed graphs either rely on GNNs (limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion) or Transformers (that ignore graph topology). There's a need for better integration of textual understanding and structural reasoning.

Method: Odin injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths using oriented dual-module mechanism. Multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers aligned with semantic hierarchy. Light Odin is a lightweight variant for efficiency.

Result: Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks. Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration that strictly contains expressive power of both pure Transformers and GNNs.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model merging doesn't work well for LLMs - only simple Task Arithmetic shows reliable gains, while other methods cause performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether model merging techniques that work for smaller models generalize to large language models (LLMs).

Method: Large-scale evaluation of 6 state-of-the-art merging methods across 4 LLMs, 12 fine-tuned checkpoints per model, and 16 benchmarks, measuring performance against base models and best individual checkpoints.

Result: Only Task Arithmetic (oldest/simplest method) reliably improves LLM performance. Other interference-aware and subspace methods typically cause significant performance degradation.

Conclusion: Current merging techniques don't transfer well to modern LLMs, motivating the need for LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: Proposes a bidirectional readability assessment model that uses sentence-level analysis and pairwise sorting to handle text length and ordinal label relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning approaches for readability assessment fail to consider text length and ordinal relationships between readability labels.

Method: Uses bidirectional mechanism to capture contextual information, predicts sentence-level readability, then aggregates for document-level assessment. Introduces pairwise sorting algorithm to model ordinal relationships through label subtraction.

Result: Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets show competitive performance, outperforming other baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses text length and ordinal label relationship issues in readability assessment, achieving strong performance across languages.

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

*Lina Conti,Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Guillaume Wisniewski,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech translation models use acoustic cues and language patterns to assign gender to speaker-referring terms, with models learning broader masculine biases rather than just replicating training data patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how speech translation models assign gender when translating from languages with notional gender (like English) to languages with grammatical gender, addressing concerns about misgendering speakers based on vocal characteristics.

Method: Investigated three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining training data patterns, internal language model biases, and acoustic information interactions using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms.

Result: Models learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence rather than term-specific gender associations. While ILM shows strong masculine bias, models can override these with acoustic input. Higher-accuracy models use first-person pronouns to link gendered terms to speakers, accessing gender information distributed across frequency spectrum.

Conclusion: Speech translation models employ complex mechanisms for gender assignment that combine acoustic cues, language patterns, and pronoun-based linking strategies, with gender information distributed beyond just pitch cues in the frequency spectrum.

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

Motivation: Bangla Sign Language Translation has been severely constrained due to being a low-resource language, and there's a need for standard sentence-level datasets to develop AI-based assistive tools for the deaf and hard of hearing Bangla-speaking community.

Method: Created the IsharaKhobor dataset with two subsets (IsharaKhobor_small and IsharaKhobor_canonical_small) through vocabulary restriction and canonicalization. Benchmarked using landmark-based raw and RQE embeddings.

Result: Developed a publicly available dataset at kaggle.com/datasets/hasanssl/isharakhobor that enables research in BdSLT, with documented challenges and proposed ways forward.

Conclusion: The IsharaKhobor dataset fills a critical gap in Bangla Sign Language resources and provides a foundation for developing AI assistive technologies for the deaf community, with additional subsets offering focused research opportunities.

Abstract: Bangla Sign Language Translation (BdSLT) has been severely constrained so far as the language itself is very low resource. Standard sentence level dataset creation for BdSLT is of immense importance for developing AI based assistive tools for deaf and hard of hearing people of Bangla speaking community. In this paper, we present a dataset, IsharaKhobor , and two subset of it for enabling research. We also present the challenges towards developing the dataset and present some way forward by benchmarking with landmark based raw and RQE embedding. We do some ablation on vocabulary restriction and canonicalization of the same within the dataset, which resulted in two more datasets, IsharaKhobor_small and IsharaKhobor_canonical_small.

TL;DR: RoParQ benchmark evaluates LLM consistency on paraphrased questions, with XParaCon metric measuring robustness. A paraphrase-aware SFT method improves model consistency, making smaller models perform like larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show inconsistent behavior on paraphrased questions, indicating reliance on surface patterns rather than semantic understanding.

Method: Created RoParQ benchmark from standard datasets using model-generated paraphrases, proposed XParaCon metric, and implemented reasoning-based paraphrase-aware SFT.

Result: Fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to larger pre-trained models, showing significant robustness improvement.

Conclusion: Targeted alignment through paraphrase-aware SFT effectively mitigates superficial memorization and fosters more robust, reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: A lightweight method for isolating neurons that encode specific skills in LLMs, extending skill neuron analysis to complex multi-skill scenarios using activation correlations with auxiliary metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show remarkable capabilities but their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, creating a need for interpretability methods that can uncover how specific skills are encoded.

Method: Extends skill neuron identification via soft prompt training to complex scenarios, correlating neuron activations with auxiliary metrics like external labels and model confidence scores without manual token aggregation.

Result: Successfully validated on open-ended text generation and natural language inference tasks, detecting neurons that drive known skills and reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

Conclusion: The method provides an interpretable, task-specific approach to understanding LLM internal mechanisms and can uncover hidden behavioral patterns like reasoning shortcuts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Metadata beyond URLs can accelerate LLM pretraining, with fine-grained quality indicators being particularly effective. Metadata appending and learnable meta-tokens further improve training efficiency by inducing quality-aware latent structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work only explored URLs as useful metadata for LLM pretraining acceleration, leaving other metadata types unexplored despite their potential for greater benefits.

Method: Investigated various metadata types, introduced metadata appending as auxiliary task, used learnable meta-tokens with masked loss, and analyzed latent representations through probing.

Result: Found that fine-grained document quality indicators and other metadata types can accelerate pretraining when prepended. Metadata appending and learnable meta-tokens also improve training efficiency by creating quality-aware latent structures.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidelines for integrating diverse metadata types to enhance both efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining, with fine-grained information encoding being a key feature of effective metadata.

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

*Anna Marklová,Ondřej Vinš,Martina Vokáčová,Jiří Milička*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Czech native speakers cannot reliably distinguish AI-generated poetry from human-written poetry, showing AI can convincingly produce poetry even in morphologically complex, low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry, testing if native speakers can identify authorship and how they aesthetically judge it, given most AI poetry research focuses on English.

Method: Conducted study with Czech native speakers who guessed authorship and rated aesthetic quality of poems, using logistic regression to analyze factors affecting recognition accuracy.

Result: Participants performed at chance level (45.8% correct) identifying authorship. AI poems were rated equally or better than human ones, but authorship bias caused lower ratings when participants believed poems were AI-generated.

Conclusion: AI can produce convincing poetry in complex, low-resource languages like Czech, and readers' authorship beliefs are interconnected with their aesthetic evaluations of poems.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Matrix is a decentralized framework for multi-agent synthetic data generation that eliminates central orchestrators, using distributed queues for control and data flow, achieving 2-15x higher throughput without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent synthesis frameworks suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to centralized orchestrators or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility and efficiency in synthetic data generation.

Method: Matrix uses a decentralized peer-to-peer design where control and data flow are represented as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. It leverages Ray for scalability and handles compute-intensive operations via distributed services while lightweight agents progress tasks independently.

Result: Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and achieves 2-15x higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources across diverse scenarios including multi-agent dialogue, web reasoning extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation.

Conclusion: Matrix provides a scalable, flexible framework for multi-agent synthetic data generation that significantly outperforms existing approaches in throughput while maintaining output quality across various application domains.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

TL;DR: ToolOrchestra trains small orchestrators to coordinate intelligent tools, achieving higher accuracy at lower cost than previous methods while aligning with user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with deep complex problems like Humanity's Last Exam, being both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. There's a need for more efficient and effective approaches to solve difficult agentic tasks.

Method: ToolOrchestra uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards to train small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools.

Result: Orchestrator (8B model) achieves 37.1% on HLE, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, it surpasses GPT-5 by wide margins using only ~30% of the cost.

Conclusion: Composing diverse tools with lightweight orchestration models is more efficient and effective than existing methods, enabling practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

### [46] [Revisiting Generalization Across Difficulty Levels: It's Not So Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21692)
*Yeganeh Kordi,Nihal V. Nayak,Max Zuo,Ilana Nguyen,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show limited cross-difficulty generalization - training on easy or hard data alone doesn't consistently improve performance across all difficulty levels, highlighting the need for diverse difficulty ranges in training and evaluation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicting research about whether training on easier or harder data leads to better LLM performance and whether gains transfer across difficulty levels, using objective difficulty metrics.

Method: Systematic evaluation using Item Response Theory (IRT) to rank example difficulty based on outputs from thousands of different LLMs, excluding human opinions, across six datasets with fine-grained difficulty groups.

Result: Cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties.

Conclusion: Having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data is crucial for LLMs, and taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty selection is risky.

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

### [47] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neuroscience-inspired topological regularization framework to enhance privacy resilience in multi-modal vision-language models against membership inference attacks, showing 24% reduction in attack success while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal models introduce new privacy attack vectors, and while neuro-inspired approaches have shown resilience in unimodal systems against adversarial attacks, their effectiveness against privacy attacks in multi-modal models remains unexplored.

Method: Proposed a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze multi-modal VLMs resilience. Tested on three VLMs (BLIP, PaliGemma 2, ViT-GPT2) across three datasets (COCO, CC3M, NoCaps) comparing baseline vs neuro VLMs with tau > 0.

Result: NEURO VLMs showed 24% mean ROC-AUC drop in MIA attack success on BLIP model with COCO dataset, while maintaining similar model utility (MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics). Results were consistent across PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models on additional datasets.

Conclusion: Neuro-inspired VLMs with topological regularization are more resilient against privacy attacks without significantly compromising model utility, contributing to understanding privacy risks in multi-modal models.

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix is a next-generation inference engine optimized for semi-autoregressive decoding to enable immersive world synthesis through coherent and stable video generation, distinguishing itself from high-concurrency systems and classic video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are crucial for agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming as they can generate long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, moving beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models.

Method: Inferix uses semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm that merges diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in blocks - applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones. It reintroduces LLM-style KV Cache management for efficient, variable-length generation and includes interactive video streaming, profiling, and LV-Bench integration for benchmarking.

Result: The semi-autoregressive approach enables more coherent and stable video sequences compared to standard video diffusion, overcoming limitations by providing efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation capabilities.

Conclusion: Inferix is specifically designed as a dedicated world simulation engine with optimized semi-autoregressive decoding, interactive streaming, and benchmarking support to advance world model exploration and foster community development in this emerging field.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTED-Ada is a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection for video object recognition, optimized for both single-device and multi-device scenarios using federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained devices like traffic cameras struggle with fast and accurate video object recognition. While mobile edge computing enables offloading computation-intensive detection to edge servers, the challenge is deciding when to use local tracking vs edge detection.

Method: Formulated long-term optimization problems for single/multi-device scenarios, proposed LTED-Ada using deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select between local tracking and edge detection based on frame rate, accuracy, and delay requirements. Enhanced with federated learning for multi-device collaborative policy training.

Result: Extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using Raspberry Pi 4B devices and PC edge server demonstrated the superiority of LTED-Ada in performance.

Conclusion: LTED-Ada effectively addresses the adaptive selection challenge between local tracking and edge detection for video object recognition, showing superior performance through comprehensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD is a training-free early-exit framework that accelerates Vision-Language Action models for autonomous driving by terminating inference when trajectories meet physical feasibility criteria, achieving up to 29% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Action models suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks, which limits their practical deployment in real-time autonomous driving applications.

Method: Uses action-guided early-exit with physical feasibility evaluation (Navigation or Low-precision Planning priors with <2m deviation tolerance) and a multi-hop controller that skips redundant layers based on score change rates.

Result: Achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction on Bench2Drive benchmark while preserving planning quality and safety.

Conclusion: DeeAD provides an effective training-free acceleration solution for VLA models that maintains performance while significantly reducing inference latency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

TL;DR: FMD compresses large SSL foundation models into compact proxies that retain general-purpose representational power, with Foundry as the first implementation for 3D point clouds using SuperTokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models are computationally expensive for edge devices, and existing compression methods sacrifice the downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models valuable.

Method: Foundry trains a student model to learn compressed SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space.

Result: A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks (classification, part segmentation, few-shot scenarios), approaching full foundation-model performance with significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs.

Conclusion: FMD enables practical deployment of compressed foundation models on resource-constrained hardware while preserving their general-purpose representational capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer is a DINOv2-based model for detecting manipulated regions in generative inpainting, using patch embeddings and linear classification to achieve state-of-the-art localization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting that can handle various post-processing operations and outperform existing approaches.

Method: Builds on DINOv2 pretrained on B-Free dataset, adds linear classification head on patch embeddings for 14×14 resolution prediction, uses sliding-window strategy for larger images, and post-processes heatmaps into binary masks.

Result: Achieves 12% higher IoU than next best model, remains robust to resizing, noise addition, and JPEG compression, and shows superiority over DINOv3 in ablation studies.

Conclusion: DINOv2-based Vision Transformers demonstrate strong representational power for manipulation localization, with DinoLizer establishing new state-of-the-art performance across various inpainting datasets.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS is a new benchmark for evaluating vision language models' ability to perform tool-based user interface design tasks through software tool invocations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existing benchmark evaluates VLMs' capacity to operate design software and iteratively refine UI designs, which is important for understanding their potential to collaborate with designers.

Method: Created CANVAS benchmark with 598 tool-based design tasks from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 categories, featuring two task types: design replication (reproducing whole screens) and design modification (modifying specific parts).

Result: Leading models demonstrate more strategic tool invocations that improve design quality, and common error patterns were identified to guide future improvements.

Conclusion: CANVAS enables systematic evaluation of VLMs' tool-based design capabilities and provides insights for enhancing their performance in UI design tasks.

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

TL;DR: TIE is a text-guided semantic image encoder that generates image representations conditioned on text queries, improving vision-language model performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision-language models use image encoders pretrained independently, processing images agnostically without considering downstream tasks or text queries, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE) that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries, enabling query-specific processing.

Result: VLMs with TIE outperform conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine benchmarks at 1B and 3B scales, with up to 6-point gains on DocVQA and InfoVQA, while using only half the image tokens for improved efficiency.

Conclusion: TIE effectively optimizes encoders to capture key visual features relevant to queries, enhances interpretability and query-specific grounding, and generalizes well with generic queries.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

Conclusion: Partial convolution shows advantages in spatial reasoning under missing data, establishing a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding in robotics, simulation, and material perception applications.

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

TL;DR: LongVT is an agentic framework that enables multimodal reasoning with long videos through interleaved Chain-of-Tool-Thought, using LMMs' temporal grounding as a native cropping tool for global-to-local video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models struggle with hallucinations when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed, unlike human comprehension that skims globally then examines relevant clips.

Method: Uses LMMs' temporal grounding ability as native video cropping tool to zoom in on specific clips, resample finer-grained frames, and perform global-to-local reasoning loops until answers are visually grounded. Includes three-stage training with supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines across four challenging long-video understanding benchmarks. Created VideoSIAH dataset with 247.9K training samples and 1,280 evaluation QA pairs.

Conclusion: LongVT effectively addresses hallucination issues in long-video reasoning through agentic multimodal tool use and global-to-local reasoning, demonstrating superior performance on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

Motivation: The original KRISP model is computationally demanding and designed for industrial-scale training, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. This work aims to create a more accessible version.

Method: Reimplement KRISP with significantly fewer parameters, conduct systematic ablation studies, evaluate on synthetic VQA data and DAQUAR dataset, and constrain outputs to external knowledge graph domain.

Result: The replicated model performs about 75% of the original KRISP while being much more lightweight. It prevents AI hallucinations by generating outputs only within the constrained knowledge domain.

Conclusion: The lightweight KRISP reproduction enables visual reasoning on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, improves offline capabilities, and reveals important design flaws not covered in the original paper.

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

### [58] [Intriguing Properties of Dynamic Sampling Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20800)
*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified theoretical framework called "warping" that generalizes dynamic sampling methods in deep learning, analyzes their statistical properties, and reveals training asymmetries between forward and backward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the theoretical analysis of various dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures, which have demonstrated utility but lack a cohesive theoretical foundation.

Method: Developed a novel "warping" operator that generalizes existing dynamic sampling methods, performed statistical analysis modeling inputs as IID variables and homogeneous random fields, and introduced gradient-based loss landscape visualization.

Result: Discovered unique asymmetry between forward and backward passes, established that dynamic sampling represents a different class of orthogonal operators compared to traditional convolutions, and identified conditions for stable training of dynamic sampling networks.

Conclusion: The warping framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for analyzing dynamic sampling methods, reveals important training dynamics, and enables better understanding of learning behavior through novel visualization techniques.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

*Kriti Ghosh,Devjyoti Chakraborty,Lakshmish Ramaswamy,Suchendra M. Bhandarkar,In Kee Kim,Nancy O'Hare,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF is a modular residual framework for incremental refinement of Neural Radiance Fields that enables efficient updates without catastrophic forgetting, achieving comparable performance to joint training with 30-42% faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most NeRF frameworks require complete retraining for new views, limiting applicability in sequential data scenarios like satellite terrain analysis. Incremental refinement is underexplored and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes Δ-NeRF with: (1) residual controller for per-layer corrections to frozen base NeRF, (2) uncertainty-aware gating to prevent overcorrection, (3) view selection reducing training data by 47%, and (4) knowledge distillation for model compression to 20% original size.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to joint training with 30-42% faster training time. Outperforms baselines by up to 43.5% PSNR over naive fine-tuning, surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF provides an effective solution for incremental NeRF refinement without catastrophic forgetting, making it suitable for sequential data applications like satellite imagery analysis.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

*Ozgur Kara,Yujia Chen,Ming-Hsuan Yang,James M. Rehg,Wen-Sheng Chu,Du Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) is a novel framework that enhances control in generative video composition by splitting unlabeled videos into foreground/background layers and self-composing them to learn compositional dynamics, addressing data scarcity without annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data scarcity problem in generative video composition and enhance control over dynamic subject-scene interactions, avoiding reliance on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules.

Method: Splits unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them using transformation-aware training with multi-layer fusion, augmentation for affordance-aware composition, and identity-preservation loss for foreground fidelity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative benchmarks and human/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: StM successfully learns complex compositional dynamics for realistic video generation through self-supervised learning on unlabeled video data, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphinx is a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that generates puzzles with verifiable solutions. It evaluates 25 task types and shows state-of-the-art models perform poorly (51.1% accuracy), while reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating core cognitive primitives in visual perception and reasoning, addressing the limitations of current evaluation methods and enabling precise assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives with verifiable ground-truth solutions. Evaluates 25 task types covering symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction.

Result: State-of-the-art large vision-language models (including GPT-5) achieve only 51.1% accuracy, significantly below human performance.

Conclusion: Sphinx provides a rigorous benchmark for visual reasoning that reveals significant gaps in current models. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards shows promise for advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities, suggesting this approach could help bridge the performance gap between AI systems and human-level reasoning.

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

### [62] [Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20821)
*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVI replaces diffusion prior networks with optimization-based visual inversion, using novel constraints to improve image quality while exposing flaws in current evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models rely on computationally expensive prior networks that require massive training datasets. This work challenges the necessity of trained priors by proposing a training-free alternative.

Method: Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) initializes latent visual representations from random pseudo-tokens and optimizes them using cosine similarity with text embeddings, regularized by Mahalanobis-based and Nearest-Neighbor loss constraints.

Result: OVI serves as a viable alternative to traditional priors. The Nearest-Neighbor approach achieves quantitative scores comparable to or higher than state-of-the-art data-efficient priors, while exposing flaws in current evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OVI demonstrates that trained priors may not be necessary, with constrained optimization methods improving visual fidelity and achieving competitive performance, suggesting this approach merits further investigation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr is a 3D image-to-graph model for vascular centerline detection that uses recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories with a Producer-Refiner architecture, achieving high recall while reducing parameters by 2.4x compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate centerline detection with correct tree topology is critical for clinical applications like diagnosis and surgical navigation, where missing small branches can lead to fatal mistakes due to incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities.

Method: Uses Producer-Refiner architecture based on Transformer decoder: Producer proposes initial confluent trajectories, Refiner recurrently refines them to form centerline graph. Introduces efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches.

Result: Achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA across multiple public centerline datasets, with faster inference and substantially fewer parameters (2.4x reduction in decoder parameters).

Conclusion: RefTr demonstrates potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging, offering improved performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-resolution stereo DSLR dataset with 18,000 images captured across 50 optical configurations (10 focal lengths, 5 apertures) to address the lack of real optical data for depth estimation and related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, enabling better generalization and evaluation of depth estimation models in real-world conditions.

Method: Captured 18,000 high-resolution (5472×3648px) stereo images across 9 scenes with varying complexity, using two identical DSLR cameras systematically varying focal length (28-70mm) and aperture (f/2.8-f/22).

Result: Created the first large-scale, high-fidelity stereo DSLR dataset with full-range optics coverage, enabling controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for various computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset reveals challenges with current state-of-the-art methods and provides a foundation for reproducible research on real-world optical generalization in depth estimation and related fields.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first large-scale unsupervised dataset for visual memorability using 82,000+ videos with descriptive recall data from tip-of-the-tongue queries, enabling better recall generation and retrieval than state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual memorability research is limited by expensive human annotations, restricting dataset diversity and scalability. Existing datasets only capture aggregate scores, missing nuanced memorability signals from natural recall descriptions.

Method: Leveraged tip-of-the-tongue retrieval queries from online platforms like Reddit to create an unsupervised dataset. Used large vision-language models fine-tuned on this dataset and employed contrastive training for multimodal ToT retrieval.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperformed GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions. Created the first model capable of multimodal ToT retrieval using contrastive training strategy.

Conclusion: The dataset and models provide a novel direction for visual content memorability research, offering rich signals for recall generation and retrieval tasks that advance the field beyond traditional annotation limitations.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

### [66] [Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20865)
*Yining Ding,João F. C. Mota,Andrew M. Wallace,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to estimate fog parameters from stereo images using simultaneous optimization, handles inhomogeneous fog, and introduces SDIRF dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods estimate fog parameters sequentially, leading to error propagation. Real-world fog is often globally inhomogeneous, requiring better parameter estimation approaches.

Method: Simultaneous optimization of all fog parameters using stereo foggy images, assuming locally homogeneous fog. Can be integrated as add-on module in SLAM/odometry systems.

Result: Superior performance on both synthetic and real foggy data from SDIRF dataset. Produces most accurate estimates and better adaptation to real fog compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles real-world inhomogeneous fog and advances visual perception in foggy conditions. Code and SDIRF dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

TL;DR: V^2-SAM adapts SAM2 for cross-view object correspondence using two complementary prompt generators (geometry-aware and appearance-guided) with multi-expert selection, achieving SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models like SAM2 struggle with cross-view object correspondence due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations between ego-centric and exo-centric views.

Method: Two prompt generators: V^2-Anchor for geometry-aware coordinate-based prompting using DINOv3 features, and V^2-Visual for appearance-guided matching via feature and structural alignment. Multi-expert design with Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector for adaptive expert selection.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

Conclusion: V^2-SAM successfully adapts SAM2 for cross-view correspondence through complementary prompt generators and adaptive expert selection, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse cross-view scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Null-TTA aligns diffusion models by optimizing the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance to prevent reward hacking while maintaining cross-reward generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time alignment methods tend to either under-optimize or over-optimize (reward hack) the target reward function, exploiting non-semantic noise patterns.

Method: Optimize the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance rather than manipulating latent or noise variables, ensuring alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalization without updating model parameters.

Conclusion: Semantic-space optimization through Null-TTA establishes an effective and principled novel paradigm for test-time alignment.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

TL;DR: GaINeR is a geometry-aware implicit neural representation for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with neural networks to enable continuous representation, interpretable structure, and local editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional INRs lack explicit geometric structure and have limited local editing capabilities, restricting their use in dynamic or interactive settings.

Method: Combines trainable Gaussian distributions with neural networks - retrieves K nearest Gaussians for image coordinates, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts RGB values via neural network.

Result: Enables continuous image representation with interpretable geometric structure and flexible local editing capabilities.

Conclusion: GaINeR provides a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation by addressing limitations of traditional INRs.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning model successfully restores standard-dose MRI quality from low-dose (10-30% dose) cerebellopontine angle imaging, enabling accurate vestibular schwannoma detection and segmentation with significantly reduced contrast agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce contrast agent dose in MRI examinations while maintaining diagnostic quality, particularly for cerebellopontine angle imaging in vestibular schwannoma patients.

Method: Multi-center retrospective study using T1 and T1ce MRI data to simulate low-dose images, with DL models trained to restore standard-dose quality from reduced-dose inputs. Evaluation included image quality metrics and radiologist assessment.

Result: DL restoration improved image quality metrics significantly - SSIM increased from 0.639 to 0.993 and PSNR from 21.6 dB to 41.4 dB. At 10% dose, segmentation improved Dice from 0.673 to 0.734 and reduced distance metrics. Radiologists rated both 10% and 30% dose restorations as excellent, with 30% being more informative.

Conclusion: DL models enable high-quality cerebellopontine angle MRI with only 10-30% of standard contrast dose, making lesion detection and characterization possible with significantly reduced contrast agent exposure.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To instill strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures by leveraging natural temporal coherence in videos.

Method: Encourages smoothness in intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW), penalizing abrupt representational shifts.

Result: Achieves 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600, with MoViNets improving state-of-the-art by 3.8% to 6.1% within FLOP constraints, and MobileNetV3/MoViNets-Stream gaining 4.9% to 6.4% over prior models.

Conclusion: The proposed smooth regularization effectively captures complex temporal dynamics in lightweight video recognition models, significantly boosting performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

### [72] [Open Vocabulary Compositional Explanations for Neuron Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20931)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for open vocabulary compositional explanations of neurons in vision models, using semantic segmentation masks instead of human annotations to enable probing arbitrary concepts and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compositional explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, limiting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. The goal is to overcome this limitation by enabling explanations for arbitrary concepts and datasets.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Specify arbitrary concepts, 2) Generate semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, 3) Derive compositional explanations from these masks.

Result: The framework enables compositional explanations for arbitrary concepts and datasets, provides flexibility in explanations for different tasks and properties, and shows differences when shifting from human-annotated to model-annotated data.

Conclusion: The proposed open vocabulary framework successfully addresses the limitations of previous compositional explanation methods by enabling flexible, dataset-agnostic neuron explanations using semantic segmentation masks.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

### [73] [UruDendro4: A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Tree-Ring Detection in Cross-Section Images of Pinus taeda L](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20935)
*Henry Marichal,Joaquin Blanco,Diego Passarella,Gregory Randall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UruDendro4, a new dataset of 102 Pinus taeda L. wood cross-section images with manual ring annotations, enabling volumetric growth modeling. It provides baseline performance for automatic ring detection using DeepCS-TRD method and shows improved model generalization when including this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual measurement of tree-ring growth is time-consuming and imprecise. Existing datasets are scarce and lack samples from multiple stem heights needed for volumetric modeling of annual wood growth.

Method: Created UruDendro4 dataset with 102 Pinus taeda L. cross-section images manually annotated with annual rings, collected at multiple stem heights. Evaluated state-of-the-art ring detection methods including DeepCS-TRD and conducted ablation experiments for parameter validation.

Result: DeepCS-TRD achieved best performance with 0.838 mAP, 0.782 mAR, and 0.084 ARE. Training models with this dataset improved generalization in tree-ring detection tasks.

Conclusion: UruDendro4 addresses data scarcity for volumetric growth modeling and provides a valuable benchmark for automated tree-ring detection algorithms, with demonstrated improvements in model generalization.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

*Rawa Mohammed,Mina Attin,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework for breast ultrasound report generation that doesn't require paired image-report data, using structured descriptors and radiomics features with descriptor-aware visual representations and dual-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated radiology report generation for breast ultrasound is limited by lack of paired image-report datasets and risk of hallucinations from large language models.

Method: Constructs reports from structured descriptors (BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features; uses multi-head Swin encoder with multitask loss; aligns visual and textual tokens via dual-level objective combining token-level cross-entropy with cosine-similarity alignment loss.

Result: Consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics across two public BUS datasets (BrEaST and BUS-BRA), particularly for key targets like BI-RADS category and pathology.

Conclusion: Descriptor-aware vision model trained with combined token-level and alignment loss improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

### [75] [Beyond Realism: Learning the Art of Expressive Composition with StickerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20957)
*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StickerNet is a two-stage framework for expressive image composition that learns from real-world user editing behavior to predict placement parameters like opacity, mask, location, and scale, prioritizing artistic expression over realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image composition focuses on realism, but modern content creation often aims for artistic, playful, or socially engaging compositions. This work addresses the gap by studying how users actually edit images on creative platforms.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) determines composition type, 2) predicts placement parameters (opacity, mask, location, scale). Dataset built from 1.8M real user editing actions from an online platform.

Result: StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior in user studies and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness despite task ambiguity.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism, showing the value of learning from real-world editing patterns.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

*Md Adnan Arefeen,Biplob Debnath,Srimat Chakradhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrafficLens is a novel algorithm for efficient multi-camera traffic video analysis that reduces video-to-text conversion time by 4x while maintaining accuracy through sequential VLM processing and object-level similarity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing multi-camera traffic feeds using LLMs require time-consuming video-to-text conversion via VLMs, causing delays in generating timely insights and investigating incidents.

Method: TrafficLens uses a sequential approach leveraging overlapping camera coverage, iteratively applying VLMs with varying token limits and using previous outputs as prompts. It also employs object-level similarity detection to bypass redundant VLM invocations.

Result: Experimental results show TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to 4x while maintaining information accuracy compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: TrafficLens provides an efficient solution for real-time multi-camera traffic analysis, enabling faster insights and incident investigation while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers with homomorphic encryption for secure medical image classification, achieving 30x communication reduction while preventing model inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations like HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing in healthcare, and conventional federated learning gradients remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose sensitive medical information.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers with CLS tokens as compact 768-dimensional feature representations, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to server for secure aggregation.

Result: Achieves 96.12% global classification accuracy (unencrypted) and 90.02% (encrypted), with only 326 KB encrypted data per round. Prevents model inversion attacks that successfully reconstruct images from gradients (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741).

Conclusion: The CLS-protected HE approach provides strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high accuracy, enabling secure multi-institutional collaboration for medical AI without raw data sharing.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

*Yingying Deng,Xiangyu He,Fan Tang,Weiming Dong,Xucheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an inversion-free style transfer framework using dual rectified flows that eliminates computational inversion processes, enabling efficient stylization with only forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based style transfer methods that rely on computationally expensive inversion processes, which compromise efficiency and introduce visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate.

Method: Uses dual rectified flows to predict content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. Includes attention injection for style integration guidance.

Result: Achieves robust fusion without naive overlays, demonstrates generalization across diverse styles and content, provides effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer with enhanced visual fidelity and content preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion-free framework based on dual rectified flows offers an efficient and effective solution for style transfer, overcoming computational bottlenecks and visual distortion issues of inversion-based methods while maintaining high quality results.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Ref-COD framework that distills references into class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes reference vectors at inference without requiring test-time references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-COD systems use dual-branch designs that require reference images at test time, limiting deployability and adding latency and data-collection burden.

Method: Maintain EMA-updated prototypes per category, predict mixture weights from query to produce guidance vector, and use bidirectional attention alignment to bridge representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features.

Result: Extensive experiments on R2C7K benchmark demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Proposed approach provides a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references at test time.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

TL;DR: WavePCNet is a physics-driven network that uses complex amplitude modeling and frequency-selective pathways to accurately localize and segment obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture coherent light propagation physics and converge to non-physical solutions under low signal-to-noise conditions, compromising stability and reliability of obscured object observation.

Method: Proposes WavePCNet with Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection for precise coherent propagation constraints, momentum memory mechanism for perturbation suppression, and High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement for frequency-selective pathways and structural consistency modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on four physically collected datasets show WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: WavePCNet effectively addresses challenges in obscured object localization and segmentation through physics-driven wavefront propagation modeling and compensation mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance under complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large reasoning models can produce unsafe content in intermediate reasoning traces even when final answers are non-harmful, creating deployment risks that current safety methods miss by only checking inputs and final outputs.

Method: Developed GuardTrace-VL using joint image-text analysis to monitor the full Question-Thinking-Answer pipeline, trained on the GuardTrace dataset generated through diverse prompting and refined via MLRM/human voting, with a three-stage progressive training scheme.

Result: Achieved 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection, representing 13.5% improvement over previous multimodal safety methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain test scenarios.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL effectively detects unsafe content in multimodal reasoning processes, addressing critical safety gaps in current deployment practices for MLRMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Image layer decomposition enables independent editing of elements but remains challenging due to limited methods and data. The authors observe a connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks.

Method: Adapt a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. Introduce a multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity to preserve detail in latent space. Train purely on synthetic dataset from open-source assets.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully adapts inpainting models for layer decomposition, demonstrating strong performance on editing tasks using only synthetic training data.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing news image captioning methods struggle with incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding, limiting their ability to produce journalistically informative descriptions.

Method: MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge. It uses a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy for cross-modal alignment and dynamic retrieval guided by image content for visual-entity matching.

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates strong robustness and domain adaptability, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in news image captioning by effectively addressing key challenges through its multimodal entity-aware retrieval-augmented approach.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

*Yuhang Liu,Wenjie Zhao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaRank is a meta-learning framework that automatically selects the best Model Transferability Estimation metric for a given target dataset using textual descriptions and learned ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTE metric selection is ad hoc and no single metric works optimally across all datasets, requiring a task-aware approach.

Method: Formulates metric selection as learning-to-rank, encodes dataset and metric descriptions with pretrained language models, trains meta-predictor offline with listwise ranking objective.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 datasets show strong effectiveness in selecting optimal MTE metrics.

Conclusion: MetaRank provides an efficient, automatic solution for task-aware MTE metric selection, outperforming ad hoc approaches.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel trustworthy multi-view classification framework using prototypes to represent neighbor structures, enabling efficient cross-view consensus discovery and dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TMVC methods rely on globally dense neighbor relationships leading to high computational costs and lack guarantees for consistency across inter-view relationships, undermining classification trustworthiness.

Method: Introduces prototypes to represent neighbor structures of each view, simplifying intra-view neighbor relation learning and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structures.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus while improving computational efficiency and trustworthiness of classification outcomes.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

*Qirui Yang,Yang Yang,Ying Zeng,Xiaobin Hu,Bo Li,Huanjing Yue,Jingyu Yang,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster is a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching that explicitly decouples camera directives from parameter embeddings to achieve precise camera control while maintaining semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models struggle with physically consistent image retouching using precise camera parameters. Current methods either rely on ambiguous text prompts that hinder precise control, or use separate training heads that compromise scalability and sensitivity to subtle variations.

Method: CameraMaster decouples camera directive and parameter embeddings, using parameter embeddings to modulate both directive and content semantics. It injects modulated directives via cross-attention and uses directive/camera embeddings as conditioning signals in time embedding for unified layer-wise modulation throughout denoising.

Result: CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods. The framework was trained on a dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs with camera parameter annotations.

Conclusion: CameraMaster successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a unified framework that enables precise camera parameter control while maintaining semantic consistency, demonstrating superior performance in image retouching tasks.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaptionQA is a utility-based benchmark that evaluates image captions by measuring how well they support downstream tasks, revealing significant gaps between image and caption utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current caption evaluation methods don't assess whether captions can effectively substitute for images in real downstream applications like retrieval, recommendation, and AI inference pipelines.

Method: Built an extensible benchmark with 33,027 multiple-choice questions across 4 domains (Natural, Document, E-commerce, Embodied AI) with fine-grained taxonomies. Uses LLMs to answer questions using captions alone to measure utility.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs show substantial utility gaps between images and their captions, with models performing nearly identically on traditional benchmarks differing by up to 32% in caption utility.

Conclusion: CaptionQA provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating caption utility in downstream tasks, revealing current captioning models' limitations in preserving image-level utility for practical applications.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing music-to-dance generation methods have limited generation efficiency, leaving insufficient computational resources for high-fidelity 3D rendering in real-world applications like virtual reality and digital entertainment.

Method: Combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints for high-quality motion generation with few sampling steps, and uses a BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion in a non-autoregressive manner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on AIST++ and FineDance datasets in both motion quality and generation efficiency, with significant improvements in inference speed and memory utilization.

Conclusion: FlowerDance enables efficient and high-quality music-to-dance generation suitable for real-world applications, while also supporting interactive motion editing capabilities.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: LungNoduleAgent is a collaborative multi-agent system that improves lung cancer diagnosis by accurately identifying nodules, generating comprehensive CT reports, and performing malignancy reasoning through specialized modules working together.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise, limiting their reliability in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer potential for balancing generality and precision in medical applications.

Method: Three-module system: 1) Nodule Spotter coordinates detection models to identify nodules, 2) Radiologist integrates localized image description for CT reports, 3) Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning using images, reports, pathology knowledge base, and multi-agent framework.

Result: Extensive testing on private datasets and LIDC-IDRI shows LungNoduleAgent outperforms mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models, demonstrating superior performance in lung nodule diagnosis.

Conclusion: The system highlights the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in nodule diagnosis, positioning LungNoduleAgent as a promising foundational tool for clinical lung nodule analysis.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

*Hakki Motorcu,Mujdat Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines generative models with physical constraints for spatially varying image deblurring, outperforming both model-based and generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either produce over-smoothed results with artifacts (model-based approaches) or hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints (generative models). There's a need to bridge the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism.

Method: Models degradation as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels to capture minute variations, then uses this descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture that strongly guides the diffusion sampling process.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods and generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconciles model-based and generative paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints for spatially varying image deblurring.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

TL;DR: MUSE is a unified framework for emotional image generation and editing that uses gradient-based optimization with off-the-shelf emotion classifiers, eliminating the need for specialized datasets or model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Image Emotional Synthesis approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling.

Method: MUSE addresses three key questions: (1) HOW to guide synthesis using gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens with an emotion classifier, (2) WHEN to introduce guidance using semantic similarity as supervisory signal, and (3) WHICH emotion to guide through multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent emotions.

Result: Experimental results show MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining optimal balance between content, text adherence, and emotional expression.

Conclusion: MUSE establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis by unifying generation and editing tasks through a Test-Time Scaling aligned strategy without requiring specialized datasets or model updates.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in maintaining disease-related characteristics during long-term AD predictions when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential imaging data.

Method: Uses Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution with time parameter (T-NIG) to estimate temporal parameters, employs coordinate neighborhoods for feature identification, and incorporates uncertainty estimation to reduce epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks, proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics despite irregular temporal data distribution.

Conclusion: T-NIG model effectively handles irregular time intervals in brain imaging sequences for Alzheimer's Disease prediction through temporal parameter estimation and uncertainty reduction.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing models often struggle with complex user instructions involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to semantic drift and inaccurate edits.

Method: MIRA uses an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop to predict atomic edit instructions step by step with visual feedback, trained on a 150K multimodal dataset (MIRA-Editing) using SFT + GRPO pipeline, and works with open-source editing models.

Result: MIRA significantly improves semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems like GPT-Image and Nano-Banana when paired with models like Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit.

Conclusion: MIRA provides an effective plug-and-play solution for accurate instruction-guided image editing by simulating human-model interaction processes through iterative reasoning.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

TL;DR: A novel iris authentication pipeline using 3D-CNN to capture spatio-temporal features from iris sequences, trained with curriculum learning for robust performance against rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iris authentication methods lack robustness to variations like rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur, and fail to effectively leverage spatio-temporal structure of iris patterns.

Method: Splits iris images into sequences for 3D-CNN processing, uses curriculum learning with triplet and ArcFace loss to capture spatio-temporal feature dynamics and embed temporal dependencies directly into feature space.

Result: The approach learns rich spatio-temporal representations that improve discriminability in deep metric domain, yielding robust and generalizable iris authentication despite challenging variations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust solution for iris authentication by effectively modeling spatio-temporal iris patterns through 3D-CNN and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

TL;DR: Pygmalion Effect in Vision framework transforms reflective objects into clay-like forms to improve 3D reconstruction by suppressing specular reflections while preserving geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection remains challenging in 3D reconstruction due to entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections, which hinders accurate reconstruction.

Method: Dual-branch network with BRDF-based reflective branch and clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals, trained jointly using synthesized clay-like images as reflection-free supervision.

Result: Substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Seeing by unshining and translating radiance into neutrality serves as powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Motivation: Radar sensors provide reliable perception in adverse conditions, but existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific, preventing transfer learning. Foundation models have transformed other domains but remain underexplored for radar.

Method: Uses structured caption framework to encode vehicle distributions in radar coordinates, hash-aware contrastive learning for continuous scene similarity, and generates large-scale annotated radar datasets using CARLA simulator.

Result: Proposes localization-aware metrics for spatial accuracy assessment beyond traditional detection measures.

Conclusion: RadarFM enables unified radar scene understanding and transfer learning across tasks through structured spatial language supervision.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EM-KD enhances Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a novel knowledge distillation approach that addresses unbalanced vision tokens between student and teacher models using Manhattan distance and Hungarian matching, followed by two distillation strategies: Vision-Language Affinity Distillation and Vision Semantic Distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficient MLLMs compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption but lose visual information, degrading comprehension. Prior knowledge distillation methods overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between efficient student and vanilla teacher models.

Method: 1) Calculate Manhattan distance between teacher and student vision logits and align them spatially using Hungarian matching algorithm. 2) Apply two distillation strategies: Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) that minimizes smooth L1 distance of affinity matrices between text and aligned vision tokens, and Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD) that uses reverse KL divergence to measure probability distributions of aligned vision logits over vocabulary space.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows EM-KD trained models outperform prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency by a large margin. When compared with previous distillation methods equipped with the same vision token matching strategy, EM-KD still achieves better performance.

Conclusion: EM-KD effectively addresses the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens in knowledge distillation for efficient MLLMs, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

TL;DR: FaithFusion is a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework that uses Expected Information Gain (EIG) to maintain geometric fidelity and visual plausibility in driving-scene reconstruction under large viewpoint shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in fusing geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models, which often lead to over-restoration and geometric drift due to lack of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria.

Method: Introduces Expected Information Gain (EIG) as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis, guiding diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions and using pixel-level weighting to distill edits back into 3DGS.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on Waymo dataset across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID metrics, maintaining FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Conclusion: FaithFusion provides an effective plug-and-play system for controllable driving-scene reconstruction that maintains geometric fidelity without requiring extra prior conditions or structural modifications.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift. Our code is available at https://github.com/wangyuanbiubiubiu/FaithFusion.

*Xin Honga,Jie Lin,Minghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DATGN is a novel method that uses temporal generative networks to predict Alzheimer's disease progression by generating future MRI images, addressing missing data issues and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to slow its progression, and current methods rely on manual feature extraction from brain images. There's a need for automated learning of morphological changes in brain images over time.

Method: DATGN first interpolates incomplete MRI sequences, then uses a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module to generate future MRI images that follow disease progression patterns, enabling early AD prediction.

Result: DATGN achieved competitive PSNR and MMSE metrics for MRI generation. When synthetic data was used with classification methods, accuracy improved significantly: 6.21% to 16% for AD vs. NC, and 7.34% to 21.25% for AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification.

Conclusion: DATGN successfully generates MRI images consistent with Alzheimer's brain atrophy trends, enabling early disease prediction and significantly improving classification performance when used as synthetic training data.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

*Changlin Li,Jiawei Zhang,Zeyi Shi,Zongxin Yang,Zhihui Li,Xiaojun Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntPruner is an entropy-guided automatic pruning framework for diffusion and flow models that reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining generation quality, achieving up to 2.22× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision generative models have significant parameter redundancy when transferred to downstream tasks, requiring efficient pruning methods that preserve output diversity and condition-fidelity.

Method: Uses entropy-guided pruning with Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) to assess block importance, and a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework that automatically determines pruning timing and amount during training.

Result: Achieves up to 2.22× inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets with DiT and SiT models.

Conclusion: EntPruner effectively reduces parameter redundancy in generative models through entropy-guided pruning, enabling faster inference without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

### [101] [CtrlVDiff: Controllable Video Generation via Unified Multimodal Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21129)
*Dianbing Xi,Jiepeng Wang,Yuanzhi Liang,Xi Qiu,Jialun Liu,Hao Pan,Yuchi Huo,Rui Wang,Haibin Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff is a unified diffusion model that tackles both video understanding and controllable generation by using multiple graphics-based modalities (depth, normals, segmentation, edges, intrinsics) to enable precise edits like relighting and material swaps while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry-only cues are insufficient for video understanding and generation as they under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits and causing temporal drift. Additional graphics-based modalities provide complementary constraints for better understanding and precise control.

Method: Proposes CtrlVDiff with Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from multiple modalities (depth, normals, segmentation, edges, albedo, roughness, metallic). Uses MMVideo dataset with aligned real-and-synthetic data across modalities and captions for training.

Result: Superior controllability and fidelity across understanding and generation benchmarks, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) while surpassing state-of-the-art baselines. Model remains robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Conclusion: Enriching video models with multiple graphics-based modalities enables both better understanding and precise, predictable control during generation, overcoming limitations of geometry-only approaches while maintaining temporal coherence.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [102] [DeepRFTv2: Kernel-level Learning for Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21132)
*Xintian Mao,Haofei Song,Yin-Nian Liu,Qingli Li,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) that enables deep networks to learn blur processes at kernel-level rather than pixel-level, achieving state-of-the-art motion deblurring through Fourier space activation and feature convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep networks only perform pixel-level restoration and fail to understand the essence of blur, which is fundamentally a convolution process with blur kernels. Learning at kernel-level should significantly improve deblurring performance.

Method: Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) with Fourier space activation converts spatial convolution to Fourier multiplication, jointly optimized with deblur model. Uses feature convolution instead of image convolution, and employs decoupled multi-scale architecture with reversible sub-unets for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results, shows potential for other kernel-related problems, and learns physically meaningful kernels without additional supervision.

Conclusion: FKE enables kernel-level blur process learning with low complexity, providing better understanding of blur essence and superior deblurring performance compared to pixel-level approaches.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost and memory consumption of training diffusion models on high-resolution, multi-frame human video data pose significant challenges.

Method: Uses Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess component importance for prioritized training, and an adaptive progressive schedule that increases computational complexity based on convergence efficiency.

Result: Achieves up to 2.2× training speedup and 2.4× GPU memory reduction across three datasets without compromising generative performance.

Conclusion: Ent-Prog effectively reduces training costs for human video generation while maintaining model quality through efficient prioritization and adaptive scheduling.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

### [104] [AnchorOPT: Towards Optimizing Dynamic Anchors for Adaptive Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21188)
*Zheng Li,Yibing Song,Xin Zhang,Lei Luo,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorOPT introduces dynamic anchors in prompt learning by learning anchor values from task-specific data and optimizing positional relationships between anchors and soft tokens, achieving performance gains without additional modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods use static textual tokens as anchors, which lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility, limiting their generalization capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training: first learn anchor tokens from task-specific data, then freeze them and optimize soft tokens and a learnable position matrix that adapts to training stage and task context.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding methods with additional learnable modules or regularization techniques, with consistent gains across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: AnchorOPT provides a plug-and-play dynamic anchor framework that enhances CLIP generalization through adaptive anchor values and positions, offering improved flexibility over static approaches.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

### [105] [Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21139)
*Baoli Sun,Xinzhu Ma,Ning Wang,Zhihui Wang,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProxyFormer is a novel RVOS architecture that uses proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics, enabling better cross-modality alignment and inter-frame dependency modeling for improved video object segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods have limitations: (1) conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency modeling, making target tracking difficult amid frame variations; (2) late integration of textual constraints may cause video features to focus on non-referred objects.

Method: Introduces proxy queries that integrate visual and text semantics, progressively updated across video encoder stages. Decouples cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions to reduce computation. Uses Joint Semantic Consistency training to align proxy queries with video-text pairs.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four RVOS benchmarks demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ProxyFormer effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches by enabling dynamic evolution of proxy queries, establishing inter-frame dependencies, and ensuring video features focus on referred objects through early semantic integration.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: TEAR is an automated red-teaming framework that uncovers safety risks in Text-to-Video models by exploiting temporal dynamics through temporal-aware test generation and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation methods for static image and text generation are insufficient for capturing complex temporal dynamics in video generation, creating critical safety challenges in T2V models.

Method: Uses temporal-aware test generator with two-stage optimization (initial training + temporal-aware online preference learning) and cyclic refinement to craft stealthy prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating videos.

Result: Achieves over 80% attack success rate across open-source and commercial T2V systems, significantly outperforming prior best result of 57%.

Conclusion: TEAR effectively exposes safety vulnerabilities in T2V models by targeting their temporal dynamics, demonstrating the need for specialized safety evaluation methods for video generation systems.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3 introduces Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) to enable efficient native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, achieving competitive performance with 2.4x faster TTFT than MoonViT and 1.9x faster than Qwen2-VL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs enhances capability but incurs significant computational overhead, creating a need for more efficient visual encoding methods.

Method: Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) with two modules: refined patch embedding for flexible patch-size scaling, and windowed token compression hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations.

Result: ViT-UHD (transformed ViT) achieves competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT by 2.4x. LLaVA-UHD v3 achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

Conclusion: PVC enables efficient native-resolution encoding while preserving generality, offering a promising approach for future efficient MLLM research.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

*Jiyun Bae,Hyunjong Ok,Sangwoo Mo,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual distractors in VLMs cause inverse scaling (reduced accuracy without increased reasoning length), unlike textual distractors. The Idis dataset reveals these effects across semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions, with attribute counting in reasoning traces providing key insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether visual distractors in vision-language models cause similar inverse scaling effects as observed in language models with textual distractors, and to understand how distractors affect multimodal reasoning.

Method: Created Idis dataset with systematic visual distractors across semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Analyzed reasoning traces and attribute counts to understand distractor effects. Extended analysis to Waterbirds benchmark and proposed prompting strategies.

Result: Visual distractors cause inverse scaling but differ from textual ones: accuracy decreases without increased reasoning length. Attribute counting in reasoning traces reveals how distractors affect model performance. Similar effects found in Waterbirds benchmark.

Conclusion: Visual distractors fundamentally differ from textual distractors in their effects on VLMs. Tracking attribute counts in reasoning provides valuable insights, and simple prompting strategies can help mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual autoregressive models that uses grid-partitioned progressive generation with early pruning and layout-specified prompt reformulation to improve image generation quality while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time computation scaling has shown success in language models but remains unexplored for visual AR models. Naive approaches like Best-of-N are suboptimal due to full-length computation on erroneous trajectories and lack of canvas blueprint in raster-scan decoding.

Method: GridAR employs grid-partitioned progressive generation where multiple partial candidates are generated, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones become anchors for subsequent decoding. It also uses layout-specified prompt reformulation to infer feasible layouts from partial views.

Result: With N=4, GridAR outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also shows comparable edit quality and 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: GridAR effectively addresses the limitations of test-time scaling for visual AR models, achieving higher-quality results with reduced computational costs and demonstrating generalization to image editing tasks.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D provides a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM that bridges language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding through a compact and unified design.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

TL;DR: UPA-RFAS is a universal adversarial patch attack framework for Vision-Language-Action models that achieves cross-model transferability through robust feature learning, attention hijacking, and semantic misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial patches for VLA models overfit to specific models and fail in black-box settings, creating a need for universal and transferable attacks that work across different architectures and real-world conditions.

Method: Combines feature-space objectives with L1 deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss, two-phase min-max optimization with invisible perturbations, and VLA-specific attention dominance and semantic misalignment losses.

Result: UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across diverse VLA models, tasks, and viewpoints in both simulation and physical execution, demonstrating practical attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework exposes a significant patch-based attack surface for VLA-driven robots and establishes a strong baseline for developing future defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels.

TL;DR: G²VLM is a geometry-grounded vision-language model that bridges 3D spatial reconstruction and spatial understanding by leveraging learned 3D visual geometry features to enhance spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models lack robustness in spatial intelligence due to the absence of visual geometry learning capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images.

Method: G²VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. It trains on abundant multi-view image and video data while leveraging 3D visual priors.

Result: G²VLM achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieves better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, G²VLM serves as a strong baseline for the community and can unlock future applications like 3D scene editing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

*Hanyang Li,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCBoost is a parameter-free plug-in that enhances global feature structures in deep clustering models by using reliable local structural cues to improve clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep clustering methods suffer from disparity between well-structured local features and poorly separated global features, leading to intertwined cluster boundaries.

Method: Uses adaptive k-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering to identify high-confidence samples as anchors, then applies a discriminative loss to promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Significantly improves clustering performance across various benchmarks, boosting state-of-the-art baselines by over 3% and amplifying silhouette coefficient by 7x.

Conclusion: DCBoost effectively bridges the gap between local and global feature structures in deep clustering, providing substantial performance improvements without additional parameters.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

*Selene Cerna,Sara Si-Moussi,Wilfried Thuiller,Hadrien Hendrikx,Vincent Miele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BotaCLIP is a lightweight multimodal framework that adapts pre-trained Earth Observation foundation models to inject botanical domain knowledge through contrastive learning, improving ecological modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt pre-trained foundation models for domain-specific applications without expensive retraining, specifically for biodiversity modeling where ecological knowledge needs to be incorporated into representations.

Method: BotaCLIP aligns high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés using contrastive learning and regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting, creating transferable embeddings for downstream tasks.

Result: BotaCLIP representations consistently outperformed DOFA and supervised baselines in plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation.

Conclusion: Domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can effectively inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling efficient representation learning for specialized applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

*Baoli Sun,Yihan Wang,Xinzhu Ma,Zhihui Wang,Kun Lu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ART framework for fine-grained action recognition using query-response mechanism to track distinctive local details through action tracklets with text-constrained semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action recognition methods capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions that evolve over time, which is crucial for distinguishing similar fine-grained actions.

Method: Proposes Action-Region Tracking (ART) with region-specific semantic activation module using text-constrained queries from VLMs, organizes responses into action tracklets, and applies multi-level tracklet contrastive constraints with task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on action recognition benchmarks demonstrate superiority over previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The ART framework effectively captures and tracks distinctive local details through action tracklets with text-constrained semantics, enabling better discrimination of fine-grained actions.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative study of DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow generative models showing CFM outperforms DDPM (FID 24.15 vs 402.98), while MeanFlow enables single-step generation with FID 29.15 and 50X faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare different generative modeling paradigms and their sampling efficiency, particularly focusing on reducing iterative sampling requirements while maintaining generation quality.

Method: Implemented DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow using unified TinyUNet architecture on CIFAR-10, with CFM extended to image inpainting using four mask types and mask-guided sampling.

Result: CFM achieved FID 24.15 (vs DDPM's 402.98), MeanFlow achieved FID 29.15 with single-step sampling (50X faster inference). Inpainting model improved PSNR from 4.95 to 8.57 dB (+73%) and SSIM from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%).

Conclusion: CFM significantly outperforms DDPM in generation quality, while MeanFlow enables efficient single-step generation with minimal quality loss. Inpainting-aware training substantially improves reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

*Shuhan Xia,Xuannan Liu,Xing Cui,Peipei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T3-Tracer is a novel framework for detecting partial audio forgeries by jointly analyzing audio at frame, segment, and audio levels using two complementary modules: FA-FAM for frame-level detection and SMDAM for segment-level boundary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial audio forgery is challenging to detect because attackers modify only critical frames while maintaining overall authenticity. Existing methods focus on single-frame detection and lack hierarchical structure to capture anomalies across different temporal levels.

Method: T3-Tracer uses two core modules: FA-FAM combines frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global inconsistencies. SMDAM uses a dual-branch architecture with multi-scale temporal windows to detect forgery boundaries at segment level.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting partial audio forgeries.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by capturing both transient and sustained anomalies across frame, segment, and audio levels, providing comprehensive detection of partial audio forgery traces.

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Chen Ling,Henglin Shi,Hedvig Kjellström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIELDS is a 3D face reconstruction method that captures subtle emotional details by combining 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression supervision and emotion recognition, using authentic 4D facial scan data to bridge the 2D/3D domain gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods miss subtle emotional details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth, failing to capture authentic facial expressions in communication.

Method: Extends self-supervised 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression parameter supervision from spontaneous 4D facial scans, plus an auxiliary emotion recognition branch with intensity-aware emotion loss to prevent exaggeration.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance while maintaining naturalness.

Conclusion: The dual-supervision strategy effectively bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, enabling emotion-rich 3D face models from single images.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs lack shift equivariance and invariance due to downsampling/upsampling operations. While data augmentation helps empirically, a systematic theoretical approach is needed to guarantee these properties.

Method: Extends LPS to complex-valued networks with a novel projection layer from ℂ to ℝ before Gumbel Softmax, theoretically guaranteeing shift equivariance and invariance properties.

Result: Evaluated on computer vision tasks using polarimetric SAR images, achieving shift invariance in classification and shift equivariance in reconstruction and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Successfully extends LPS framework to complex-valued neural networks, providing theoretical guarantees for shift equivariance and invariance in practical computer vision applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world audio-video forgery scenarios across both human and general subjects.

Method: Proposed a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework integrating proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. Created a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery type classification, detail selection, and explanatory reasoning.

Result: Evaluated 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models and 2 detection methods, showing AV-LMMs' potential as emerging forgery detectors but revealing notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench establishes a comprehensive benchmark for audio-video forgery detection, highlighting both the promise and current limitations of AV-LMMs in detecting diverse forgery scenarios beyond traditional DeepFakes.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaGen is the first framework for autoregressive long-horizon LiDAR scene generation that can generate high-fidelity 4D point clouds frame-by-frame from single-frame input using bounding box conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR generation methods only support single frame generation, while prediction approaches require multiple historical frames and lack interactivity, failing to support long-horizon interactive generation.

Method: LaGen uses a single-frame LiDAR input with bounding box conditions, features a scene decoupling estimation module for object-level interactive generation, and a noise modulation module to reduce error accumulation in long sequences.

Result: LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on later frames, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on nuScenes-based evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: LaGen successfully enables frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes, addressing limitations of existing methods and showing superior performance in generating high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

TL;DR: MatchGS corrects 3DGS geometric inaccuracies to generate precise correspondence labels and aligns 2D-3D representations, enabling robust zero-shot image matching with up to 17.7% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis but has geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering that prevent robust correspondence labeling for image matching training.

Method: Two-fold approach: (1) geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline refining 3DGS geometry for precise correspondence labels, (2) 2D-3D representation alignment strategy infusing 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into 2D matchers.

Result: Generated ground-truth correspondences reduce epipolar error by up to 40x, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals. Matchers trained on this data achieve up to 17.7% zero-shot performance improvements on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: With proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source for robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model for multiple remote sensing tasks through multi-task learning, addressing the limitations of single-task approaches and leveraging vision-language models' potential for improved generalization and practical applicability.

Method: Developed data curation engine for vision-language conversations, unified dynamic-resolution strategy for diverse image scales, Zoom-in Chain mechanism for ultra-high-resolution images, and enhanced object detection capability with novel evaluation protocol.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse remote sensing tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and rivaling specialized expert models.

Conclusion: RSCoVLM serves as an effective baseline that promotes progress toward general-purpose remote sensing models, with all tools, models, and datasets open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformers for road segmentation have quadratic complexity that limits deployment on resource-constrained platforms, while road networks inherently require modeling long, continuous structures where State Space Models like Mamba excel.

Method: Hybrid architecture integrating Mamba blocks to trace continuous road networks and preserve topological structure, combined with Transformer blocks to refine features with global context.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets, significantly improves topological continuity (APLS metric) while remaining computationally competitive.

Conclusion: PathMamba demonstrates that combining Mamba's sequential modeling with Transformer's global reasoning achieves superior topological road segmentation without prohibitive scaling costs, establishing a new benchmark for efficient and accurate road extraction.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

TL;DR: CaliTex addresses cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation by introducing geometry-calibrated attention modules that explicitly align attention with 3D structure, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation systems suffer from cross-view inconsistency due to attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention causes geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling.

Method: Introduces CaliTex with two modules: Part-Aligned Attention for spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention that routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways. Uses a two-stage diffusion transformer.

Result: Empirically produces seamless and view-consistent textures, outperforming both open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization, effectively addressing cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

*Weitian Wang,Lukas Meiner,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTTM is a training-free 3D token merging method that accelerates VGGT by merging tokens at multi-head granularity, preserving feature uniqueness and leveraging spatial-temporal correlations for up to 7x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT's joint inference of 3D attributes requires global attention layers that cause significant latency bottlenecks for large scenes with long-sequence inputs, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Head-wise temporal merging (HTTM) merges tokens in multi-head granularity rather than uniformly across attention heads, preserving feature uniqueness after head concatenation and leveraging spatial locality and temporal correspondence at the head level.

Result: HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in GPU-based inference, outperforming existing merging techniques that suffer from identical tokens and reduced representational ability.

Conclusion: HTTM provides an effective training-free solution for accelerating VGGT's 3D scene reconstruction by addressing the limitations of uniform token merging through multi-head granularity merging, enabling practical deployment of joint 3D attribute inference.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

TL;DR: ConFu is a multimodal learning framework that embeds individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified space, using contrastive learning with additional fused-modality objectives to capture higher-order dependencies while maintaining pairwise relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods either focus on pairwise alignment or inadequately preserve pairwise relationships when capturing higher-order interactions, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks.

Method: Extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with fused-modality contrastive terms that align modality pairs with a third modality, enabling joint embedding of individual modalities and their fused combinations.

Result: Competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, with ability to capture higher-order dependencies like XOR-like relationships and support unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval.

Conclusion: ConFu successfully addresses the challenge of learning joint multimodal representations by capturing higher-order dependencies while preserving pairwise correspondence, enabling effective performance across various multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFT-SNN framework combines SIFT feature encoding with SNN classification for real-time structural anomaly detection in transport infrastructure, achieving 92.3% accuracy with 9.5ms latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for low-latency, low-power real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure that can operate efficiently on embedded hardware while providing interpretable decisions.

Method: Hybrid pipeline integrating Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with latency-driven spike conversion and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network for classification.

Result: 92.3% classification accuracy with 9.5ms per-frame inference time and 8.1% sparse spike activity on Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset with 6,000 labeled frames.

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN enables real-time, low-power edge deployment with preserved spatial feature grounding and enhanced interpretability, though generalization to unseen field conditions needs validation.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

*Qing Li,Huifang Feng,Kanle Shi,Yue Gao,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel feature extraction method for robust normal estimation in point clouds using multi-scale feature fusion to address patch size selection issues, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with selecting appropriate neighborhood sizes for different data/geometries and have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds.

Method: Proposes Patch Feature Fitting (PFF) using multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation to approximate optimal geometric descriptions for normal estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and reduced running time.

Conclusion: The multi-scale feature fusion approach enables scale adaptation for varying local patches and delivers optimal feature descriptions for robust normal estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

*Yangle Liu,Fengze Li,Kan Liu,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endo-G²T is a geometry-guided training scheme for 4D Gaussian splatting that addresses view-dependent effects in endoscopic videos by using monocular depth priors, temporal consistency modeling, and keyframe-constrained streaming for efficient dynamic scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic videos suffer from strong view-dependent effects like specularities and reflections that cause geometric drift in photometric supervision, leading to erroneous shapes that become hard to correct during densification.

Method: Three main components: 1) Geo-guided prior distillation using confidence-gated monocular depth with warm-up-to-cap schedule, 2) Time-embedded Gaussian field with rotor-like rotation for temporal coherence, 3) Keyframe-constrained streaming with max-points budget for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets among monocular reconstruction baselines, demonstrating improved geometric accuracy and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme effectively anchors geometry early in 4D Gaussian splatting while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: STVG-o1 enables off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art spatio-temporal video grounding performance without architectural changes, using bounding-box chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-dimensional reinforcement rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders.

Method: Introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism for explicit spatio-temporal reasoning and designs a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function with format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards for geometry-aware supervision.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming best task-specific method by 7.3% m_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matches specialized models on VidSTG, and surpasses all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins with strong open-vocabulary generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal video grounding, demonstrating that off-the-shelf models can achieve top performance with appropriate reasoning mechanisms and reinforcement fine-tuning.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning methods lack human-like abstract visual thinking due to limited flexibility from external tools, creating a need for direct latent visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-stage distillation-based SFT pipeline to address computational cost and supervision issues, plus VLPO reinforcement learning that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates.

Result: Monet-7B shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks with strong out-of-distribution generalization on abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables direct latent visual reasoning in MLLMs, with empirical analysis providing insights for future developments in this area.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiverseVAR enhances diversity in text-conditioned visual autoregressive models without retraining by combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel latent refinement to improve diversity while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from limited diversity, producing nearly identical images for simple prompts, which has been overlooked due to focus on image quality.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Inject noise into text embeddings to increase diversity, 2) Use scale-travel latent refinement with multi-scale autoencoder to resume generation at intermediate stages and preserve image quality.

Result: Combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR provides an effective test-time solution to improve VAR model diversity without computational overhead or retraining, addressing a critical limitation in current visual autoregressive models.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel remote sensing change captioning method that uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment in remote sensing change captioning, which aims to describe changes between two images in natural language.

Method: The method uses CNN/Transformer for global features, SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, a knowledge graph for object information, cross-attention fusion, and Transformer decoder for caption generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses region awareness and temporal alignment issues in remote sensing change captioning by leveraging SAM foundation model and knowledge graph integration.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-M3RF is an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that combines geometric and color features using SE(3) flow matching to address limitations of geometry-only approaches, achieving significant error reduction on cultural heritage datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based 3D reassembly methods primarily rely on geometric features, which struggle with ambiguous cases like small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. They also lack physical constraints to prevent overlapping assemblies.

Method: Uses SE(3) flow matching with multimodal features: rotation-equivariant encoder for 3D point positions and transformer for color features at each point, then combines both feature sets.

Result: On the RePAIR dataset, reduces rotation error by 23.1%, translation error by 13.2%, and Chamfer Distance by 18.4% compared to competing methods. Validated on four datasets including synthetic and cultural heritage datasets.

Conclusion: E-M3RF effectively addresses limitations of geometry-only approaches by incorporating multimodal features and physical constraints, demonstrating superior performance particularly on challenging cultural heritage reassembly tasks.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce spatially sparse but temporally dense event streams, and existing representation learning methods struggle with undersampling caused by spatial sparsity.

Method: Uses hypergraphs to connect event tokens across different times and spatial locations, leverages contextual information message passing to complete sparse events, and can incorporate RGB tokens for multi-modal completion. Aggregates hypergraph node information across time steps via self-attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-based approach effectively addresses spatial sparsity in event streams and enables successful multi-modal feature learning and fusion.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers suffer from quadratic computational complexity, and existing token reduction methods overlook frequency characteristics like rank collapsing and over-smoothing in self-attention.

Method: Partition tokens into high-frequency and low-frequency tokens, selectively preserve high-frequency tokens, and aggregate low-frequency tokens into a compact DC token to retain essential low-frequency components.

Result: The approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over-smoothing.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-aware token reduction strategy effectively addresses computational efficiency issues in Vision Transformers while preserving performance through better handling of frequency characteristics.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

*Taehoon Kim,Donghwan Jang,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Merge-and-Bound (M&B) is a novel training approach for Class Incremental Learning that manipulates model weights through inter-task and intra-task merging, with bounded updates to minimize catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning by directly optimizing model weights in parameter space without requiring architectural changes or revised learning objectives.

Method: Uses two weight merging techniques: inter-task merging (averaging weights from previous stages) and intra-task merging (combining parameters within current stage), plus bounded update optimization to minimize cumulative updates while preserving previous knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard CIL benchmarks.

Conclusion: M&B effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning through parameter-space manipulation and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD) uses cross-attention mechanisms for feature-based knowledge distillation, enabling dynamic pixel-wise knowledge transfer between teacher and student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-attention distillation methods align teacher and student features independently, lacking comprehensive pixel-wise relationship modeling. CanKD aims to enable more thorough knowledge transfer by considering all pixel interactions between teacher and student feature maps.

Method: Introduces cross-attention mechanism where each pixel in student feature map dynamically attends to all pixels in teacher feature map. Uses additional loss function for non-local knowledge transfer without complex architectural changes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods on object detection and image segmentation tasks. Demonstrates superior performance compared to existing attention-guided distillation approaches.

Conclusion: CanKD presents a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision, effectively capturing pixel-wise relationships through cross-attention mechanisms for improved feature representation learning.

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

TL;DR: Systematic investigation of design choices in deepfake detection reveals that implementation details often matter more than core architecture, leading to robust best practices for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection effectiveness depends heavily on implementation details rather than core design, making fair comparisons difficult and obscuring true performance factors.

Method: Systematic investigation of how different design choices influence accuracy and generalization, focusing on training, inference, and incremental updates while isolating individual factors.

Result: Identified a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Established robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for future deepfake detection systems by isolating the impact of individual design factors.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems.

*Yiyang Jiang,Guangwu Qian,Jiaxin Wu,Qi Huang,Qing Li,Yongkang Wu,Xiao-Yong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for automated ANA detection using multi-instance multi-label learning with three key components: instance sampler, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ANA testing for autoimmune disorders is slow, labor-intensive, and requires extensive training. The complexity arises from over 100 antibody types creating diverse fluorescent patterns, and existing automated methods struggle with multi-instance multi-label challenges in clinical settings.

Method: Proposed framework with three components: instance sampler that suppresses low-confidence instances, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher for adaptive label assignment based on instance distinguishability, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients that adjust training based on empirical observations.

Result: Achieved up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains on ANA dataset over previous methods, and top-2 performance on three public medical MIML benchmarks with up to 18.2% reduction in Hamming loss and 26.9% reduction in one-error.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles MIML complexities in ANA detection, supports end-to-end optimization, and sets new state-of-the-art results while working with unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

*Pierre Adorni,Minh-Tan Pham,Stéphane May,Sébastien Lefèvre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for Remote Sensing Foundation Models that decomposes training into lightweight task-specific specialists, offering efficiency and sustainability advantages over large monolithic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation model approaches require prohibitive computational resources and create environmental concerns, limiting accessibility and conflicting with sustainable AI principles.

Method: Decomposes training into lightweight ConvNeXtV2 specialists that are task-specific, can be frozen and reused, and supports federated training, pruning, and continuous integration.

Result: Creates a modular framework that is more efficient, interpretable, and extensible than traditional large-scale foundation models.

Conclusion: The Ensemble-of-Specialists framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient Remote Sensing Foundation Models, particularly suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

TL;DR: A novel method for generating sequential MRI images with quantitative metrics and age-scaling to predict Alzheimer's disease progression, achieving high similarity in synthesized images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely identification of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for personalized treatment, but existing methods struggle with irregular time intervals and accurate disease representation in generated images.

Method: Sequential image generation guided by quantitative metrics with age-scaling factor to produce age-specific MRI images for disease progression prediction.

Result: Quantitative metrics significantly improved MRI synthesis accuracy, age-scaled pixel loss enhanced iterative generation, and achieved Structural Similarity Index of 0.882 for long-term prognosis.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively generates realistic MRI sequences for Alzheimer's disease prediction, with quantitative guidance and age-scaling improving synthesis quality and disease progression modeling.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRFL enables efficient preference optimization for video generation by conducting reward feedback learning entirely in latent space, avoiding expensive VAE decoding and improving motion dynamics and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reward models require pixel-space inputs after VAE decoding, which is computationally expensive, memory-intensive, and only optimizes late-stage visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics.

Method: Propose Process Reward Feedback Learning (PRFL) that uses pre-trained video generation models as reward models in noisy latent space, enabling gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding.

Result: PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: Video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in latent space, enabling more efficient and effective preference optimization that improves both visual quality and motion dynamics.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAVLight is a new benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction that captures scenes at multiple fixed times of day along repeatable flight paths, enabling controlled study of lighting variation under consistent geometry and viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination inconsistency is a major challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction, especially in UAV-based scenarios where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. Existing datasets either lack meaningful illumination diversity or have confounding geometric/semantic changes.

Method: The benchmark captures each scene along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation while maintaining consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.

Result: UAVLight provides a controlled-yet-real benchmark that enables standardized evaluation of reconstruction methods across different lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking 3D reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for 3D point cloud models suffer from high computational overhead and poor generalization across different attack types, limiting their practical deployment in security-sensitive applications.

Method: Proposes Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) that aligns student point cloud features with robust embeddings from three teachers: vision model (depth projections), high-performance 3D model, and text encoder, using confidence-gated mechanism to balance modality contributions.

Result: MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against various white-box and black-box attacks, while achieving better performance on clean data without additional inference cost.

Conclusion: The work presents a practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge through distillation during training only.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

TL;DR: A framework combining 2D/3D landmark registration with U-Net training improves pelvic landmark detection accuracy under variable patient positioning in fluoroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pelvic landmark detection methods assume fixed Antero-Posterior views, but real intra-operative imaging often has variable orientations due to patient repositioning or imaging unit movement.

Method: Proposed framework incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into U-Net training, comparing baseline U-Net, U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss.

Result: The method addresses variable patient pose conditions in realistic intra-operative settings.

Conclusion: Integrating pose estimation with landmark detection improves robustness to orientation variations in pelvic fluoroscopy.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

TL;DR: Harmony introduces a novel framework that addresses audio-visual synchronization challenges in joint diffusion models through cross-task synergy training, global-local decoupled interaction, and synchronization-enhanced CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source models struggle with robust audio-video alignment due to three fundamental challenges in joint diffusion: correspondence drift, inefficient global attention, and intra-modal bias of CFG.

Method: Proposes Cross-Task Synergy training to mitigate drift, Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for temporal-style alignment, and Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) to amplify alignment signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show Harmony establishes new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in generation fidelity and fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: Harmony successfully overcomes fundamental synchronization challenges in joint audio-visual generation through mechanistic enforcement of alignment, achieving superior performance in both fidelity and synchronization.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise as a first step toward trustworthy computer-aided diagnostic systems for early oral cancer detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN is a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism in video diffusion models without needing reward models or human preference data, using an optical-flow discriminator and distribution-matching regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard video diffusion models achieve good frame-level fidelity but struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics due to the denoising MSE objective lacking direct temporal consistency supervision.

Method: Built on a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, MoGAN trains a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity.

Result: MoGAN substantially improves motion quality: +7.3% on VBench and +7.4% on VideoJAM-Bench over the teacher model, +13.3% and +8.8% over DMD respectively, while maintaining comparable aesthetic and image-quality scores. Human studies confirm preference for MoGAN's motion quality.

Conclusion: MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

*M. Naseer Subhani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-prompting framework that adapts SAM to remote sensing imagery using only sparse point annotations, achieving better performance than pretrained SAM and other point-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM performs poorly on remote sensing imagery due to domain shift and lack of dense annotations, while dense annotations are expensive to obtain.

Method: Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop: generate coarse masks from points, improve with self-constructed box prompts, and align embeddings across iterations to reduce bias.

Result: Consistently outperforms pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised methods on WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: Self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path for adapting foundation segmentation models to remote sensing with minimal annotation cost.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

TL;DR: Proposes a label-efficient GCN model for skeleton-based action recognition using adversarial exemplar selection and bidirectional stable GCN architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of GCNs requiring large labeled datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, which are often scarce in practical applications.

Method: 1) Novel adversarial acquisition function to select informative exemplars balancing representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty; 2) Bidirectional and stable GCN architectures for better mapping between ambient and latent spaces.

Result: Extensive evaluations on two challenging benchmarks show significant improvements over prior work in label-efficient skeleton-based action recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed label-efficient GCN model effectively addresses data scarcity in skeleton-based action recognition through strategic exemplar selection and enhanced network architectures.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

TL;DR: Qwen3-VL is the most advanced vision-language model in the Qwen series, featuring native support for 256K token interleaved contexts, multiple model sizes (2B-235B), and superior performance across multimodal benchmarks including text understanding, long-context comprehension, and multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive vision-language model that can handle diverse multimodal tasks with superior performance, supporting both dense and mixture-of-experts architectures to accommodate different latency-quality trade-offs.

Method: Three key architectural upgrades: enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for spatial-temporal modeling, DeepStack integration for multi-level ViT features to improve vision-language alignment, and text-based time alignment for video (evolving from T-RoPE to explicit timestamp alignment).

Result: Achieves superior performance across comprehensive evaluations including MMMU, MathVista, and MathVision benchmarks, with strong pure-text understanding, robust long-context comprehension (256K tokens), and advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks.

Conclusion: Qwen3-VL serves as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows, delivering leading performance under comparable token budgets and latency constraints.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

TL;DR: A system for efficient AI error correction on devices using few-shot learning with server-side foundation model training and on-device prototype-based classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address AI prediction errors on resource-constrained devices where existing solutions focus on detection but lack efficient correction mechanisms.

Method: Combines server-side foundation model training via knowledge distillation with on-device prototype-based classification that enables error correction through prototype updates instead of model retraining.

Result: Achieved over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets with minimal forgetting (<0.02%) and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: The system proves practical for real-world deployment, enabling efficient AI error correction on resource-constrained devices through the proposed prototype-based approach.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFlow is a unified framework for long-term Action Quality Assessment that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow to address challenges in modeling extended temporal dynamics while being robust to contextual confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term AQA is challenging due to the need to model extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either require costly annotations or use unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations.

Method: Proposes CaFlow with two key modules: Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) for self-supervised disentanglement of causal and confounding features, and BiT-Flow for bidirectional temporal modeling with cycle-consistency constraints to produce smoother representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CaFlow effectively addresses the challenges of long-term AQA by combining causal robustness through counterfactual interventions with bidirectional temporal modeling, providing a unified solution for fine-grained execution score prediction in extended action sequences.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

TL;DR: Multi-Crit benchmark evaluates multimodal models' ability to follow diverse evaluation criteria, revealing limitations in both proprietary and open-source models for pluralistic judgment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capability of large multimodal models to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria in multimodal evaluation systems.

Method: Developed Multi-Crit benchmark through rigorous data curation pipeline with challenging response pairs and multi-criterion human annotations, introducing three novel metrics for systematic assessment.

Result: Analysis of 25 LMMs shows proprietary models struggle with pluralistic criteria adherence, open-source models lag further behind, and critic fine-tuning enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic judgment.

Conclusion: Multi-Crit establishes foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation, highlighting current limitations in multimodal judges' criterion-level judgment capabilities.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

TL;DR: ADVLA is an efficient adversarial attack framework for Vision-Language-Action models that applies perturbations directly in feature space, achieving high attack success with minimal visible changes and low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for VLA models require costly end-to-end training and generate noticeable perturbation patches, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: ADVLA applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from visual encoder to textual feature space, using attention guidance to make perturbations focused and sparse. It employs three strategies: sensitivity enhancement, sparsity enforcement, and perturbation concentration.

Result: Under L∞=4/255 constraint, ADVLA with Top-K masking modifies <10% of patches while achieving ~100% attack success rate. Perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, nearly imperceptible, with single-step iteration taking ~0.06 seconds.

Conclusion: ADVLA effectively weakens VLA model action predictions under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional methods, demonstrating unique effectiveness for attacking VLA feature spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining U-Net segmentation with DenseNet-VGG classification using multihead attention achieves 98% Dice coefficient for tumor segmentation and 99% accuracy for glioma classification in 3D MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gliomas have high mortality rates, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial for effective therapeutic intervention and treatment planning.

Method: Hybrid framework with U-Net for tumor segmentation and DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention mechanisms, using preprocessing (normalization, resampling, data augmentation) for 3D MRI data.

Result: Achieved 98% Dice coefficient for tumor segmentation and 99% classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods.

Conclusion: The framework shows great potential for timely and reliable glioma diagnosis and grading, enhancing clinical decision-making and treatment planning through improved interpretability and accuracy.

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Camera trajectories alone can reveal video content through contrastive learning with natural language, showing that 'how you move' reveals 'what you are doing or observing'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether camera trajectories (movement paths) alone can reveal video content without seeing actual pixels, challenging the conventional belief that visual content is necessary

Method: Proposed CamFormer - a contrastive learning framework that projects camera pose trajectories into joint embedding space aligned with natural language

Result: Camera trajectories are surprisingly informative for uncovering video content; learned embeddings work well for cross-modal alignment, classification, and temporal analysis across different pose estimation methods

Conclusion: Camera trajectory is established as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern diffusion models struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control when users simultaneously specify multiple constraints like text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations.

Method: Encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret, and use Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy with curated multi-task datasets to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls in a unified learning paradigm.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image enables faithful reflection of user intent through integrated visual-spatial reasoning across multiple control modalities, generalizing well to multi-control scenarios during inference.

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

*Saurabhchand Bhati,Samuel Thomas,Hilde Kuehne,Rogerio Feris,James Glass*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to compress audio tokens in Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) to address scalability issues caused by quadratic attention complexity and high audio token rates, enabling deployment on resource-constrained platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LALMs face scalability limitations due to quadratic attention complexity and high audio token rates, making it difficult to extend them to long-form audio and deploy on edge devices.

Method: The authors use unsupervised segmentation and uniform average pooling to reduce audio tokens before the LLM decoder, and employ low-rank adapters to mitigate performance degradation from compressed representations.

Result: Compressed LALMs achieve performance close to frame-level LALMs while reducing input audio token count up to three times before the LLM backbone, as demonstrated in ASR and speech-to-speech translation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed compression techniques effectively address LALM scalability issues while maintaining competitive performance, making long-form audio processing and edge deployment more feasible.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.
  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.

TL;DR: RosettaSpeech is a zero-shot speech-to-speech translation framework that uses monolingual speech-text data with machine translation supervision, eliminating the need for parallel speech pairs and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of parallel speech corpora hampers speech-to-speech translation, forcing reliance on complex multi-stage pipelines. The paper aims to create a simplified framework that doesn't require parallel speech-to-speech pairs.

Method: Uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as direct end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. Trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision, leveraging linguistic knowledge from text-based NMT models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English on CVSS-C test set, with relative gains of over 27% and 14% respectively. Single model delivers strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN).

Conclusion: By relying on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving speech-to-speech translation for broader language coverage.

Abstract: The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI chatbots represent diverse cultures, particularly Indian cultural identities, as millions use them for creative needs, with cultural evaluation in open-ended tasks being challenging and underexplored.

Method: Developed TALES-Tax taxonomy through focus groups (N=9) and surveys (N=15), then evaluated 6 models through large-scale annotation study (2,925 annotations from 108 annotators across 71 Indian regions and 14 languages).

Result: 88% of generated stories contain cultural inaccuracies; errors more prevalent in mid/low-resourced languages and peri-urban regions; models possess requisite cultural knowledge despite generating misrepresentations.

Conclusion: Created TALES-QA evaluation benchmark; discovered models have cultural knowledge but still generate misrepresentations, highlighting need for better cultural representation in AI systems.

Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models.

Abstract: While text entry is an essential and frequent task in Augmented Reality (AR) applications, devising an efficient and easy-to-use text entry method for AR remains an open challenge. This research presents STAR, a smartphone-analogous AR text entry technique that leverages a user's familiarity with smartphone two-thumb typing. With STAR, a user performs thumb typing on a virtual QWERTY keyboard that is overlain on the skin of their hands. During an evaluation study of STAR, participants achieved a mean typing speed of 21.9 WPM (i.e., 56% of their smartphone typing speed), and a mean error rate of 0.3% after 30 minutes of practice. We further analyze the major factors implicated in the performance gap between STAR and smartphone typing, and discuss ways this gap could be narrowed.

*Yicheng Zhong,Peiji Yang,Zhisheng Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes multi-reward GRPO framework to optimize single-codebook TTS LLMs, addressing prosody instability and speaker drift issues through reinforcement learning with intelligibility, speaker similarity, and rule-based rewards including LLM-annotated prosody alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-codebook TTS LLMs are efficient but suffer from unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness, requiring better optimization methods.

Method: Multi-reward GRPO framework with intelligibility, speaker similarity, and three rule-based rewards (length penalty, entropy regularization, LLM-annotated prosody alignment using external reasoning LLM for pause structures). Also tested with flow-matching decoder on optimized backbone.

Result: Consistent improvements in prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and overall speech naturalness across different data sizes and model scales. Flow-matching decoder further enhances performance.

Conclusion: The proposed GRPO framework effectively optimizes single-codebook TTS LLMs, improving their prosodic quality and naturalness while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, inspiring autoregressive frameworks that represent speech as sequences of discrete codec tokens. Among them, single-codebook TTS LLMs have emerged as compact and streamable architectures that jointly model semantic and acoustic integration. However, despite their efficiency, these models often exhibit unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness. To address these issues, we propose a multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that directly optimizes the token generation policy of single-codebook TTS LLMs. Beyond standard intelligibility and speaker similarity objectives, our design integrates three rule-based rewards: a length penalty for duration consistency, an entropy regularization reward for decoding stability, and an LLM-annotated prosody alignment reward that explicitly supervises rhythm. In this prosody reward, an external reasoning LLM predicts multiple plausible pause structures via in-context learning, providing a human-preference-aligned supervisory signal for GRPO training. To assess universality, we further attach a flow-matching (FM) decoder on top of the GRPO-optimized AR backbone and observe consistent additional gains, indicating that our reinforcement optimization enhances the intrinsic AR policy. We further conduct a scalability analysis across data sizes and model scales, revealing that the proposed method consistently enhances prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and overall speech naturalness in single-codebook TTS LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a definitive origin for Zipf's law in language, which has been debated across fields, by demonstrating it can arise from purely geometric mechanisms rather than linguistic or communicative factors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ST-PPO and S-PPO, two stabilized variants of PPO that address instability in multi-turn LLM training through turn-level importance sampling and clipping-bias correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO is unstable for token-level training in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks, suffering from misaligned importance sampling and inaccurate advantage estimates that cause performance collapse.

Method: Two stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling that aligns with multi-turn structure, and (2) clipping-bias correction that normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable off-policy samples. Three variants: Turn-PPO, S-PPO, and ST-PPO.

Result: ST-PPO and S-PPO prevent performance collapses in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO across multi-turn search tasks in QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

*Liangzu Peng,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Luca Zancato,Elvis Nunez,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated KalmaNet (GKA) is an efficient linear state-space model layer that solves online ridge regression to account for the full past while maintaining constant memory and linear compute, addressing numerical stability and hardware efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear state-space models maintain only lossy, fading summaries of the past, leading to inferior performance in recall-oriented tasks, creating a need for methods that can efficiently utilize the full context.

Method: GKA solves online ridge regression using Kalman Filter inspiration with two key innovations: adaptive regularization with input-dependent gating for numerical stability, and Chebyshev Iteration for stable low-precision computation, plus hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation.

Result: GKA outperforms existing SSM layers on short-context tasks and achieves over 10% relative improvement on long-context RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens compared to fading memory baselines.

Conclusion: GKA successfully bridges the performance gap between efficient SSMs and full-context models while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating strong capabilities in both short and long-context language understanding tasks.

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework for offline data selection and online self-refining generation in LLM fine-tuning, using bilevel optimization to assign learned weights to data samples for improved adaptation to downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance data quality for LLM fine-tuning through systematic offline data selection and online self-refining generation, addressing the challenge of adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks effectively.

Method: Uses bilevel data selection for offline filtering with respect to validation data, and treats online self-refining generation as model adaptation by selecting responses that best fit validation data. Assigns learned data weights to questions and responses.

Result: Theoretically demonstrates effectiveness of bilevel data selection framework and shows performance gains over unfiltered baselines. Enhances fine-tuning performance by combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves LLM fine-tuning for quality enhancement and safety-aware applications by unifying offline data selection and online self-refining generation through learned data weighting.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators but their judgments are noisy, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Existing bias-correction methods are underutilized and assume exact knowledge of specificity/sensitivity.

Method: A plug-in framework that corrects bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration datasets, plus an adaptive algorithm for efficient calibration sample allocation.

Result: Enables practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation by properly accounting for uncertainty in specificity and sensitivity estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a solution for reducing bias and properly quantifying uncertainty in LLM-based evaluation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Result: Achieved 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Advances state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

TL;DR: SDT and STT architectures use Bayesian surprise to dynamically route computation in Transformers, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache by 50% through conditional computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have rigid, uniform computation allocation that limits efficiency and scalability for large models and long sequences.

Method: SDT uses alternating Decision layers (computing posterior/prior) and Dynamic layers (Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise). STT extends to temporal domain with transition networks predicting residual updates and routers dynamically executing/bypassing TF blocks.

Result: Both architectures show shift from novelty to prediction-driven gating during training, achieving 75% reduction in self-attention computation and 50% reduction in KV-cache requirements.

Conclusion: The architectures provide a flexible framework for efficient conditional computation, offering insights into compute-accuracy trade-offs and setting a pathway for more efficient models.

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

Result: CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor (maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models) and provides competitively efficient calibrated set predictions with interpretable hierarchical explanations of coherent sets.

Conclusion: CHiQPM demonstrates that interpretability can be incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy, offering uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability that paves the way for effective human-AI collaboration in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

TL;DR: An autoregressive conditional GAN model for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction that outperforms conventional deep learning methods in accuracy and boundary delineation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change has intensified wildfires, but existing physics-based simulators are too slow for real-time use, while deep learning models produce overly smooth predictions that miss complex wildfire dynamics.

Method: Autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) that learns sequential state transitions for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction.

Result: The CGAN model outperforms conventional deep learning models in predictive accuracy and fire perimeter boundary delineation, capturing nonlinear dynamics and uncertainty better than pixel-average fitting approaches.

Conclusion: The autoregressive CGAN framework enhances both accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, providing a promising tool for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deeper Vision Transformers perform worse than shallower ones due to a Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern in representation evolution, where better performance comes from marginalizing the [CLS] token in favor of distributed patch token consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deeper Vision Transformers often underperform shallower ones, challenging common scaling assumptions in transformer architectures.

Method: Systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, using an Information Scrambling Index to quantify information mixing patterns across layers.

Result: Identified consistent three-phase pattern; better performance correlates with [CLS] token marginalization and distributed patch token consensus; ViT-L shows delayed information-task tradeoff with increased information diffusion rather than improved performance.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures benefit more from carefully calibrated depth with clean phase transitions than simply increasing parameters; Information Scrambling Index serves as useful diagnostic for model design.

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

TL;DR: A three-stage ViT-based segmentation framework for Hirschsprung Disease diagnosis that sequentially segments muscularis propria, myenteric plexus, and ganglion cells with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung Disease, which is characterized by their absence.

Method: Three-stage segmentation using Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) with resolution-specific tiling and tailored postprocessing, mimicking pathologist's diagnostic approach on 30 whole-slide images with expert annotations.

Result: Muscularis segmentation: 89.9% Dice, 100% Plexus Inclusion; Plexus segmentation: 94.8% recall, 84.2% precision; Ganglion cells: 62.1% precision/89.1% recall (high certainty), 67.0% precision (joint certainty).

Conclusion: ViT-based models effectively leverage global tissue context and capture cellular morphology, showing great potential to support digital pathology workflows and reduce inter-observer variability in Hirschsprung Disease evaluation.

Abstract: Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.

### [183] [ENACT: Evaluating Embodied Cognition with World Modeling of Egocentric Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20937)
*Qineng Wang,Wenlong Huang,Yu Zhou,Hang Yin,Tianwei Bao,Jianwen Lyu,Weiyu Liu,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei,Manling Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ENACT is a benchmark that evaluates embodied cognition in vision-language models through world modeling tasks using egocentric interaction in VQA format, revealing performance gaps between models and humans that increase with interaction complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether modern vision-language models exhibit signs of embodied cognition despite being trained in disembodied ways, by creating a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: Created ENACT benchmark with forward world modeling (reordering observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reordering actions given observations) tasks, using a POMDP framework with scene graph changes as actions, synthesized from robotics simulation data.

Result: Frontier VLMs show significant performance gaps compared to humans, especially with longer interaction horizons. Models perform better on inverse tasks than forward ones and exhibit anthropocentric biases like right-handed action preference and sensitivity to camera viewpoint deviations.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack robust embodied cognition capabilities, with performance degrading as interaction complexity increases, suggesting the need for more embodied training approaches to achieve human-like world understanding.

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

### [184] [Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21398)
*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web introduces programmatic DOM pruning using LLM-generated Python scripts to efficiently handle large web page structures, achieving 25-50x reduction in elements and improving grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based web agents struggle with large DOM structures (10k-100k tokens) that require crude truncation or inefficient heuristics, risking information loss and poor precision-scalability balance.

Method: DOM Tree Pruning Programming where LLMs generate executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from sub-tasks, avoiding direct LLM processing of raw DOMs.

Result: Achieves 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding and dramatically improves low-level grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28% in experiments.

Conclusion: Prune4Web provides an effective paradigm shift from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning, enabling precise web automation while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

### [185] [Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20934)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations of neural networks, addressing limitations of beam search methods that lack theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compositional explanation methods use beam search which cannot provide theoretical guarantees of optimality, making it unclear how close explanations are to the true optimum.

Method: Proposed framework includes: (i) decomposition identifying factors influencing spatial alignment, (ii) heuristic to estimate alignment during search, and (iii) first algorithm for computing optimal explanations within feasible time.

Result: Analysis shows 10-40% of beam search explanations are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. A beam-search variant using the proposed decomposition and heuristic matches or improves runtime while offering greater flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework enables computation of guaranteed optimal compositional explanations, revealing significant suboptimality in current methods and providing more efficient alternatives.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

*Chujie Wang,Jianyu Lu,Zhiyuan Luo,Xi Chen,Chu He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection using a Visual Chain-of-Thought approach modeled as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection methods create a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference, with textual space being underexplored despite its potential to significantly enhance OVOD performance.

Method: Proposes OVOD-Agent with Visual-CoT using explicit actions, models visual context transitions as w-MDP over eight state spaces, includes Bandit module for exploration signals, and integrates Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model optimization.

Result: Experiments on COCO and LVIS show consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between training and inference in OVOD through proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: PA-EWC is a novel continual learning method that reduces catastrophic forgetting in medical AI systems by using prompt-guided parameter specialization across diverse imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, needing to learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities, especially challenging for vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments.

Method: Prompt-Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC) categorizes model parameters based on functional roles (visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, medical-semantic), uses adaptive Fisher Information with gradient stability analysis, and weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density.

Result: PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baselines, with 4.30% improvement on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation across five medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed PA-EWC method effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in medical vision-language models through prompt-guided parameter specialization, enabling better adaptation to new clinical requirements while preserving critical diagnostic knowledge.

Abstract: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, where models must learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities. This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound. Experimental results demonstrate that PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baseline methods, with performance improvements of 4.30% on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation.

*Xinyue Guo,Xiaoran Yang,Lipan Zhang,Jianxuan Yang,Zhao Wang,Jian Luan*

TL;DR: AV-Edit is a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained audio editing in videos by leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics through multimodal pre-training and diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sound effect editing approaches rely on low-level signal processing or coarse text prompts, resulting in limited flexibility and suboptimal audio quality.

Method: Uses contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, then trains an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with correlation-based feature gating to remove irrelevant sounds and generate missing audio elements.

Result: Generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in sound effect editing and strong competitiveness in audio generation.

Conclusion: AV-Edit effectively addresses limitations of existing sound editing methods by leveraging multimodal semantics, demonstrating superior performance in generating contextually appropriate audio modifications.

Abstract: Sound effect editing-modifying audio by adding, removing, or replacing elements-remains constrained by existing approaches that rely solely on low-level signal processing or coarse text prompts, often resulting in limited flexibility and suboptimal audio quality. To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations. These representations are then used to train an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) capable of removing visually irrelevant sounds and generating missing audio elements consistent with video content through a correlation-based feature gating training strategy. Furthermore, we construct a dedicated video-based sound editing dataset as an evaluation benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AV-Edit generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of sound effect editing and exhibiting strong competitiveness in the domain of audio generation.

TL;DR: Proposes a variational method using fractional derivatives in frequency domain for Raman spectrum denoising, balancing noise removal with feature preservation through Shannon entropy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses interference of fluorescence signals and noise in Raman spectrum analysis that obscures subtle spectral features critical for accurate analysis.

Method: Minimizes functional involving fractional derivatives, reformulates in frequency domain via Fourier transform, optimizes regularization parameter and derivative order using Shannon entropy.

Result: Produces efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter that effectively removes noise while preserving essential chemical features like peak position, intensity, and area.

Conclusion: The combination of variational approach in frequency domain, fractional derivatives, and Shannon entropy optimization creates an effective filter for Raman spectrum denoising and image processing.

Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.

TL;DR: MTI-Net is an end-to-end multi-task framework for simultaneous liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification using multi-domain information fusion and task interaction modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No prior work has achieved liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, lacking effective inter-task relevance capture and dynamic MRI information extraction mechanisms.

Method: Proposes MTI-Net with Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF) for frequency/spectral domain integration, task interaction module for higher-order consistency, task-driven discriminator for inter-task relationships, and shallow Transformer for dynamic MRI sequence encoding.

Result: MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks on a dataset of 238 subjects, showing strong potential for clinical liver tumor assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed MTI-Net framework effectively addresses simultaneous liver tumor analysis tasks through multi-domain fusion and task interaction, offering promising clinical assistance capabilities.

Abstract: Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

*Chicago Y. Park,Michael T. McCann,Cristina Garcia-Cardona,Brendt Wohlberg,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep Parameter Interpolation (DPI) is a method that transforms neural networks to accept scalar inputs by interpolating between two parameter sets, improving performance in diffusion and flow matching models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adding scalar inputs to neural networks either encode scalars as image inputs or restrict architecture choices, limiting flexibility and performance.

Method: DPI maintains two learnable parameter sets and dynamically interpolates between them based on scalar values during training and sampling.

Result: DPI improves denoising performance and sample quality for diffusion and flow matching models while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to standard conditioning techniques.

Conclusion: DPI provides a simple, architecture-agnostic approach for adding scalar dependence to neural networks, enhancing generative model performance without architectural restrictions.

Abstract: We propose deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a general-purpose method for transforming an existing deep neural network architecture into one that accepts an additional scalar input. Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

Motivation: To address the limitations of single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk in caregiving AI systems where real harms emerge over multiple interactions.

Method: Evaluated four frontier models across 17 scenarios (68 total interactions) spanning three complexity tiers, using autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice, harmful information, and attachment engineering.

Result: All models showed significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8% crisis detection), with DeepSeek Chat v3 achieving highest overall score (75.9%), GPT-4o Mini leading compliance (88.2%), Gemini leading trauma-informed design (85.0%), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranking highest in crisis detection (44.8%).

Conclusion: Deterministic crisis routing is necessary in production systems due to significant safety gaps, and the benchmark extends safety evaluation to longitudinal risk assessment.

Abstract: InvisibleBench is a deployment gate for caregiving-relationship AI, evaluating 3-20+ turn interactions across five dimensions: Safety, Compliance, Trauma-Informed Design, Belonging/Cultural Fitness, and Memory. The benchmark includes autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice (WOPR Act), harmful information, and attachment engineering. We evaluate four frontier models across 17 scenarios (N=68) spanning three complexity tiers. All models show significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8 percent crisis detection), indicating the necessity of deterministic crisis routing in production systems. DeepSeek Chat v3 achieves the highest overall score (75.9 percent), while strengths differ by dimension: GPT-4o Mini leads Compliance (88.2 percent), Gemini leads Trauma-Informed Design (85.0 percent), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranks highest in crisis detection (44.8 percent). We release all scenarios, judge prompts, and scoring configurations with code. InvisibleBench extends single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk, where real harms emerge.

TL;DR: LLMs show widespread susceptibility to complicit facilitation of unlawful activities, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases, and existing safety measures are insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the risk of LLMs assisting unlawful activities through complicit facilitation, which remains underexplored despite large-scale deployment.

Method: Four empirical studies using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks to construct an evaluation benchmark with 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents, analyzing model reasoning traces and safety alignment strategies.

Result: Widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, deficient legal warnings and positive guidance, heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests and frequent violations, demographic disparities affecting marginalized groups, and insufficient safety alignment strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant complicit facilitation behavior with concerning socio-legal patterns, and current safety measures fail to adequately address this risk.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks. However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.

Motivation: Current RMOT research is limited to ground-level scenarios, constraining broad-scale scene understanding, while UAVs offer expansive aerial views and are emerging as critical platforms for embodied intelligence requiring natural language interaction.

Method: Developed COALA framework for semi-automated collaborative labeling, and proposed HawkEyeTrack (HETrack) method that enhances vision-language representation learning and UAV scenario perception.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of the dataset and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: AerialMind bridges the research gap in UAV-based RMOT, enabling intelligent aerial systems with natural language interaction capabilities for wide-area surveillance and tracking.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.

Result: Achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Conclusion: SocialNav effectively addresses the challenge of socially-aware navigation through its hierarchical architecture and comprehensive training approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in both navigation success and social compliance.

Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SLUE provides distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds using convex optimization to generate ellipsoidal uncertainty sets that guarantee high probability containment of true object pose.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods lack statistically rigorous uncertainty quantification without strict distributional assumptions, which is essential for robust robotics applications.

Method: Uses high probability noise bounds on 2D keypoint detections to create non-convex pose uncertainty constraints, then applies S-lemma inspired convex optimization (SLUE) to compute ellipsoidal uncertainty bounds, with extensions to sum-of-squares relaxations for tighter bounds.

Result: SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds compared to prior work, validated on pose estimation datasets and real-world drone tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: SLUE provides a principled, distribution-free approach to pose uncertainty quantification that guarantees high probability containment of true pose and can be efficiently computed without initial guess requirements.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.

TL;DR: TraceGen introduces a symbolic 3D trace-space representation that enables learning robot tasks from diverse cross-embodiment videos, achieving high success rates with minimal target demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning new robot tasks from few demonstrations by leveraging abundant videos from different embodiments (humans, robots) despite differences in embodiment, camera, and environment.

Method: Develop TraceGen world model that predicts motion in 3D trace-space instead of pixels, and create TraceForge pipeline to transform heterogeneous videos into consistent 3D traces for training.

Result: With just 5 target robot videos, achieves 80% success across 4 tasks with 50-600x faster inference than video-based world models. With 5 uncalibrated human videos, reaches 67.5% success on real robot.

Conclusion: TraceGen's symbolic 3D motion representation enables efficient cross-embodiment learning without object detectors or heavy pixel generation, demonstrating strong adaptation capabilities from minimal demonstrations.

Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.
