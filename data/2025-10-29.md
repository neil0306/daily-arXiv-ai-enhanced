### [1] [Evaluating Long-Term Memory for Long-Context Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23730)
*Alessandra Terranova,Björn Ross,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods for LLMs shows they reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy, with optimal memory architecture scaling with model capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need memory to achieve conversational continuity and experiential learning, but it's unclear which memory types are most effective for long-context conversational tasks.

Method: Used LoCoMo benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues to analyze full-context prompting, semantic memory (RAG and agentic), episodic memory (in-context learning), and procedural memory (prompt optimization).

Result: Memory-augmented approaches reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Small models benefit most from RAG, while strong reasoning models gain from episodic learning and complex agentic semantic memory.

Conclusion: Memory architecture complexity should scale with model capability. Episodic memory helps LLMs recognize the limits of their own knowledge.

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

### [2] [BitSkip: An Empirical Analysis of Quantization and Early Exit Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23766)
*Ramshankar Bhuvaneswaran,Handan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BitSkip framework reveals that simple 8-bit quantization without Hadamard transform outperforms more complex 4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced models, competing with full-precision baseline while providing superior early-exit characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore the compositional effects of extreme quantization and dynamic routing techniques in LLMs, as individual benefits are well-documented but their interactions remain poorly understood.

Method: Introduces BitSkip, a hybrid architectural framework for systematically exploring interactions between quantization and routing techniques, testing various configurations including 8-bit and 4-bit quantization with and without Hadamard transforms.

Result: BitSkip-V1 (8-bit without Hadamard) achieves perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19 for full-precision baseline, outperforming more complex 4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts. Hadamard transforms catastrophically degraded performance by over 37,000%. BitSkip-V1 shows superior early-exit with layer 18 providing 32.5% speed gain for only 4% quality loss.

Conclusion: Simple 8-bit quantization without complex enhancements can outperform more sophisticated approaches, and Hadamard transforms introduce fundamental training instability. The optimal configuration provides significant speed gains with minimal quality degradation through strategic early-exit points.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically exploring these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8-bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

### [3] [Beyond Understanding: Evaluating the Pragmatic Gap in LLMs' Cultural Processing of Figurative Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23828)
*Mena Attia,Aashiq Muhamed,Mai Alkhamissi,Thamar Solorio,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with culturally grounded figurative language, showing performance gaps between Arabic and English proverbs, and between understanding vs. pragmatic use of idioms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to process culturally nuanced language through figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and cultural context.

Method: Designed evaluation tasks for contextual understanding, pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation using Egyptian Arabic idioms, multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Evaluated 22 open- and closed-source LLMs.

Result: Consistent performance hierarchy: Arabic proverbs 4.29% lower than English proverbs, Egyptian idioms 10.28% lower than Arabic proverbs. Pragmatic use accuracy drops 14.07% relative to understanding. Models struggle with connotative meaning (max 85.58% agreement with humans).

Conclusion: Figurative language serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning - LLMs can interpret figurative meaning but face challenges in appropriate usage. Released Kinayat dataset for future research.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

### [4] [How Pragmatics Shape Articulation: A Computational Case Study in STEM ASL Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23842)
*Saki Imai,Lee Kezar,Laurel Aichler,Mert Inan,Erin Walker,Alicia Wooten,Lorna Quandt,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how sign language changes in natural dialogue vs isolated contexts, focusing on STEM vocabulary in ASL, showing dialogue signs are significantly shorter and demonstrating entrainment effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most sign language models are trained on isolated or interpreted data, missing the natural variability and adaptation that occurs in real dialogue, particularly in educational settings where novel vocabulary is used.

Method: Collected motion capture dataset of ASL STEM dialogue, compared dyadic interactive signing vs solo lecture vs interpreted articles using continuous kinematic features to analyze spatiotemporal changes and entrainment.

Result: Dialogue signs are 24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than isolated signs, with significant reductions absent in monologue contexts. Showed spatiotemporal changes across repeated STEM term mentions and entrainment patterns.

Conclusion: The study bridges linguistic analysis and computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and its representation in sign language technologies, highlighting the importance of natural dialogue data.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

### [5] [CRADLE Bench: A Clinician-Annotated Benchmark for Multi-Faceted Mental Health Crisis and Safety Risk Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23845)
*Grace Byun,Rebecca Lipschutz,Sean T. Minton,Abigail Lott,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRADLE BENCH is a comprehensive benchmark for detecting mental health crises in language model interactions, covering 7 crisis types with temporal labels and clinician-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models struggle to reliably detect mental health crisis situations like suicide ideation, domestic violence, and sexual harassment, which can have serious consequences if missed during user interactions.

Method: Created a benchmark with 600 clinician-annotated evaluation examples, 420 development examples, and ~4K training examples automatically labeled using majority-vote ensemble of multiple language models. Fine-tuned six crisis detection models on subsets with different agreement criteria.

Result: The majority-vote ensemble approach for automatic labeling significantly outperforms single-model annotation. The benchmark provides the first multi-faceted crisis detection evaluation with temporal labels.

Conclusion: CRADLE BENCH addresses a critical gap in mental health crisis detection for language models and provides a comprehensive evaluation framework with improved annotation methods.

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

### [6] [Temporal Blindness in Multi-Turn LLM Agents: Misaligned Tool Use vs. Human Time Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23853)
*Yize Cheng,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Chenrui Fan,Kazem Faghih,Parsa Hosseini,Wenxiao Wang,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM agents suffer from temporal blindness in multi-turn conversations, failing to account for real-world time between messages. This causes them to either over-rely or under-rely on previous context when deciding tool calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical limitation of temporal blindness in LLM agents, which prevents them from properly deciding when to invoke tools based on elapsed time since last observations.

Method: Introduced TicToc-v1 test set with 34 time-sensitive scenarios, augmented dialogue with timestamps, and collected human preferences for tool-calling decisions. Evaluated LLM alignment with human preferences under varying time intervals.

Result: Without time information, models performed only slightly better than random (top alignment ~60%). Adding timestamps provided modest improvement (peaking at ~65%), and prompt-based alignment had limited effectiveness.

Conclusion: Specific post-training alignment is needed to align multi-turn LLM tool use with human temporal perception, as current methods show limited temporal awareness.

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn
conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic
environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by
default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the
real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability
when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has
passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often
either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or
under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,
we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across
34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user
question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed
since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue
messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and
evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,
creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous
observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call
(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with
human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show
that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than
random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding
timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the
improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,
prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the
need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with
human temporal perception.

### [7] [Can LLMs Narrate Tabular Data? An Evaluation Framework for Natural Language Representations of Text-to-SQL System Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23854)
*Jyotika Singh,Weiyi Sun,Amit Agarwal,Viji Krishnamurthy,Yassine Benajiba,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Combo-Eval is a novel evaluation method for LLM-generated natural language representations (NLRs) of database results that combines multiple evaluation approaches, reduces LLM calls by 25-61%, and shows superior alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based NLR generation for Text-to-SQL systems suffers from unexplored information loss and errors when converting tabular database results to natural language, requiring better evaluation methods.

Method: Developed Combo-Eval, a hybrid evaluation approach that combines benefits of multiple existing methods, and created NLR-BIRD - the first dedicated dataset for NLR benchmarking.

Result: Combo-Eval achieved 25-61% reduction in LLM calls while demonstrating superior alignment with human judgments across scenarios with and without ground truth references.

Conclusion: Combo-Eval provides an optimized, efficient evaluation framework for LLM-generated natural language representations that better aligns with human judgment and reduces computational costs.

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

### [8] [OraPlan-SQL: A Planning-Centric Framework for Complex Bilingual NL2SQL Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23870)
*Marianne Menglin Liu,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Syed Fahad Allam Shah,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OraPlan-SQL is a bilingual NL2SQL system that won the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge 2025, achieving 55.0% EX in English and 56.7% EX in Chinese with over 99% SQL validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complex reasoning requirements in NL2SQL tasks including arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical inference across bilingual scenarios, while overcoming limitations of prior multi-agent approaches with orchestration overhead.

Method: Uses an agentic framework with Planner and SQL agents, feedback-guided meta-prompting to refine the planner, entity-linking for multilingual handling, and plan diversification with majority voting for reliability.

Result: Ranked first in the challenge, exceeding second-best by over 6% in execution accuracy (55.0% English, 56.7% Chinese) while maintaining >99% SQL validity.

Conclusion: The proposed feedback-guided meta-prompting and plan diversification approach effectively handles complex bilingual NL2SQL tasks while maintaining high reliability and SQL validity.

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

Method: Integrates patient history and context within the language model space using a lightweight framework that works with frozen LLMs, applied specifically to neuropsychological assessments.

Result: Achieves accurate and reliable performance in forecasting, even when working with minimal training data.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for early-stage Alzheimer's disease monitoring and demonstrates the viability of using frozen LLMs for clinical data analysis.

Abstract: We explore a lightweight framework that adapts frozen large language models

and context within the language model space to generate accurate forecasts
without model fine-tuning. Applied to neuropsychological assessments, it
achieves accurate and reliable performance even with minimal training data,
showing promise for early-stage Alzheimer's monitoring.

### [10] [AfriMTEB and AfriE5: Benchmarking and Adapting Text Embedding Models for African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23896)
*Kosei Uemura,Miaoran Zhang,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AfriMTEB expands multilingual text embedding benchmarks to cover 59 African languages across 14 tasks and 38 datasets, while AfriE5 achieves SOTA performance through cross-lingual contrastive distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African languages are underrepresented in existing multilingual text embedding benchmarks like MMTEB, with tasks often repurposed from translation benchmarks rather than including native African language tasks.

Method: Created AfriMTEB benchmark covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets including 6 new datasets. Developed AfriE5 by adapting mE5 model through cross-lingual contrastive distillation for African languages.

Result: AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines including Gemini-Embeddings and mE5. New datasets span 14-56 African languages and introduce novel tasks like hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion classification.

Conclusion: AfriMTEB addresses the underrepresentation of African languages in text embedding benchmarks, and AfriE5 demonstrates effective adaptation of existing models to achieve superior performance on African language tasks.

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

### [11] [Breaking the Benchmark: Revealing LLM Bias via Minimal Contextual Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23921)
*Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab,Mahammed Kamruzzaman,Arshia Gharooni,Gene Louis Kim,Vasanth Sarathy,Ninareh Mehrabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show stereotypical biases due to training data, and current bias alignment methods are brittle. A new augmentation framework applied to BBQ dataset reveals LLMs are susceptible to input perturbations, increasing stereotypical behavior, especially for less studied communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs demonstrate stereotypical biases from training data, and existing bias mitigation approaches are fragile. There's a need to understand how LLMs respond to input perturbations and their bias susceptibility across different demographic groups.

Method: Developed a novel plug-and-play augmentation framework with three steps, applied to the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ) dataset to test LLM robustness to input perturbations.

Result: LLMs (including state-of-the-art open and closed weight models) show increased stereotypical behavior when inputs are perturbed, with higher bias susceptibility for less studied demographic communities.

Conclusion: Current bias alignment methods are insufficient, and fairness research needs expansion to include more diverse communities, as models show greater bias vulnerability for underrepresented groups.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

### [12] [Agent-based Automated Claim Matching with Instruction-following LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23924)
*Dina Pisarevskaya,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-step LLM pipeline for automated claim matching: first generates prompts with LLMs, then performs binary classification for claim matching. LLM-generated prompts outperform human-crafted ones, and smaller LLMs can match larger ones in prompt generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated claim matching approach using instruction-following LLMs that can outperform state-of-the-art methods with human-generated prompts while being computationally efficient.

Method: Two-step pipeline: 1) Generate prompts using LLMs, 2) Perform claim matching as binary classification using LLMs. Investigated using different LLMs for each step and analyzed the prompt generation process.

Result: LLM-generated prompts outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts. Smaller LLMs can perform as well as larger ones in prompt generation, saving computational resources. Different LLMs can be effectively used for each pipeline step.

Conclusion: The proposed agent-based approach with LLMs provides an effective automated claim matching solution that outperforms human-crafted prompts while offering computational efficiency and insights into LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

*Soham Satyadharma,Fatemeh Sheikholeslami,Swati Kaul,Aziz Umit Batur,Suleiman A. Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training-free auto-prompting cascade for LLMs to assess product quality in e-commerce, improving precision/recall by 8-10% while reducing expert effort by 99%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between general language understanding and domain-specific knowledge in complex industrial catalogs without requiring training labels or model fine-tuning.

Method: Automatically generates and refines prompts starting from human-crafted seeds, progressively optimizing instructions for catalog-specific requirements across thousands of product category-attribute pairs.

Result: Improves precision and recall by 8-10% over chain-of-thought prompting, reduces domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute (99% reduction), and generalizes across five languages and multiple quality assessment tasks.

Conclusion: The auto-prompt cascade effectively scales domain-specific knowledge application in industrial settings while dramatically reducing human effort and maintaining performance across languages and tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

### [15] [Uncovering the Potential Risks in Unlearning: Danger of English-only Unlearning in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23949)
*Kyomin Hwang,Hyeonjin Kim,Seungyeon Kim,Sunghyun Wee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies language confusion as a critical issue in multilingual LLM unlearning, where models respond in different languages than the input prompt, causing standard reference-based metrics to fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed insufficient multilingual knowledge erasure using only English data, but their analyses were performance-oriented. This paper shifts focus to evaluation and addresses language confusion that occurs when multilingual LLMs are fully fine-tuned with parallel multilingual datasets before unlearning.

Method: The authors tackle language confusion in three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to quantify pervasive language confusion, (2) demonstrate reference-based metrics produce false negatives when N-Mix is high, and (3) propose semantic-based metrics to directly assess generated content.

Result: The study shows language confusion is consistent and widespread in multilingual LLMs, and reveals that standard reference-based evaluation metrics fail when language confusion occurs, leading to inaccurate assessment of unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: There is a need for new semantic-based evaluation metrics that can directly assess the content of generated sentences, as traditional reference-based metrics are inadequate for evaluating multilingual unlearning when language confusion is present.

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

### [16] [M-Eval: A Heterogeneity-Based Framework for Multi-evidence Validation in Medical RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23995)
*Mengzhou Sun,Sendong Zhao,Jianyu Chen,Haochun Wang,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Eval is a new method that uses heterogeneity analysis from Evidence-Based Medicine to detect factual errors in Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) medical systems by verifying responses against multiple evidence sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems in medical QA generate incorrect information (hallucinations) and fail to properly use external knowledge, leading to unreliable responses.

Method: Extracts additional medical literature from external knowledge bases, retrieves evidence documents from RAG system, and uses heterogeneity analysis to check if evidence supports different viewpoints in the response while assessing evidence reliability.

Result: Shows improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs, helping detect errors in RAG-based medical systems.

Conclusion: M-Eval makes LLM applications more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors by improving the verification of medical responses.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the
applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PICOs-RAG improves evidence-based medicine queries by expanding and normalizing them using PICO format, enhancing retrieval efficiency by up to 8.8% compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle with complex clinical queries that lack information or use imprecise language, leading to irrelevant evidence retrieval and unhelpful answers in evidence-based medicine.

Method: PICOs-RAG expands and normalizes user queries into professional format using PICO (Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework to extract key information for improved retrieval.

Result: The approach achieves up to 8.8% improvement in retrieval efficiency and relevance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: PICOs-RAG enhances large language models' performance to serve as helpful and reliable medical assistants in evidence-based medicine by improving query processing and evidence retrieval.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

*Mengzhou Sun,Sendong Zhao,Jianyu Chen,Haochun Wang,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method for improving evidence-based medicine using LLMs by re-ranking and filtering medical evidence through meta-analysis principles, achieving up to 11.4% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently distinguish high-quality evidence, which is crucial for reducing misdiagnoses in clinical practice.

Method: Combines several EBM methods to emulate meta-analysis, including reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis to filter and re-rank medical evidence for LLMs.

Result: Shows an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in experiments, successfully enabling RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from PubMed dataset.

Conclusion: The method reduces infusion of incorrect knowledge into responses and helps users receive more effective replies in evidence-based medicine applications.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

### [19] [TEXT2DB: Integration-Aware Information Extraction with Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24014)
*Yizhu Jiao,Sha Li,Sizhe Zhou,Heng Ji,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TEXT2DB, a new information extraction formulation that integrates IE output with target databases, and introduces OPAL, an LLM agent framework for adapting to diverse database schemas through code-based planning and IE model calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IE systems face challenges in utilizing extracted information due to mismatches between IE ontologies and downstream application needs, requiring better integration with target databases.

Method: Proposes OPAL framework with three components: Observer (interacts with database), Planner (generates code-based plans with IE model calls), and Analyzer (provides feedback on code quality before execution).

Result: OPAL successfully adapts to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling required IE models, though challenges remain with large databases and extraction hallucination.

Conclusion: The TEXT2DB formulation and OPAL framework effectively address the integration of IE output with target databases, but complex dependencies and extraction hallucination require further investigation.

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge
from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to
the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We
propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE
output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a
document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the
database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.
This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and
adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate
this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as
data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an
LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer
component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that
generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component
that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments
show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating
different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight
difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies
and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

### [20] [Teaching LLMs to Abstain via Fine-Grained Semantic Confidence Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24020)
*Hao An,Yang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using fine-grained semantic confidence rewards to help LLMs better abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LLMs rely on coarse-grained signals like overall confidence scores, leading to imprecise awareness of knowledge boundaries.

Method: Proposes FiSCoRe framework that samples multiple candidate answers, conducts semantic clustering, and trains LLMs to retain answers in high-confidence clusters while discarding low-confidence ones.

Result: Significantly enhances reliability in both in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: The fine-grained semantic confidence approach effectively promotes accurate post-hoc abstention in LLMs.

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Yadong Zhang,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecKD is a knowledge distillation framework that uses a dynamic gating mechanism to selectively apply distillation loss only to tokens where the teacher model is confident, avoiding learning from uncertain predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional KD applies distillation loss uniformly across all tokens, forcing students to learn from teacher's uncertain predictions which introduces noise and harms performance, especially with large teacher-student gaps.

Method: Uses speculative decoding-inspired token-level gating: student's token proposals are verified against teacher's distribution, with distillation loss applied only to accepted tokens and masked for rejected tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines across diverse text generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results with more stable training.

Conclusion: SpecKD provides a plug-and-play framework that enables more effective knowledge distillation by selectively focusing on confident teacher predictions, leading to more capable student models.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

*Saujas Vaduguru,Yilun Hua,Yoav Artzi,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training large multimodal models to form linguistic conventions through simulated reference games, enabling efficient communication with humans by reducing message length while increasing success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use shared conversational context to communicate more efficiently over time through ad hoc linguistic conventions. The goal is to enable AI models to similarly form conventions for efficient communication without needing additional human data.

Method: Using simulated reference games between models involving photographs and tangram images. The approach trains models to develop conventions through repeated interactions, requiring both success and cost considerations in training.

Result: Models reduced message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over interactions. Human listeners responded faster when interacting with convention-forming models. Training with both success and cost factors was necessary for convention formation.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables AI models to form linguistic conventions for efficient communication with humans, demonstrating that both success and cost considerations are essential for convention formation in multimodal models.

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

*In Gim,Zhiyao Ma,Seung-seob Lee,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pie is a programmable LLM serving system that decomposes token generation into fine-grained handlers, allowing applications to implement custom KV cache strategies and generation logic through user-provided inferlets executed in WebAssembly sandboxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems use monolithic token generation loops that struggle with diverse reasoning strategies and agentic workflows, limiting flexibility and efficiency for emerging LLM applications.

Method: Decomposes traditional generation loop into fine-grained service handlers, delegates control to user-provided inferlets (programs), and executes them using WebAssembly for lightweight sandboxing.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x higher) on agentic workflows through application-specific optimizations.

Conclusion: Pie enables flexible and efficient LLM serving by allowing applications to implement custom optimizations without modifying the serving system, demonstrating substantial performance improvements for agentic workflows.

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning
strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing
serving systems built on a monolithic token generation loop. This paper
introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and
efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained
service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation
process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications
to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly
integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without
requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using
WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows
Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency
overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x
higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

TL;DR: HalloMTBench is a multilingual benchmark for detecting hallucinations in LLM-based machine translation across 11 language directions, revealing specific failure patterns like model scale effects and RL-amplified language mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT benchmarks fail to expose hallucination vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs, necessitating a specialized diagnostic framework to identify and categorize translation failures.

Method: Created a taxonomy separating Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment, employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate candidates, used ensemble LLM judges and expert validation to curate 5,435 high-quality instances across 11 English-to-X directions.

Result: Evaluation of 17 LLMs revealed distinct hallucination triggers including model scale effects, source length sensitivity, linguistic biases, and RL-amplified language mixing.

Conclusion: HalloMTBench provides a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing LLM translation failures and understanding hallucination patterns in multilingual translation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for LLMs that cover a large number of languages and cultures, limiting our understanding of how these models perform across different cultural contexts.

Method: Constructed a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark with 335 researchers from 65 countries, covering 116 language varieties across 5 continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing systems, with over 50% of examples referencing culturally-specific elements.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform well overall but show significant performance gaps in lower-resource languages (up to 37% accuracy gap), with open models generally performing worse than proprietary models.

Conclusion: Everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement in many languages and cultures, and Global PIQA highlights the wide diversity of cultures embedded in human language beyond just complex reasoning and expert knowledge capabilities.

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

TL;DR: This paper documents Bengali dialect diversity and explores computational modeling for regional speech recognition systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic research on computational processing of Bengali dialects is limited despite their linguistic richness, creating a need for dialect-specific language technologies.

Method: Documentation and analysis of phonetic and morphological properties of Bengali dialects, with exploration of computational models including Automatic Speech Recognition systems.

Result: Created a dataset of Bengali dialects that is released for public use, demonstrating feasibility of building computational models for regional varieties.

Conclusion: Computational modeling of Bengali dialects enables preservation of dialectal diversity and development of inclusive digital tools for Bengali-speaking communities.

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid advances in Text-to-SQL research, there's a gap between academic methods and real-world deployment due to limited integration tools.

Method: Establishes a universal execution paradigm with standardized interfaces and proposes a multi-actor collaboration mechanism using seven abstracted atomic actor components.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show collaborative workflows consistently outperform original individual methods.

Conclusion: Squrve opens up a new effective avenue for tackling complex real-world queries by unifying research advances with practical applications.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL technology has evolved rapidly, with diverse academic methods
achieving impressive results. However, deploying these techniques in real-world
systems remains challenging due to limited integration tools. Despite these
advances, we introduce Squrve, a unified, modular, and extensive Text-to-SQL
framework designed to bring together research advances and real-world
applications. Squrve first establishes a universal execution paradigm that
standardizes invocation interfaces, then proposes a multi-actor collaboration
mechanism based on seven abstracted effective atomic actor components.
Experiments on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that the collaborative
workflows consistently outperform the original individual methods, thereby
opening up a new effective avenue for tackling complex real-world queries. The

TL;DR: RL-trained LLM agents outperform prompt-based methods on legal document search, achieving 85% vs 78% accuracy, and benefit from longer multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning can significantly enhance LLM agent capabilities beyond prompt-based approaches by learning from experience.

Method: Used Reinforcement Learning to train a 14 Billion parameter LLM agent on a legal document search benchmark, exploring turn-restricted regimes during training and testing.

Result: RL-trained model achieved 85% accuracy compared to 78% for frontier class models, with better performance when allowed longer multi-turn horizons.

addition, we explore turn-restricted regimes, during training and at test-time,
that show these agents achieve better results if allowed to operate over longer
multi-turn horizons.

*Chanwoo Park,Suyoung Park,Yelim Ahn,Jongmin Kim,Jongyeon Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enhanced line-level filtering methods (PLD and PTF) that consider sequential document patterns improve language model performance by preserving valuable content that traditional methods discard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional line-level filtering techniques often remove valuable content that negatively impacts downstream model performance, creating a need for more intelligent filtering approaches.

Method: Proposed pattern-aware line-level deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF) that consider both line-level signals and their sequential distribution across documents.

Result: Models trained with these methods showed consistent improvements on multiple-choice benchmarks and significant accuracy gains on SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1 question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: Considering sequential document patterns in filtering techniques helps retain structurally important content and leads to better language model performance across different languages.

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level
deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic
methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

*Aaron Scott,Maike Züfle,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuSaG is the first German multimodal sarcasm detection dataset with 33 minutes of TV show content, featuring text, audio, and video modalities with human annotations. Benchmarking shows models perform best on text while humans rely more on audio, revealing gaps in current multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection is challenging for natural language understanding, especially with the rise of multimodal LLMs that need to integrate cues from audio and vision beyond just text. There's a lack of German multimodal sarcasm datasets.

Method: Created MuSaG dataset with 33 minutes of German TV show content, providing aligned text, audio, and video modalities with human annotations. Benchmarked 9 open-source and commercial models across text, audio, vision, and multimodal architectures.

Result: Models perform best on text-based sarcasm detection, while humans rely heavily on audio cues in conversational settings. This reveals a significant gap between current multimodal models and human perception in realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: There's a need for better multimodal models that can effectively integrate audio cues like humans do. MuSaG dataset is released publicly to support future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces KITGI, a benchmark for evaluating how external knowledge affects commonsense NLG. Using T5-Large, they show that removing key knowledge relations drops correctness from 91% to 6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of external knowledge integration in Natural Language Generation, specifically for commonsense generation tasks, and to create interpretable evaluation methods.

Method: Extended CommonGen dataset to create KITGI benchmark with retrieved ConceptNet relations. Used T5-Large model with two conditions: full external knowledge vs filtered knowledge (key relations removed). Three-stage interpretability method: identify/remove key knowledge, regenerate sentences, manually assess outputs.

Result: Sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91% correctness in commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Filtered knowledge condition drastically reduced performance to 6% correctness.

Conclusion: Relevant external knowledge is critical for maintaining coherence and concept coverage in NLG. Highlights need for interpretable, knowledge-enhanced systems and evaluation frameworks that capture underlying reasoning beyond surface metrics.

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

*Jian Gu,Aldeida Aleti,Chunyang Chen,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for parametric knowledge transfer (PKT) across LLMs of different scales using semantic alignment in latent space with activations as the transfer medium, overcoming neural incompatibility issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable effective and efficient knowledge transfer across LLMs of different scales, addressing the limitations of existing methods due to architectural and parametric differences (neural incompatibility) that prevent direct parameter reuse.

Method: Uses semantic alignment in latent space with activations as the medium for layer-wise knowledge transfer, rather than directly reusing layer parameters.

Result: Outperforms prior work and better aligns model behaviors across varying scales, as demonstrated by evaluations on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enables cross-scale knowledge transfer and provides insights into latent semantic alignment, revealing key factors that ease the transfer process.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to categorize LLM hallucinations along knowledge and certainty axes, with model-specific dataset construction and validation through steering mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on external properties of hallucinations, overlooking that different underlying mechanisms may require tailored mitigation strategies.

Method: Categorizes hallucinations along knowledge and certainty axes using model-specific dataset construction, applies steering mitigation for validation, and introduces new evaluation metrics.

Result: Shows significant difference between knowledge-based hallucination types, reveals models hallucinate despite shared parametric knowledge, and identifies critical cases where models hallucinate with certainty despite having correct knowledge.

Conclusion: Highlights importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in hallucination analysis and calls for targeted mitigation approaches based on underlying factors.

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that
consider the hallucination underlying factors.

*Teague McMillan,Gabriele Dominici,Martin Gjoreski,Marc Langheinrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often produce unfaithful explanations that don't reflect their actual reasoning, which is especially problematic in healthcare. The study examines how inference and training choices affect explanation faithfulness across different models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfaithful explanations in LLMs can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decision support in healthcare settings, where reliability is critical.

Method: Evaluated three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing) datasets, manipulating few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedures.

Result: Few-shot example quantity and quality significantly impact faithfulness; faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; instruction-tuning improves faithfulness on MedQA.

Conclusion: Careful selection of few-shot examples and prompting strategies can enhance LLM interpretability and trustworthiness in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

*Ahmad Ghannam,Naif Alharthi,Faris Alasmary,Kholood Al Tabash,Shouq Sadah,Lahouari Ghouti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multimodal approach for Arabic diacritic restoration combining text and speech information using CATT encoder for text and Whisper encoder for speech, with two integration strategies: early fusion and cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Arabic dialectal diacritic restoration by leveraging both textual and speech information, addressing the limitations of text-only approaches.

Method: Uses CATT encoder for text representation and Whisper encoder for speech. Two integration strategies: (1) early fusion with speech tokens averaged and projected, (2) cross-attention fusion. Speech input is randomly deactivated during training for robustness.

Result: Achieved WER of 0.25 and CER of 0.9 on development set; WER of 0.55 and CER of 0.13 on test set.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining text and speech information effectively improves Arabic diacritic restoration performance, with the model capable of working with or without speech input.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are predominantly trained on adult conversational data, creating challenges for generating authentic, age-appropriate dialogue for children in specialized applications.

Method: Comparative study of 5 LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b, NorBloom-7b) using blind evaluation by 11 education professionals comparing real child interviews with LLM-generated text for 5- and 9-year-olds.

Result: Evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75) and higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children. GPT-4 and NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, but most models generated language perceived as more linguistically advanced than target age groups.

Conclusion: Findings highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for specialized applications involving children, especially in low-resource languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational
data, face significant challenges when generating authentic, child-like
dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,

children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived
as more linguistically advanced than the target age groups. These findings
highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that memorization in transformers can be identified and removed through weight decomposition based on loss curvature, with minimal impact on general reasoning while specifically affecting fact retrieval and arithmetic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how memorization is represented in transformer models and develop methods to remove it while preserving model performance on general tasks.

Method: Uses loss landscape curvature analysis to identify memorized components in weights, then applies weight editing to suppress memorization while maintaining low perplexity.

Result: Successfully removes untargeted memorized data more effectively than BalancedSubnet, with fact retrieval and arithmetic tasks specifically affected while general reasoning is conserved.

Conclusion: Memorization can be disentangled and removed through curvature-based weight editing, revealing that tasks like math and fact retrieval rely on specialized weight directions rather than general mechanisms.

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can translate human natural language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge during hierarchical reinforcement learning, which is critical for enabling developmental learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks.

Method: Applied a structured evaluation framework to measure translation performance of GPT, Claude, Deepseek and Grok LLMs across different internal symbolic partitions generated by hierarchical reinforcement learning in Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments.

Result: LLMs demonstrate some ability to translate natural language into symbolic representations of environment dynamics, but performance is highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in representation alignment capacity, highlighting the need for further research on robust alignment between language and internal agent representations.

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental
learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we
investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural
language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge
during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation
framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,
Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions
generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze
and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate
some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of
the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition
granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs
capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further
research on robust alignment between language and internal agent
representations.

TL;DR: MERGE is a method for automatically generating high-quality NLI test variants by replacing open-class words while preserving reasoning, revealing that models perform 4-20% worse on these minimally altered problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of NLI benchmarks is costly, and automatic generation of high-quality variants is difficult, highlighting the need for automated methods to test model robustness.

Method: Propose MERGE methodology that generates reasoning-preserving variants of NLI problems by replacing open-class words while maintaining the underlying logical structure.

Result: NLI models perform 4-20% worse on MERGE variants compared to original problems, showing poor generalizability even with minimal changes.

Conclusion: Current NLI models lack robustness and generalizability, as demonstrated by significant performance drops on reasoning-preserving variants generated through minimal word replacements.

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LATR is a novel rollout strategy that improves trajectory diversity in RLVR by using lookahead tree-based branching at high-uncertainty steps, accelerating policy learning by 131% and improving final performance by 4.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR pipelines suffer from limited trajectory diversity due to token-level stochastic sampling, which leads to homogeneous reasoning paths and diminished return signals for policy learning.

Method: LATR operates in three stages: branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, performing lookahead simulation for each branch, and pruning branches that show prolonged similarity during simulation.

Result: LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and DAPO algorithms across different reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LATR effectively addresses the trajectory diversity bottleneck in RLVR and significantly enhances policy learning efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

*Zhiheng Xi,Jixuan Huang,Xin Guo,Boyang Hong,Dingwen Yang,Xiaoran Fan,Shuo Li,Zehui Chen,Junjie Ye,Siyu Yuan,Zhengyin Du,Xuesong Yao,Yufei Xu,Jiecao Chen,Rui Zheng,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Critique-RL is an online RL approach that trains critiquing language models without stronger supervision using a two-player paradigm and two-stage optimization to improve both discriminability and helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for training critiquing language models rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data, which limits scalability and accessibility.

Method: Two-player paradigm with actor-critic interaction, followed by two-stage optimization: Stage I reinforces discriminability with rule-based rewards, Stage II improves helpfulness with indirect rewards while maintaining discriminability via regularization.

Result: Substantial performance improvements across various tasks and models, achieving 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B.

Conclusion: Critique-RL effectively develops critiquing language models without stronger supervision, demonstrating significant performance gains and potential for improving LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

### [43] [Beyond MCQ: An Open-Ended Arabic Cultural QA Benchmark with Dialect Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24328)
*Hunzalah Hassan Bhatti,Firoj Alam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a comprehensive method to evaluate LLMs on culturally grounded and dialectal Arabic content, revealing performance gaps in dialects and showing that CoT improves reasoning but yields mixed results on automatic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform unevenly on culturally grounded and dialectal content across languages, particularly for Arabic dialects, highlighting the need for more inclusive evaluation methods.

Method: Translate MSA questions to English and Arabic dialects, convert to open-ended questions, benchmark LLMs in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and generate CoT rationales for step-by-step reasoning.

Result: Models underperform on Arabic dialects, Arabic-centric models excel at MCQs but struggle with OEQs, and CoT improves judged correctness while showing mixed results on n-gram metrics.

Conclusion: The study reveals persistent gaps in dialect-specific knowledge and demonstrates the value of CoT for reasoning, with the developed dataset supporting future research on linguistically inclusive evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

### [44] [LongWeave: A Long-Form Generation Benchmark Bridging Real-World Relevance and Verifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24345)
*Zikai Xiao,Fei Huang,Jianhong Tu,Jianhui Wei,Wen Ma,Yuxuan Zhou,Jian Wu,Bowen Yu,Zuozhu Liu,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongWeave is a new benchmark for evaluating long-form generation in LLMs that balances real-world scenarios with verifiable assessment using Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for long-form generation either use real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or synthetic setups that overlook real-world intricacies, creating a need for better evaluation methods.

Method: Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval) constructs tasks by defining verifiable targets within real-world scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual materials, and constraints based on these targets.

Result: Evaluation of 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world complexity and output length increase.

Conclusion: LongWeave provides a rigorous framework for assessing model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints, supporting customizable input/output lengths up to 64K/8K tokens across seven distinct tasks.

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

*Matthew Shardlow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learning transformations between sentence embeddings to simplify text complexity, showing promising results compared to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if sentence embeddings can preserve text complexity and enable effective text simplification through embedding space transformations.

Method: Using a small feed forward neural network to learn transformations between high-complexity and low-complexity sentence embeddings, compared against Seq2Seq and LLM approaches.

Result: The method preserves complexity levels in reconstructed text and works on unseen datasets (MedEASI) and other languages (ES, DE), showing encouraging performance despite smaller model size.

Conclusion: Learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction for developing small but powerful models for text simplification and other NLG tasks.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to give approximations of the original
texts used to create them. We explore this effect in the context of text
simplification, demonstrating that reconstructed text embeddings preserve
complexity levels. We experiment with a small feed forward neural network to
effectively learn a transformation between sentence embeddings representing
high-complexity and low-complexity texts. We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq
and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller
learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as
datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE). We conclude that
learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction
for future research and has potential to unlock the ability to develop small,
but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language
generation tasks.

*Guangyu Xie,Yice Zhang,Jianzhu Bao,Qianlong Wang,Yang Sun,Bingbing Wang,Ruifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPEFFDIST is a comprehensive and efficient distillation framework for sentiment analysis that uses attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data filtering to enable 3B student models to match 20x larger teacher models' performance with only 10% of the data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods for sentiment analysis face two key challenges: manually written instructions lack diversity and quantity, and large-scale user texts incur high computational costs, limiting practicality.

Method: The framework consists of two key modules: attribute-based automatic instruction construction to generate diverse instructions, and difficulty-based data filtering to reduce computational costs by selecting only the most informative data.

Result: 3B student models achieved performance comparable to 20x larger teacher models on most tasks, and the approach demonstrated superior data efficiency, achieving the same performance level with only 10% of the data compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: COMPEFFDIST provides an effective solution for developing lightweight sentiment analysis models through comprehensive knowledge distillation while maintaining high efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

*Ken Gu,Advait Bhat,Mike A Merrill,Robert West,Xin Liu,Daniel McDuff,Tim Althoff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthWorlds framework disentangles reasoning from factual knowledge by creating parallel real and synthetic worlds with identical structure, enabling precise evaluation of LM reasoning ability independent of memorized knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM evaluation methods cannot cleanly separate reasoning ability from factual recall, as benchmark performance often reflects memorized knowledge rather than genuine reasoning.

Method: Construct parallel corpora with real-mapped and synthetic-mapped worlds having identical interconnected structure. Design mirrored tasks (multi-hop QA and page navigation) that maintain equal reasoning difficulty across both worlds.

Result: Experiments reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap - performance boost from memorized parametric knowledge. Knowledge acquisition/integration mechanisms reduce but don't eliminate this gap.

Conclusion: SynthWorlds provides a controlled, scalable environment for precise evaluation of LM reasoning vs memorization, enabling testable comparisons that were previously challenging.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by
their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often
reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and
approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution)
cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that
disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds,
we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical
interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit
parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is
meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case
studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal
reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g.,
closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings
reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost
models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition
and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting
opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable,
SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that
were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of
reasoning and memorization.

*Julian Valline,Cedric Lothritz,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LuxIT is a new monolingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish created to address data scarcity, but fine-tuning smaller LLMs with it shows mixed results on language proficiency tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuned LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages like Luxembourgish due to lack of high-quality training data.

Method: Created LuxIT dataset by synthesizing from native Luxembourgish texts using DeepSeek-R1-0528, applied LLM-as-a-judge quality assurance, and fine-tuned smaller LLMs on this dataset.

Result: Benchmarking on Luxembourgish proficiency exams showed mixed results with significant performance variation across different models.

Conclusion: LuxIT is a valuable contribution to Luxembourgish NLP with replicable methodology, but further research is needed to optimize its application.

Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is often
limited in low-resource linguistic settings due to a lack of high-quality
training data. We introduce LuxIT, a novel, monolingual instruction tuning
dataset for Luxembourgish developed to mitigate this challenge. We synthesize
the dataset from a corpus of native Luxembourgish texts, utilizing
DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following
generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge
approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune
several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base
models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields
mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.
LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language
processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings
highlight the need for further research to optimize its application.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of three AI models (GPT-4o, Ansari AI, Fanar) for Islamic guidance using dual-agent framework shows GPT-4o performs best but all models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic content and citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance but risk misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally inconsistent responses, necessitating evaluation of their reliability.

Method: Dual-agent framework with quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and qualitative agent for five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (Tone, Depth, Originality).

Result: GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). GPT-4o had highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led qualitative pairwise wins (116/200).

Conclusion: Despite relatively strong performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic content and citations. Study underscores need for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives for more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk
misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally
inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar
on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes
domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARTA, a black-box adversarial paraphrasing method that generates semantically equivalent but grammatically correct text queries to degrade segmentation performance in multimodal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on perturbing image inputs, but semantically equivalent textual paraphrases - crucial in real-world applications where users express the same intent in varied ways - remain underexplored for reasoning segmentation tasks.

Method: SPARTA is a black-box, sentence-level optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning to generate adversarial paraphrases.

Result: SPARTA achieves significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets, revealing that advanced reasoning segmentation models remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing.

Conclusion: Multimodal large language models for reasoning segmentation are vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing attacks even under strict semantic and grammatical constraints, highlighting an important robustness gap.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new taxonomy and best practices for multilingual LLM benchmarking, focusing on European languages and advocating for greater language and culture sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks are primarily English-focused, leaving non-English languages under-evaluated despite growing LLM capabilities and AI development.

Method: The authors provide an overview of recent LLM benchmarking developments and propose a new taxonomy specifically designed for multilingual scenarios, along with quality standards for coordinated benchmark development.

Result: A framework for categorizing multilingual benchmarks and a set of best practices for developing more culturally and linguistically sensitive evaluation methods for European languages.

Conclusion: There is a need for more coordinated and culturally aware benchmark development for non-English languages, with specific recommendations for improving multilingual LLM evaluation.

Abstract: While new benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are being developed
continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and AI in
general, using and evaluating LLMs in non-English languages remains a
little-charted landscape. We give a concise overview of recent developments in
LLM benchmarking, and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of
benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or non-English use scenarios. We
further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead
to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for European languages. Among
other recommendations, we advocate for a higher language and culture
sensitivity of evaluation methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerFine is a training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalized text generation through iterative, profile-grounded feedback between generator and critic LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented approaches like LaMP and PGraphRAG produce outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style, failing to maintain personalization alignment.

Method: Unified training-free framework with iterative refinement: generator produces drafts conditioned on retrieved profiles, critic provides structured feedback on tone/vocabulary/structure/topicality, generator revises using knockout strategy to retain stronger drafts.

Result: Consistent improvements over PGraphRAG across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 iterations, and scalability with critic size.

Conclusion: Post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful training-free and model-agnostic paradigm for personalized LLM generation.

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

TL;DR: This survey analyzes how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning enhancement work synergistically in Agentic Systems to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, proposing a taxonomy for different hallucination types and a unified framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination remains a key obstacle for reliable LLM deployment in real-world applications, and while RAG and reasoning enhancement are effective mitigation strategies, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms haven't been systematically examined.

Method: Adopts an application-oriented perspective, proposes a taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically examines how RAG and reasoning address each type, and presents a unified framework.

Result: The survey provides a systematic analysis of how RAG and reasoning enhancement work together in Agentic Systems to mitigate different types of hallucinations, supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that RAG and reasoning enhancement can be effectively integrated in Agentic Systems to balance creativity and reliability in LLMs, moving beyond mere hallucination suppression to a more nuanced approach.

Abstract: Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of
large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among
various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to
balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and
underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been
systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective
of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their
integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy
distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically
examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework
supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Scientific talks are a growing medium for disseminating research, and
automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches a talk
would be highly valuable for researchers and students alike. We introduce
Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and
unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research
on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind,
containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly
improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of
the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic
representations from spoken scientific content. The dataset and trained models
are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating

TL;DR: A novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs using semantic priming simulations, enabling direct comparison between LLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' inherent social biases are a pressing concern, and detecting implicit biases is challenging. Developing evaluation methods that assess implicit knowledge representations in LLMs is essential.

Method: Prompt-based approach using word association networks that simulate semantic priming, tapping into implicit relational structures encoded in LLMs for both quantitative and qualitative bias assessment.

Result: Revealed both convergences and divergences between LLM and human biases across gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political party, providing new perspectives on LLM risks.

Conclusion: The methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and generalizable framework for evaluating biases across LLMs and humans, advancing transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

Motivation: Traditional confidence calibration methods fail to capture reasoning needed for accurate assessment. Precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain and require multiple generations.

Method: Proposes Self-Critique for LLMs to critique and optimize confidence, and CritiCal - a novel Critique Calibration training method using natural language critiques instead of direct numerical optimization.

Result: CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other baselines, surpassing GPT-4o in complex reasoning tasks. Shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: Natural language critiques effectively enhance LLM confidence calibration, improving reliability for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Accurate confidence calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical
for safe use in high-stakes domains, where clear verbalized confidence enhances
user trust. Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions
often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.
We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for
confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain
and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language
critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique:
uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows
confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended
scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training?
We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their
confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration
training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence
calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that
CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive
baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning
tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution
settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

### [57] [Levée d'ambiguïtés par grammaires locales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24530)
*Eric G. C. Laporte*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a formal description of a lexical disambiguation method for part-of-speech tagging that aims for zero silence rate, implemented in INTEX system. It emphasizes the need to verify transducer interactions and test local grammars carefully.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many words are ambiguous in their part-of-speech, but context reduces this ambiguity. Lexical tagging is crucial for various NLP applications like spelling correction, grammar checking, and text analysis. The goal is to achieve zero silence rate where correct tags are never discarded.

Method: The method uses local disambiguation grammar implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system. It involves analyzing transducer paths and their interactions, rather than considering them separately. Multiple transducers are combined and their interactions must be verified.

Result: The paper shows that verifying local disambiguation grammar requires considering transducer interactions, not just individual paths. Grammatical intuitions may be inaccurate due to unforeseen constructions, requiring careful testing of local grammars.

Conclusion: To achieve zero silence rate in lexical disambiguation, local grammars must be carefully tested with detailed specifications of what they will do when applied to texts. Transducer interactions and combinations cannot be predicted by considering them in isolation.

Abstract: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However,
when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.
Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS
associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.
The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language
processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,
expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.
Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural
language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce
multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct
solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence
rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is
unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a
lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate
and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal
description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation
grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer
paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a
combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by
considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling
of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come
spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often
due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is
targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed
specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be
necessary.

*Venkata S Govindarajan,Laura Biester*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes intentionally bad humor from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, finding that standard humor detection models fail on this corpus and that LLMs over-exaggerate literary devices when imitating this style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the diversity of textual humor, including intentionally bad humor, which has been understudied in computational humor research.

Method: Curated and analyzed a novel corpus from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, evaluated standard humor detection models, analyzed literary devices, and tested LLMs for synthesizing contest-style sentences.

Result: Standard humor detection models performed poorly on the bad humor corpus. Human-written sentences combine features from existing humor datasets with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs imitate the form but over-use certain literary devices and create more novel adjective-noun bigrams than humans.

Conclusion: Intentionally bad humor represents a distinct category that challenges existing computational models, and LLMs struggle to authentically reproduce this style without over-exaggeration.

Abstract: Textual humor is enormously diverse and computational studies need to account
for this range, including intentionally bad humor. In this paper, we curate and
analyze a novel corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest to
better understand "bad" humor in English. Standard humor detection models
perform poorly on our corpus, and an analysis of literary devices finds that
these sentences combine features common in existing humor datasets (e.g., puns,
irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs prompted to synthesize
contest-style sentences imitate the form but exaggerate the effect by
over-using certain literary devices, and including far more novel
adjective-noun bigrams than human writers. Data, code and analysis are

### [59] [Open Korean Historical Corpus: A Millennia-Scale Diachronic Collection of Public Domain Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24541)
*Seyoung Song,Nawon Kim,Songeun Chae,Kiwoong Park,Jiho Jin,Haneul Yoo,Kyunghyun Cho,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages to address the lack of historical Korean language resources in NLP, enabling quantitative analysis of linguistic shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in NLP research on Korean linguistic evolution due to lack of accessible historical corpora, particularly the transition from Chinese characters to Hangul alphabet.

Method: Created the Open Korean Historical Corpus containing 18 million documents and 5 billion tokens from 19 sources spanning 7th century to 2025, covering multiple languages and writing systems including Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and Hanja-Hangul mixed script.

Result: Quantitative analysis revealed: Idu usage peaked in 1860s then declined sharply; rapid transition from Hanja to Hangul started around 1890; North Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51x higher out-of-vocabulary rates.

Conclusion: The corpus provides a foundational resource for quantitative diachronic analysis of Korean language history and can serve as pre-training corpus for large language models to improve understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary and archaic writing systems.

Abstract: The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between
its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the
Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely
unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address
this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly
licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as
under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5
billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We
leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1)
Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from
Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North
Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times
higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for
quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean
language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language
models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in
modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

*Raphaël Bagat,Irina Illina,Emmanuel Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BEARD is a novel framework that adapts Whisper's encoder using unlabeled data through BEST-RQ objective and knowledge distillation, achieving 12% relative improvement in ASR performance for air traffic control domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled data is scarce, particularly in specialized domains like air traffic control with non-native speech, noise, and specialized phraseology.

Method: BEARD combines BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen teacher encoder to adapt Whisper's encoder using unlabeled data, ensuring complementarity with the pre-trained decoder. Uses 5,000 hours of untranscribed speech for adaptation and 2 hours of transcribed speech for fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous baseline and fine-tuned models, achieving 12% relative improvement compared to the fine-tuned model on the ATCO2 corpus from air traffic control domain.

Conclusion: BEARD is the first work to use self-supervised learning for domain adaptation of Whisper, effectively addressing low-resource scenarios with minimal labeled data requirements.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual
training, struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled
data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training
and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder using
unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD
uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen
teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained
decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air
Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native
speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of
untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for
fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline
and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the
fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a
self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReplicationBench is an evaluation framework that tests AI agents' ability to replicate entire astrophysics research papers, revealing current models score under 20% and identifying diverse failure modes in scientific research workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the faithfulness and correctness of AI agents as scientific research assistants for novel research, particularly in data-driven domains like astrophysics that require minimal real-world experimentation.

Method: Split astrophysics papers into tasks co-developed with original authors to replicate core contributions (experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, codebase), enabling objective evaluation of faithfulness and correctness.

Result: Current frontier language models perform poorly on ReplicationBench, with the best-performing models scoring under 20%, and analysis reveals rich, diverse failure modes for agents in scientific research.

Conclusion: ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark for paper-scale astrophysics research tasks, provides insights generalizable to other data-driven sciences, and offers a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants,
and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows.
However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the
underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as
research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework
that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the
astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on
archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world
experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific
research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the
paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data
analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper
authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of
both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical
accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current
frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under
20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain
experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific
research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale,
expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent
performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides
a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific
research.

*Guoxin Chen,Jing Wu,Xinjie Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ruihua Song,Chengxi Li,Kai Fan,Dayiheng Liu,Minpeng Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReForm introduces a reflective autoformalization method that integrates semantic consistency evaluation to iteratively generate and refine formal statements from natural language mathematics, achieving significant improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches treat autoformalization as simple translation and lack mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement, leading to formal statements that don't preserve the original problem's semantic intent.

Method: ReForm integrates semantic consistency evaluation into autoformalization, enabling iterative generation, assessment, and self-correction. It uses Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO) with different rewards at different positions to train both accurate autoformalization and semantic validation.

Result: ReForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over strongest baselines across four autoformalization benchmarks. The ConsistencyCheck benchmark reveals that even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

Conclusion: Reflective autoformalization with integrated semantic evaluation significantly improves formal statement generation, and autoformalization remains inherently difficult even for human experts.

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into
machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical
reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large
Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they
often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation
arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic
translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative
refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we
propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates
semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This
enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its
semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive
refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce
Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different
rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both
accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing
superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive
experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm
achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest
baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce
ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only
validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently
difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

*Yicun Yang,Cong Wang,Shaobo Wang,Zichen Wen,Biqing Qi,Hanlin Xu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes dLLM-Var, a diffusion-based LLM with variable generation lengths that predicts [EOS] tokens to enable flexible text generation without pre-specified length constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based LLMs require fixed generation lengths determined before decoding, causing efficiency and flexibility issues in real-world applications.

Method: Train diffusion LLM to predict [EOS] tokens, enabling variable-length generation with block diffusion while maintaining global bi-directional attention and high parallelism.

Result: Achieves 30.1x speedup over traditional dLLM inference and 2.4x speedup over autoregressive models like Qwen and Llama, with higher accuracy.

Conclusion: dLLM-Var enables practical use of diffusion LLMs in real-world applications by providing faster, more flexible, and more accurate text generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial
potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient
generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer
from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs
have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues
in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we
propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths,
abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately
predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to
natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability
of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over
traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to
autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher
accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and
supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models
have been released.

### [64] [Long-Context Modeling with Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention for On-Device LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24606)
*Siheng Xiong,Joe Zou,Faramarz Fekri,Yae Jee Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DHSA is a dynamic hierarchical sparse attention method that reduces quadratic attention costs for long-context LLMs by adaptively segmenting sequences into variable-length chunks and computing importance scores to preserve key token interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static sparse attention methods poorly adapt to content-dependent variations in attention, while dynamic approaches rely on predefined templates or heuristics that prune important tokens and limit accuracy across diverse tasks.

Method: DHSA dynamically segments sequences into variable-length chunks, computes chunk representations using length-normalized aggregation, upsamples chunk-level similarity scores to token-level similarities, and calculates importance scores to determine preserved token interactions.

Result: DHSA matches dense attention accuracy while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. It achieves 6-18% higher accuracy than block sparse attention with comparable or lower cost.

Conclusion: DHSA offers an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs by providing data-driven dynamic sparsity prediction without retraining, maintaining accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs,
especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods
such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to
reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent
variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has
proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend
on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce
generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their
accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods
for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention
(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity
online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into
variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the
token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying
chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged
embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the
chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate
importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be
preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and
LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing
prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other
representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves
consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower
cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prefix-based methods outperform LoRA for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in decoder-only LLMs, achieving up to 6% improvement on multilingual benchmarks while using only 1.23M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder-only LLMs like Llama and Mistral have strong multilingual capabilities, but adapting them to new tasks across languages remains challenging. Prefix-based techniques are less explored compared to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA.

Method: Comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods (soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, Llama Adapter) for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from English to 35+ languages, analyzing transfer across linguistic families and scripts, and scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B.

Result: Prefix methods outperform LoRA baselines by up to 6% on Belebele benchmark with Llama 3.1 8B, with similar improvements on Mistral v0.3 7B. Consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks using only 1.23M learning parameters.

Conclusion: Prefix-based techniques are an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA, particularly in low-resource multilingual settings, demonstrating strong zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities.

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

*William Held,David Hall,Percy Liang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Relative scaling laws track performance gaps between test distributions as models scale, revealing that scaling doesn't uniformly improve all subpopulations - some gaps converge while others diverge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scaling laws focus on aggregate performance but obscure performance disparities across heterogeneous subpopulations, making it unclear how scaling affects different domains, dialects, and risk categories.

Method: Trained 255 decoder-only Transformers under matched-compute (IsoFLOP) budgets from 10^18-10^20 FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, then analyzed relative performance gaps between test distributions rather than absolute error.

Result: Found diverse scaling trajectories: academic domains converge toward parity, regional English dialects shift based on population size, and AI risk behaviors split - capability/influence risks increase while adversarial risks don't.

Conclusion: Scaling improves overall performance but is not a universal equalizer; relative scaling laws reveal important disparities that aggregate metrics hide, helping prioritize robustness challenges.

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data,
parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on
aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over
heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce
relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test
distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error.
Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP)
budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we
find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity;
regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of
AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks
increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results
show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal
equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this
work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling
laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the
bitter lesson.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multimodal model for detecting repair initiation in Dutch dialogues using linguistic and prosodic features, showing that prosodic cues complement text and audio embeddings to improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational agents often fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to conversation breakdowns and disengagement. This work addresses the need for better OIR detection to maintain mutual understanding in human-computer conversations.

Method: Proposes a multimodal model integrating linguistic and prosodic features grounded in Conversation Analysis. Uses pretrained text and audio embeddings and examines how different features interact.

Result: Prosodic cues complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of pretrained text and audio embeddings, demonstrating effective interaction between different feature types.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach successfully detects repair initiation in Dutch dialogues. Future work should incorporate visual cues and explore multilingual/cross-context corpora to assess robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Maintaining mutual understanding is a key component in human-human
conversation to avoid conversation breakdowns, in which repair, particularly
Other-Initiated Repair (OIR, when one speaker signals trouble and prompts the
other to resolve), plays a vital role. However, Conversational Agents (CAs)
still fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to breakdowns or
disengagement. This work proposes a multimodal model to automatically detect
repair initiation in Dutch dialogues by integrating linguistic and prosodic
features grounded in Conversation Analysis. The results show that prosodic cues
complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of
pretrained text and audio embeddings, offering insights into how different
features interact. Future directions include incorporating visual cues,
exploring multilingual and cross-context corpora to assess the robustness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: OpenRM is a tool-augmented reward model that uses external tools to gather evidence for evaluating knowledge-intensive long-form responses, outperforming existing approaches and improving LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle with knowledge-intensive and long-form tasks where evaluating correctness requires external evidence beyond the model's internal knowledge, limiting their ability to discriminate subtle quality differences.

Method: Train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization on 27K synthesized pairwise examples, jointly supervising tool usage and outcome accuracy. The model invokes external tools to gather relevant evidence for judgment.

Result: OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward modeling approaches on three new datasets and two widely-used benchmarks, and improves downstream LLM alignment when integrated into inference-time response selection and training-time data selection.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented reward models like OpenRM show strong potential for scaling reliable long-form evaluation and improving LLM alignment through evidence-based judgment strategies.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models
(LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and
inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form
tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's
internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating
subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To
address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that
systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather
relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a
controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly
supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing
our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies.
Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward
modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both
inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields
consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential
of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

*Hugo Rydel-Johnston,Alex Kafkas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes dyslexic reading costs in naturalistic reading data, finding that word length, frequency, and predictability significantly impact reading times, with dyslexic readers showing stronger sensitivities to these features, especially predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and under what conditions dyslexic reading costs arise in naturalistic reading, and to quantify how word-level features influence these costs.

Method: Using eye-tracking data aligned to word-level features (word length, frequency, predictability) to model how each feature influences dyslexic time costs in a large-scale naturalistic reading dataset.

Result: All three features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, with dyslexic readers showing stronger sensitivities. Counterfactual manipulations narrowed the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability having the strongest effect.

Conclusion: The patterns align with dyslexia theories involving linguistic working memory and phonological encoding demands, and motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain remaining gaps.

Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a
large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to
word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how
each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features
robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that
dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially
predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially
narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing
the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align
with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working
memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical

### [70] [Optimizing Retrieval for RAG via Reinforced Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24652)
*Jiawei Zhou,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3 is a retrieval framework for RAG that uses reinforced contrastive learning to dynamically optimize relevance without requiring annotated data, improving RAG performance by 5.2% over original retrievers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As RAG becomes widespread, IR shifts from retrieving for humans to AI systems where relevance is difficult to predefine or annotate, requiring new approaches that don't rely on supervised data.

Method: Uses trial-and-feedback reinforced contrastive learning where retrieved results interact with the RAG environment to produce automatic contrastive signals that guide self-improvement without annotated data.

Result: Improves RAG performance by 5.2% over original retrievers, surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, and achieves comparable results to LLM-augmented systems while being efficient (4 GPUs, single-day training).

Conclusion: R3 provides an efficient and practical solution for optimizing retrieval in RAG systems through self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for annotated data while achieving competitive performance.

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for training LLMs as diagnostic agents using reinforcement learning in a virtual clinical environment, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art models in diagnostic accuracy and examination recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and commit to final diagnoses through interactive exploration rather than static case summaries.

Method: Developed DiagGym (diagnostics world model), trained DiagAgent via multi-turn reinforcement learning, and created DiagBench benchmark with physician-validated cases and rubrics.

Result: DiagAgent significantly outperformed 10 SOTA LLMs and prompt-engineered agents, achieving 9.34-15.12% higher diagnostic accuracy and 23.09-44.03% improvement in examination recommendations across different settings.

Conclusion: Learning policies in interactive clinical environments provides dynamic diagnostic management abilities that cannot be achieved through passive training alone.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

*Parker Riley,Daniel Deutsch,Mara Finkelstein,Colten DiIanni,Juraj Juraska,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MQM re-annotation, a two-stage evaluation method for machine translation that improves annotation quality by having annotators review and edit existing MQM annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As machine translation models improve, evaluation methods need to be enhanced to ensure quality gains are accurately measured and not lost in evaluation noise.

Method: Proposes MQM re-annotation where an annotator reviews and edits pre-existing MQM annotations (from themselves, other humans, or automatic systems) in a two-stage process.

Result: Rater behavior in re-annotation aligns with goals, and the method produces higher-quality annotations primarily by finding errors missed during the first pass.

Conclusion: MQM re-annotation is an effective approach to improve translation evaluation quality and better capture quality gains from improved translation models.

Abstract: Human evaluation of machine translation is in an arms race with translation
model quality: as our models get better, our evaluation methods need to be
improved to ensure that quality gains are not lost in evaluation noise. To this
end, we experiment with a two-stage version of the current state-of-the-art
translation evaluation paradigm (MQM), which we call MQM re-annotation. In this
setup, an MQM annotator reviews and edits a set of pre-existing MQM
annotations, that may have come from themselves, another human annotator, or an
automatic MQM annotation system. We demonstrate that rater behavior in
re-annotation aligns with our goals, and that re-annotation results in
higher-quality annotations, mostly due to finding errors that were missed
during the first pass.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InteractComp is a benchmark for evaluating search agents' ability to recognize ambiguous queries and interact to resolve them, revealing systematic overconfidence and stagnated interaction capabilities despite improved search performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search agents assume complete and unambiguous queries, which diverges from real-world scenarios where users start with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Existing benchmarks cannot assess this interactive capability.

Method: Constructed 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains using a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluated 17 models on their ability to recognize ambiguity and interact to resolve it.

Result: Best model achieved only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produced dramatic gains, revealing latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold.

Conclusion: InteractComp addresses a critical blind spot in search agent evaluation and provides a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities, as current strategies fail to engage latent interaction capabilities despite improved search performance.

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The

*Xun Liang,Huayi Lai,Hanyu Wang,Wentao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang,Yanfang Chen,Feiyu Xiong,Zhiyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Role prompts in medical LLMs primarily affect linguistic style rather than enhancing reasoning capabilities, with no evidence of distinct cognitive processes across clinical roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP) in medical LLMs induces genuine role-specific cognitive processes or merely modifies surface-level linguistic features.

Method: Developed the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework (RPNA) using neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques on three medical QA datasets to assess reasoning pathway changes.

Result: Role prompts do not significantly enhance medical reasoning abilities; they primarily affect linguistic features without creating distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation across clinical roles.

Conclusion: Current PBRP methods fail to replicate real-world medical cognitive complexity, highlighting the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE is a self-play reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts as both Challenger (creating tasks from corpus documents) and Reasoner (solving them), enabling continuous self-improvement through adversarial dynamics and corpus grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-improving systems need environmental interaction for continuous adaptation, and existing ungrounded self-play methods offer limited benefits.

Method: A single model acts in two roles: Challenger mines documents from large corpus to generate diverse reasoning tasks, and Reasoner solves them. Uses adversarial dynamics to create automatic curriculum at the frontier of Reasoner's capability.

Result: Achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning (+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families.

Conclusion: Document grounding is key to continuously generate increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained self-improvement.

Abstract: Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous
adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a
reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a
Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse
reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics,
the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the
Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich,
near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike
existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE
achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning
(+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how
document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its
own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained
self-improvement.

TL;DR: E-GRPO enhances LLM-based search agent training by incorporating entity-aware rewards to learn from near-miss samples, outperforming standard GRPO in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods like GRPO discard entity information and cannot distinguish informative near-miss samples from complete failures, losing valuable learning signals.

Method: Proposed Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO) with dense entity-aware reward function that assigns partial rewards based on entity match rate for incorrect samples.

Result: E-GRPO consistently outperforms GRPO baseline on QA and research benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy with more efficient reasoning policies requiring fewer tool calls.

Conclusion: E-GRPO provides a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents by leveraging entity information during training.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse
question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO
consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also
induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls,
demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search
agents.

Method: AgentFrontier Engine - an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data within LLM's ZPD, supporting both continued pre-training and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks.

Result: AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, surpassing some leading proprietary agents.

Conclusion: ZPD-guided data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their
capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data
synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve
alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the
AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality,
multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine
supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted
post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive
the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent
capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on
our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding
benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary
agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis
offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

TL;DR: WebLeaper is a framework that addresses low search efficiency in LLM-based agents by creating high-coverage information seeking tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories through tree-structured reasoning and curated Wikipedia tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current information seeking agents suffer from low search efficiency due to sparse target entities in training tasks, which limits their ability to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors.

Method: Formulates information seeking as a tree-structured reasoning problem, uses curated Wikipedia tables to synthesize three task variants (Basic, Union, Reverse-Union), and curates training trajectories that are both accurate and efficient.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks (BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, Seal-0) show consistent improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed WebLeaper framework successfully addresses search efficiency challenges in LLM-based agents and demonstrates superior performance across multiple information seeking benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative
approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a
core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While
prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe
that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn
constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is
the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities
for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these
challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS
tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a
tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of
target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated
Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic,
Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and
efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that
are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized
for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both
basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp,
GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over
strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in conventional parallel thinking approaches that repeatedly roll out from scratch and struggle to integrate long-horizon reasoning due to context limitations.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout that partitions sequences into functional regions with uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching; 2) Compressed Reasoning Aggregation that exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress relevant information for answer synthesis.

Result: Achieves up to 62% performance improvement with 10-30% reduction in exploratory token consumption across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks.

Conclusion: ParallelMuse effectively enhances problem-solving capability for deep information-seeking agents by improving exploration efficiency and enabling coherent answer generation from compressed reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep
exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance
problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two
key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from
scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories
during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full
consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose
ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first
stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences
into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and
branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed
Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress
information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final
answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks
demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in
exploratory token consumption.

TL;DR: AgentFold is a novel web agent paradigm that uses proactive context management through 'folding' operations to handle long-horizon tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off in context management for LLM-based web agents, where existing methods either suffer from context saturation or risk losing critical details through fixed summarization.

Method: Introduces AgentFold with 'folding' operations that dynamically manage historical trajectories at multiple scales - granular condensations preserve fine details while deep consolidations abstract multi-step sub-tasks.

Result: AgentFold-30B-A3B achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH, outperforming much larger models like DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B and proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.

Conclusion: AgentFold demonstrates that proactive context management through learned folding operations enables superior performance on long-horizon web tasks, even with smaller models and simple supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agent Data Protocol (ADP), a unified format for agent training data that enables standardized training across diverse datasets and frameworks, achieving ~20% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public research on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents is limited due to fragmented data across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces.

Method: Developed ADP as a light-weight representation language that serves as an interlingua between diverse agent datasets and unified training pipelines, supporting various tasks like API/tool use, browsing, coding, and software engineering.

Result: Unified 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, achieving ~20% average performance gain over base models and delivering SOTA or near-SOTA performance on coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks without domain-specific tuning.

Conclusion: ADP helps lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training by providing a unified data format that works across multiple frameworks.

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to

*Shuqing Li,Jiayi Yan,Chenyu Niu,Jen-tse Huang,Yun Peng,Wenxuan Wang,Yepang Liu,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComboBench evaluates LLMs' ability to translate semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios from 4 popular VR games, revealing that while top models show strong task decomposition, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can effectively replicate humans' intuitive ability to translate high-level semantic actions into precise VR device manipulations, which remains underexplored despite humans' natural capability based on common sense and embodied understanding.

Method: Created ComboBench benchmark with 262 scenarios from 4 VR games (Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II, Vivecraft), evaluated 7 LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, GLM-4-Flash) against ground truth and human performance.

Result: Top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition but struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples substantially improve performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for VR manipulation capabilities but still lag behind humans in procedural reasoning and spatial understanding. Targeted enhancement through few-shot learning can improve performance, indicating promising directions for future development.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples
substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted
enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities. We release all materials at

### [84] [MetricX-25 and GemSpanEval: Google Translate Submissions to the WMT25 Evaluation Shared Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24707)
*Juraj Juraska,Tobias Domhan,Mara Finkelstein,Tetsuji Nakagawa,Geza Kovacs,Daniel Deutsch,Pidong Wang,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents two new translation evaluation systems for WMT25: MetricX-25 for quality score prediction and GemSpanEval for error span detection, both built on Gemma 3 and fine-tuned on WMT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve translation evaluation by developing enhanced systems for both quality score prediction and error span detection tasks in the WMT25 shared task.

Method: Used Gemma 3 multilingual model with different architectures: encoder-only with regression head for MetricX-25 (quality scores), and decoder-only generative approach for GemSpanEval (error spans with context).

Result: MetricX-25 significantly outperforms its predecessor in predicting MQM and ESA quality scores. GemSpanEval is competitive with the strong baseline xCOMET in error span detection.

Conclusion: Both systems demonstrate effective performance in their respective tasks, with MetricX-25 showing significant improvements over previous versions and GemSpanEval achieving competitive results through generative error span detection with contextual output.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation
Evaluation Shared Task. For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a
new generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the
training protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new
model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities
and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual
open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We
demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture
with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM
and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our
decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in
error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging
baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we
instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,
thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in low-resolution imagery, with potential applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [86] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer is a transformer-based framework that uses DINOv2 foundation model for class-agnostic object counting by recognizing visual repetition and structural relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can count objects by perceiving visual repetition and structural relationships, but existing counting models struggle with complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping components. The goal is to develop a counting system that approaches human-like structural perception.

Method: Built on CounTR architecture, replaces visual encoder with self-supervised DINOv2 foundation model for richer features, incorporates positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric relationships, and uses lightweight convolutional decoder to generate density maps.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on FSC-147 dataset, with superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes.

Conclusion: Integrating foundation models like DINOv2 enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception, advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel framework using fixed cameras and deep learning for continuous monitoring of floating debris in rivers, with geometric modeling for object size estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the environmental concern of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers that impacts biodiversity, water quality, navigation, and recreation.

Method: Uses fixed in-situ cameras with deep learning models for debris detection and quantification, plus geometric modeling using camera characteristics for object size estimation.

Result: Identified optimal deep learning models for accuracy and speed under complex conditions, demonstrated feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry with regression corrections.

Conclusion: The approach enables development of robust, low-cost automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic environments, highlighting importance of dataset protocols and temporal leakage considerations.

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow is a physics-aware super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery that addresses out-of-distribution robustness through dual-conditioning architecture, uncertainty quantification, and multifaceted loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super-resolution for remote sensing imagery often fails under out-of-distribution conditions, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate results, especially for rare geomorphic features captured by diverse sensors.

Method: Uses dual-conditioning architecture with Gated ControlNet for geometric fidelity and textual prompts for semantic guidance. Introduces multifaceted loss for spectral/radiometric consistency and employs stochastic forward pass for uncertainty quantification.

Result: In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated outputs approaching ground truth fidelity, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with nearly 40% reduction in FID and qualitative superiority.

Conclusion: RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for controlled generation under severe domain shift.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for 3D scene generation using text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators, enabling scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes without scene-level datasets or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene generation methods are limited to single objects, require domain-specific training, or lack full 360-degree viewability, creating a need for more flexible and scalable approaches.

Method: Repurposes text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators, reformulating scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem with overlapping 3D regions independently generated and seamlessly blended via weighted averaging.

Result: Enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes with local semantic control, supporting diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing.

Conclusion: Establishes a simple yet powerful foundation for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction that eliminates the need for scene-level datasets or retraining while inheriting generalization capabilities from object-level priors.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [90] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP is a training-free framework that improves CLIP for semantic segmentation by exploiting visual discriminability across layers, attention heads, and tokens without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models struggle with semantic segmentation due to misalignment between image-level pre-training and pixel-level dense prediction requirements. Prior methods inherit global alignment bias, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes three techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement based on findings about layer discriminability, consistent attention heads, and token activation patterns.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 semantic segmentation benchmarks across diverse scenarios without additional training, auxiliary networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP effectively restores visual discriminability in CLIP models for segmentation tasks, demonstrating practical deployment potential through its training-free approach.

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride is a pipeline for generating coherent scene-level captions in instructional videos without manual scene segmentation, using adaptive frame sampling and multimodal reasoning to improve temporal coherence and educational value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos enhances learning by understanding visual cues and temporal structure, but current methods often fail to capture this structure, leading to incoherent captions that undermine educational intent.

Method: Uses YouCookII dataset's scene annotations with adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions. Employs multimodal chain-of-thought process to generate action-object pairs, refined with dynamic stride window selection algorithm that balances temporal context and redundancy.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines (VLLaMA3, GPT-4o) on both N-gram metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analysis shows more temporally coherent and informative captions.

Conclusion: DynaStride provides a promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation by producing more coherent and contextually rich scene-level captions.

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D is a low-latency method for novel-view synthesis of human portraits that combines image-to-3D models with diffusion models to enhance quality while maintaining 3D-awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-3D portrait models produce visual artifacts and lack detail preservation, while diffusion models generate high-quality images but lack 3D consistency and are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses a feedforward image-to-avatar pipeline to get initial 3D representation and noisy renders, then applies a single-step diffusion model conditioned on input images to refine renders with multi-view consistency. Includes pre-training on synthetic multi-view data and fine-tuning on real images.

Result: Qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for portrait novel-view synthesis while being time-efficient.

Conclusion: Image-space diffusion models can effectively enhance existing image-to-avatar methods, achieving high-quality 3D portrait synthesis with low latency and improved identity preservation.

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for indoor scenes by incorporating planar priors from vision-language segmentation and geometric supervision, achieving superior 3D surface reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with ambiguous geometry in large, low-texture indoor regions due to reliance on photometric loss alone.

Method: Uses Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) pipeline with vision-language segmentation, cross-view fusion, and adds planar consistency and geometric supervision terms to 3DGS optimization.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor benchmarks, reconstructing accurate and detailed 3D surfaces.

Conclusion: PlanarGS effectively addresses 3DGS limitations in indoor scenes through planar and geometric priors, enabling high-fidelity surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe is an adaptive training scheme for implicit neural representations that uses neuron pruning and input frequency densification to optimize network architecture during training, achieving better size-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for implicit neural representations require manual selection of input frequencies and architectures, leading to parameter redundancy and heavy hyperparameter optimization.

Method: Uses neuron pruning with targeted weight decay to transfer information from less-contributory neurons, followed by structured pruning, and then adds input frequencies to underfitting spectrum regions through densification.

Result: Experiments on images and SDFs show AIRe reduces model size while preserving or improving reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AIRe provides an effective adaptive training approach that automatically refines INR architectures during optimization, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter tuning while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural USD introduces a hierarchical scene representation framework inspired by Universal Scene Descriptor (USD) to enable precise, iterative object editing in generative models while preventing unintended global changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current controllable generative models struggle with precise object editing, often causing unintended global changes when trying to modify specific elements like object color or background while keeping other elements unchanged.

Method: Proposes Neural USD framework with structured hierarchical scene representation, accommodating diverse signals with minimal model constraints, and applies fine-tuning to disentangle control signals for appearance, geometry, and pose.

Result: The framework enables iterative and incremental workflows with per-object control over appearance, geometry, and pose, demonstrating effective design considerations.

Conclusion: Neural USD successfully addresses challenges in precise object editing by providing a structured hierarchical representation that prevents unintended global changes and enables fine-grained control.

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

*Peiyang Xu,Minzhou Pan,Zhaorun Chen,Shuang Yang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision is a novel image guardrail system that integrates human-like reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency in detecting unsafe content, outperforming existing models like GPT-4o while being significantly faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image guardrail models have limitations including misclassification due to lack of semantic reasoning, inability to adapt to emerging threats without costly retraining, and lack of transparency in decision-making.

Method: SafeVision incorporates an effective data collection and generation framework, policy-following training pipeline, customized loss function, and diverse QA generation strategy. It dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time without requiring retraining.

Result: SafeVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and 15.5% on VisionHarm-C benchmarks while being over 16x faster. The authors also introduced VisionHarm, a comprehensive dataset spanning diverse harmful categories.

Conclusion: SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and explainable image guardrail system with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats, addressing key limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

*Andriy Myronenko,Dong Yang,Baris Turkbey,Mariam Aboian,Sena Azamat,Esra Akcicek,Hongxu Yin,Pavlo Molchanov,Marc Edgar,Yufan He,Pengfei Guo,Yucheng Tang,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that brings chain-of-thought reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation, enabling transparent stepwise reasoning similar to clinicians' thought processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most vision-language models for medical imaging are opaque and lack the transparent, stepwise reasoning that clinicians rely on for diagnosis and decision-making.

Method: Couples high-fidelity visual encoding with two-stage training: reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards over X-ray abnormalities.

Result: Achieves competitive multi-label classification in out-of-distribution evaluation while improving interpretability. In reader studies, reasoning traces increased radiologist confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced report finalization time.

Conclusion: The approach enables trustworthy, explainable AI in medical imaging where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality, supporting safer human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

TL;DR: Proposes joint prediction of multiple Fourier components for better quality and efficiency in arbitrary-scale super-resolution, addressing limitations of existing recurrent neural network approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using recurrent neural networks, leading to performance degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction.

Method: Predicting multiple Fourier components jointly rather than sequentially one by one.

Result: Improves both quality and efficiency in arbitrary-scale super-resolution.

Conclusion: Joint prediction of multiple Fourier components is more effective than sequential independent prediction for cost-and-quality controllable super-resolution.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a
recurrent neural network. However, this approach leads to performance

Result: Developed a benchmark with 3,291 human-verified QA items spanning multiple question formats, evaluated strictly in streaming settings. Proposed two key metrics: Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time to assess correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention.

Conclusion: TeleEgo provides a realistic and comprehensive evaluation framework to advance the development of practical AI assistants capable of processing multi-modal inputs, responding in real time, and retaining evolving long-term memory in real-world settings.

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

TL;DR: Proposes AdvBlur, a novel diabetic retinopathy classification method that uses adversarial blurred images and dual-loss functions to improve domain generalization across different datasets and imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy detection struggle with robustness due to distributional variations from different acquisition devices, demographics, and imaging conditions.

Method: Integrates adversarial blurred images into the dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain generalization challenges.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on unseen external datasets, with comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: AdvBlur effectively mitigates the impact of unseen distributional variations in diabetic retinopathy classification, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

TL;DR: Mars-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating foundation models on Mars science tasks, comprising 20 datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection of geologic features, with results suggesting domain-specific models outperform general ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have shown strong generalization in many domains, but their application to Mars science is limited due to the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks, hindering progress in developing Mars-specific foundation models.

Method: Created Mars-Bench benchmark with 20 standardized datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks focused on key Martian geologic features. Provided baseline evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Result: Results from all analyses indicate that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, suggesting domain-adapted pre-training could be beneficial for Mars science applications.

Conclusion: Mars-Bench establishes a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science, with data, models, and code made publicly available to facilitate future research in this domain.

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.

TL;DR: APT is a black-box framework that uses LLMs to generate human-readable adversarial prompts that bypass safety filters in text-to-image models, achieving superior red-teaming performance and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current red-teaming methods for T2I models require white-box access, use inefficient per-prompt optimization, and generate meaningless prompts that are easily blocked by filters.

Method: Uses alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and LLM fine-tuning, with dual-evasion strategy using perplexity scoring and banned-token penalties to bypass filters.

Result: Generates human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts with excellent red-teaming performance and superior zero-shot transferability to unseen prompts and commercial APIs.

Conclusion: APT effectively exposes critical vulnerabilities in T2I models, including commercial APIs, through human-readable adversarial prompts that evade safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the vanishing gradient problem that makes training very deep convolutional neural networks challenging.

Method: Uses residual blocks with skip connections that allow gradients to flow directly through shortcut connections, bypassing intermediate layers.

Result: On CIFAR-10, ResNet-18 achieved 89.9% accuracy vs 84.1% for traditional deep CNN of similar depth, with faster convergence and more stable training.

Conclusion: Residual Networks successfully enable training of very deep networks by addressing gradient flow issues through skip connections.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Shuhui Wang,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNELLA is a one-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses nonlinear kernel functions and adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation to achieve state-of-the-art performance with low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods have limitations: two-stage approaches overlook parameter adjustments during fine-tuning, and sparse gradient masking causes high memory usage due to storing all weight matrices in the optimizer.

Method: SNELLA uses selective weight updates via sparse matrices merged from two low-rank learnable matrices with nonlinear kernel functions. It employs adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation that allows weights to compete across and inside layers based on importance scores in an end-to-end manner.

Result: SNELLA achieves 1.8% higher Top-1 accuracy (91.9% vs 90.1%) on FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA, and reduces memory usage by 31.1%-39.9% across models with 86M to 632M parameters.

Conclusion: SNELLA overcomes limitations of existing PEFT methods by providing a one-stage approach that achieves superior performance with significantly reduced memory consumption across various vision tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

*Xingyu Zhu,Beier Zhu,Shuo Wang,Kesen Zhao,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLA is a training-free framework that uses optimal transport to align adversarial image and text features in CLIP models, improving robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining clean sample accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models show strong zero-shot classification but are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations due to misalignment between image and text features, which worsens under attacks.

Method: COLA projects adversarial image embeddings onto class text feature subspace to filter distortions, then uses optimal transport to align images and texts as discrete distributions over augmented views.

Result: COLA achieves average 6.7% improvement on ImageNet and variants under PGD attacks across 14 benchmarks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.

Conclusion: The proposed COLA framework effectively addresses adversarial misalignment in CLIP models through optimal transport-based cross-modality alignment without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOB is a fine-tuning strategy for T2I models that extracts class-agnostic attributes (background, pose) from real examples, conditions on them during fine-tuning, and marginalizes them out during generation to improve synthetic data quality for fine-grained classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning T2I models with few real examples for synthetic dataset generation often causes overfitting and reduces diversity, limiting effectiveness for classification tasks.

Method: Extract class-agnostic attributes from real examples, explicitly condition T2I model fine-tuning on these attributes, then marginalize them out during synthetic data generation to preserve generative prior and reduce overfitting.

Result: BOB achieves SOTA performance in low-shot fine-grained classification, outperforming DataDream by 7.4% on Aircraft dataset and beating prior art in 18 of 24 experimental settings, with 2+% improvements in 14 settings.

Conclusion: BOB effectively mitigates overfitting in T2I fine-tuning, preserves model diversity, and enables high-quality synthetic data generation that outperforms using more real images in many cases.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniText is a training-free generalist framework for Text Image Manipulation (TIM) that addresses limitations of existing text inpainting methods by enabling text removal, style control, and preventing duplicated letters through self-attention inversion and cross-attention redistribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text inpainting methods have three key limitations: inability to remove text, lack of style control over rendered text, and tendency to generate duplicated letters, which hinders their applicability to broader TIM tasks.

Method: Proposes OmniText using cross- and self-attention mechanisms: self-attention inversion for text removal to reduce hallucinations, cross-attention redistribution to reduce text hallucination, and a latent optimization framework with cross-attention content loss and self-attention style loss for controllable inpainting.

Result: OmniText achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple TIM tasks and metrics, comparable with specialist methods. Also introduces OmniText-Bench benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks.

Conclusion: OmniText is the first generalist method capable of performing diverse TIM tasks including text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion/editing with various styles, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

*Shufan Shen,Zhaobo Qi,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Qi Tian,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper discovers a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability in pre-trained visual representations, proposes an Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) to quantify interpretability, and shows that optimizing for interpretability can improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread applications of pre-trained visual models require both high classifiability and interpretability, but it was unclear whether these two properties could be achieved simultaneously.

Method: Proposed Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates information loss when interpreting representations, measuring the ratio of interpretable semantics. Used this to quantify representation interpretability and analyze its relationship with classifiability.

Result: Discovered positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability - representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable semantics. Showed that fine-tuning with interpretability maximization can further improve classifiability, and predictions based on interpretations have less accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: Practitioners can unify improvements in both interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models, as these properties are positively correlated rather than conflicting objectives.

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes

### [110] [UHKD: A Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation via Frequency-Domain Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24116)
*Fengming Yu,Haiwei Pan,Kejia Zhang,Jian Guan,Haiying Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UHKD is a knowledge distillation framework that uses frequency domain transformations to enable effective knowledge transfer between heterogeneous teacher-student model architectures, overcoming semantic discrepancies in intermediate features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods work well for homogeneous models but degrade in heterogeneous scenarios due to architectural differences causing semantic discrepancies in intermediate representations. Most methods focus only on logits space, underutilizing semantic information in intermediate layers.

Method: Proposes UHKD framework using Fourier transform to capture global feature information in frequency domain. Includes Feature Transformation Module (FTM) for compact frequency-domain teacher representations and Feature Alignment Module (FAM) for projecting and aligning student features via multi-level matching. Uses joint objective combining MSE on intermediate features with KL divergence on logits.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K show performance gains of 5.59% and 0.83% respectively over the latest methods, demonstrating effectiveness in unifying heterogeneous representations.

Conclusion: UHKD effectively addresses the challenge of knowledge distillation between heterogeneous architectures by leveraging frequency domain transformations, enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge across different model structures.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETC is a training-free diffusion acceleration framework that uses trend consistency prediction and model-specific error tolerance search to achieve 2.65x speedup over FLUX with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free diffusion acceleration methods ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance, causing trajectory deviations and result inconsistencies under multi-step reuse.

Method: ETC introduces (1) consistent trend predictor that projects historical denoising patterns into stable future directions across multiple steps, and (2) model-specific error tolerance search that identifies transition points from semantic planning to quality refinement to derive corrective thresholds.

Result: ETC achieves 2.65x acceleration over FLUX with negligible degradation (-0.074 SSIM score) in consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed ETC framework effectively accelerates diffusion models while maintaining generation quality through trend consistency and adaptive error control mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Result: Achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models while preserving aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves layout faithfulness in text-to-image generation through explicit layout-grounding and self-refinement techniques.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Motivation: To enhance Vision-Language Models' performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks by addressing the challenge of diverse question types and improving spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Four-component framework: 1) Mixture-of-Prompts router for question classification, 2) Task-specific prompts with coordinate systems, spatial reasoning, and reasoning chains, 3) Visual assembly module for multi-view image composition, 4) Optimized inference parameters per task.

Result: Achieved 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data) using Qwen2.5-VL-72B model, demonstrating substantial performance improvement on autonomous driving tasks.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and spatial grounding significantly enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks, with the proposed framework showing robust performance across both clean and corrupted data scenarios.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption

dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAP-SAM2 is the first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 that addresses architectural differences from SAM through target-scanning strategy and dual semantic deviation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's robustness remains unexplored despite its strong video segmentation capabilities, and existing SAM attacks may not transfer effectively due to architectural differences involving prompt guidance and semantic entanglement across frames.

Method: Proposes UAP-SAM2 with target-scanning strategy (dividing frames into regions with random prompts) and dual semantic deviation framework that distorts intra-frame semantics and disrupts inter-frame semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks show UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks by a large margin.

Conclusion: The proposed UAP-SAM2 effectively addresses the unique challenges in attacking SAM2 and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-SJD is a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework that accelerates autoregressive visual generation by improving token stability across iterations, achieving up to 4.2x speedup in image generation and 13.3x in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive modeling for visual generation suffers from slow inference speed due to per-token generation requiring thousands of steps, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Extends Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD) with an information-theoretic coupling approach that maximizes probability of sampling identical draft tokens across iterations while preserving lossless property.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains with only single-line modification to existing algorithm: ~4.2x acceleration in image generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, with no degradation in output quality.

Conclusion: MC-SJD provides an efficient solution to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while maintaining lossless decoding, making AR models more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ID²Face is a training-centric face anonymization framework that learns a disentangled latent space to separate identity from non-identity attributes, enabling direct anonymization without inference-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based anonymization methods rely on inference-time interventions that cause distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity attributes, degrading visual quality and utility.

Method: Uses a conditional diffusion model with identity-masked learning, Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer with Identity VAE, bidirectional latent alignment, and Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer with soft-gating. Includes Orthogonal Identity Mapping for inference.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and utility preservation.

Conclusion: ID²Face provides effective face anonymization through explicit disentanglement of identity and non-identity attributes in a structured latent space, eliminating the need for inference-time optimization.

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a novel visual token pruning method for MLLMs that jointly considers saliency and coverage to preserve semantic completeness while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods focus only on saliency, leading to semantic incompleteness in selected tokens, while many visual tokens in MLLMs are redundant.

Method: Proposes SCOPE score that integrates saliency with token-coverage gain, iteratively selecting tokens with highest SCOPE score based on set-coverage computed from token relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language benchmarks using LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next show consistent outperformance over prior approaches.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively reduces computational overhead while better preserving semantic completeness through joint modeling of saliency and coverage in visual token pruning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional microsaccade studies use expensive eye trackers with limited scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a high-speed, low-latency alternative for studying small eye movements.

Method: Used Blender to render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios with microsaccades (0.5-2.0 degrees angular displacement) across 7 classes, converted to event streams using v2e. Evaluated with Spiking-VGG models and proposed Spiking-VGG16Flow with optical flow enhancement.

Result: Models achieved around 90% average accuracy in classifying microsaccades by angular displacement, independent of event count or duration.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion recognition and establishes a benchmark for event-based vision research. Dataset, code, and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The

*Qing Zhao,Weijian Deng,Pengxu Wei,ZiYi Dong,Hannan Lu,Xiangyang Ji,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD) to address the functional mismatch between image restoration and detection networks, improving detection robustness in adverse conditions like haze and low light.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cascade frameworks that apply image restoration as pre-processing for object detection suffer from functional mismatch, where restoration networks perform smooth transformations while detectors have discontinuous decision boundaries, causing instability and sensitivity to minor perturbations.

Method: The authors analyze the functional differences through Lipschitz continuity and propose LROD framework that integrates image restoration directly into detector's feature learning. They implement this as LR-YOLO, which harmonizes Lipschitz continuity of both tasks during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks show that LR-YOLO consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy compared to traditional cascade approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Lipschitz-regularized framework effectively addresses the functional mismatch between restoration and detection networks, providing a more stable and accurate solution for object detection in adverse conditions.

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Method: Uses Mamba's selective state space model for global context propagation, adds CrossGate for shadow-aware similarity modulation, and ColorShift regularization for contrastive learning with global color statistics to suppress color contamination.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative performance on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively adapts sequence modeling to maintain structural integrity and chromatic consistency in shadow removal tasks.

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

*Jiyu Guo,Shuo Yang,Yiming Huang,Yancheng Long,Xiaobo Xia,Xiu Su,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UtilGen is a utility-centric data augmentation framework that optimizes synthetic data generation using downstream task feedback to produce task-specific, high-utility training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data augmentation approaches focus on visual quality metrics like fidelity and diversity but neglect task-specific requirements, which vary significantly across different tasks and network architectures.

Method: UtilGen uses a weight allocation network to evaluate task-specific utility of synthetic samples, then iteratively refines data generation through dual-level optimization: model-level optimization (tailoring generative model to downstream task) and instance-level optimization (adjusting generation policies like prompt embeddings and initial noise).

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show UtilGen achieves superior performance with average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over previous state-of-the-art methods, producing more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data.

Conclusion: UtilGen validates the effectiveness of shifting from visual characteristics-centric to task utility-centric data augmentation, demonstrating that task-specific utility optimization leads to better performance than traditional visual quality-focused approaches.

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free one-shot attribution method using image resynthesis outperforms existing techniques in synthetic image source attribution under data scarcity conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic image source attribution is challenging in data scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification capabilities.

Method: Training-free one-shot attribution based on image resynthesis: generate a prompt describing the image, resynthesize it with all candidate sources, and attribute to the model producing the closest resynthesis in feature space.

Result: The proposed resynthesis method outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and other baselines when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The new dataset provides a challenging attribution framework and represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot and zero-shot methods.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPER is a self-bootstrapping framework that enhances fine-grained visual perception in VLMs through a coarse-to-fine progressive learning process using self-critiquing and self-prediction, achieving significant performance gains while maintaining generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical bottleneck of limited fine-grained visual perception in Vision-Language Models, which is challenging due to data scarcity and limitations of existing methods like SFT (compromises general capabilities) and RFT (prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception).

Method: Proposes a two-stage task structuring visual perception as coarse-to-fine progressive process. Develops ViPER framework with self-bootstrapping through self-critiquing and self-prediction. Integrates image-level and instance-level reconstruction with two-stage reinforcement learning strategy to create closed-loop training paradigm using internally synthesized data.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL family, produces Qwen-Viper series with average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception. Consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability.

Conclusion: ViPER enables self-improvement in perceptual capabilities and provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, representing a breakthrough for developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt learning methods outperform zero-shot CLIP and linear probing for few-shot remote sensing scene classification, with Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints showing the most robust cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the domain gap between general vision-language models like CLIP and remote sensing imagery, and overcome the scarcity of labeled data and high annotation costs in remote sensing applications.

Method: Systematically evaluate four prompt learning methods (Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints) against two baselines (zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and linear probe on frozen CLIP features) for few-shot remote sensing scene classification.

Result: Prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios across multiple benchmark datasets, with Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieving the most robust cross-domain generalization performance.

Conclusion: Prompt learning provides a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, offering a strong foundation for future research in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Motivation: Teacher-student frameworks in semi-supervised medical image segmentation are limited by strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer between teacher and student networks.

Method: Introduces a switching Dual-Student architecture that selects the most reliable student at each iteration, and a Loss-Aware Exponential Moving Average strategy to dynamically ensure the teacher absorbs meaningful information from students.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods on 3D medical image segmentation datasets, improving segmentation accuracy under limited supervision.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher
and student networks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel
switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised

*Yuda Zou,Zijian Zhang,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: W2-Net addresses the overlooked challenge in Referring Expression Counting by decoupling the problem into "what to count" and "where to see" using dual queries, significantly improving counting accuracy and localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current REC methods focus on class-level features due to annotation points being placed on class-representative locations, neglecting attribute information from other visual regions needed for fine-grained subclass discrimination.

Method: Proposes W2-Net with dual-query mechanism: what-to-count queries for object localization and where-to-see queries for attribute-specific feature extraction, plus Subclass Separable Matching with repulsive force for better inter-subclass separation.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on REC-8K dataset: 22.5% counting error reduction (validation), 18.0% (test), and 7-8% improvement in localization F1 scores.

Conclusion: W2-Net effectively addresses the fundamental challenge in REC by explicitly separating object localization from attribute feature extraction, achieving substantial performance improvements through its dual-query framework and novel matching strategy.

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

TL;DR: StrokeSeg is a lightweight, modular framework that converts research-grade stroke lesion segmentation models into deployable clinical applications with equivalent performance to original PyTorch pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning frameworks like nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance but are difficult to deploy clinically due to heavy dependencies and monolithic design.

Method: Decouples preprocessing (using Anima toolbox with BIDS-compliant outputs), inference (using ONNX Runtime with Float16 quantization reducing model size by 50%), and postprocessing. Provides both GUI and CLI interfaces distributed as Python scripts and standalone Windows executable.

Result: On 300 sub-acute and chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference <10^-3).

Conclusion: High-performing research pipelines can be successfully transformed into portable, clinically usable tools without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MLSN, a luminance-aware multi-scale network for polarization image fusion that addresses contrast differences in polarized images and adapts to complex lighting through brightness-aware modules and global-local feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface properties, but faces challenges with inherent contrast differences in polarized images and complex luminance environments that affect texture feature integration.

Method: Uses multi-scale spatial weight matrix with brightness-branch for dynamic luminance injection, global-local feature fusion with windowed self-attention, and Brightness-Enhancement module for nonlinear luminance correction. Also introduces MSP dataset with 1000 polarized image pairs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets with MS-SSIM and SD metrics higher than average by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31% respectively.

Conclusion: MLSN effectively addresses polarization image fusion challenges in complex lighting, with proposed brightness-aware modules and new dataset advancing the field. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

*Herman Bergström,Zhongqi Yue,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies when and how radiology reports can improve medical image classification, finding that text-based pre-training helps when labels are well-represented in text, but can be detrimental otherwise, while fine-tuning with reports often provides significant benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images often come with radiology reports containing expert annotations, but using these reports requires manual radiologist work. The research aims to determine when radiology reports can improve image-only classification, addressing gaps in prior work that focused only on diagnostic labels extracted from reports.

Method: Conducted systematic study of using radiology reports during both pre-training and fine-tuning phases, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g., 12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes.

Result: Found that: (1) Report-based pre-training helps when labels are well-represented in text but can be detrimental otherwise; (2) Fine-tuning with reports leads to significant improvements and can have larger impact than pre-training method in some settings.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for leveraging privileged text data to train medical image classifiers while highlighting current research gaps in this area.

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

TL;DR: REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, detects both focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke MRI better when trained on healthy controls rather than stroke patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-stroke MRI shows structural changes beyond focal lesions that are poorly captured by supervised methods. These abnormalities are important biomarkers for recovery but current methods don't detect them well.

Method: Used REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised anomaly detection. Trained two models: one on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and one on healthy controls (IXI). Evaluated with dual-expert annotations and Free-Response ROC analysis.

Result: The IXI-trained model performed better: lesion segmentation Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27, and improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).

Conclusion: Training on fully healthy anatomy improves modeling of normal variability, enabling more reliable detection of structural abnormalities in post-stroke patients.

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Motivation: To address challenges in multi-object tracking including unknown/time-varying target numbers, ID consistency maintenance, nonlinear dynamics handling, and robust tracking with weak/noisy detectors.

Method: Hybrid tracking combining stochastic and deterministic approaches, PSO with fitness measures, social interactions among targets, comprehensive state/observation model with space consistency, appearance, detection confidence, track penalties, and social scores.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A visual multi-object tracking method combining stochastic particle filtering with deterministic association for consistent target identification under nonlinear dynamics and varying target counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address identifier consistency challenges in multi-object tracking with unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics, where traditional methods struggle with maintaining track identities during interactions and occlusions.

Method: Joint stochastic-deterministic approach: particle filter with PSO optimization for nonlinear dynamics, deterministic association with cost matrix considering spatial consistency, detection confidence, and track penalties, plus velocity regression for trend-seed velocities and smooth state updates.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with flexible operation for both pre-recorded videos and live camera streams.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively maintains identifier consistency in challenging tracking scenarios with nonlinear dynamics and varying target numbers, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method
and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub:

water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

*Reem Hammoud,Abdul karim Gizzini,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive evaluation framework for explainable AI in semantic segmentation that addresses spatial and contextual complexities using pixel-level metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for transparent and trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains, coupled with the lack of specialized evaluation strategies for semantic segmentation in XAI.

Method: Developed a systematic evaluation framework with pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics specifically for semantic segmentation XAI methods.

Result: Simulation results using CAM-based XAI schemes demonstrated the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology.

Conclusion: The framework advances transparent, trustworthy, and accountable semantic segmentation models by providing rigorous evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

### [138] [Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via Self-Generated Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24437)
*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCIC-sgp is a learned image compression framework that uses self-generated priors to separate structural information from texture details, achieving better rate-distortion performance and reducing geometric deformation at low bitrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned image compression methods struggle with modeling complex correlation structures in natural images, particularly the entanglement of global structures and local textures, leading to geometric deformation at low bitrates.

Method: The framework uses functional decomposition with self-generated priors to encode structural backbone first, then deeply conditions the entire compression pipeline (especially analysis transform) to focus on residual high-entropy details, achieving hierarchical information disentanglement.

Result: Significantly mitigates geometric deformation artifacts at low bitrates and achieves BD-rate reductions of 14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against VVC test model VTM-12.1 on Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The deeply-conditioned approach with self-generated priors effectively disentangles information streams and establishes highly competitive performance in learned image compression.

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) show better data efficiency and compositional understanding in visual tasks compared to Large Language Models (LLMs), suggesting video pretraining provides strong inductive biases for visual foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have succeeded in language tasks with little supervision, but this success hasn't translated to the visual domain where models struggle with compositional understanding and sample efficiency.

Method: Compare pretrained LLMs and VDMs equipped with lightweight adapters on various benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata.

Result: VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than LLMs across all tested benchmarks, showing better adaptation to visual tasks.

Conclusion: Video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models, bridging the gap between language and visual domain capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

*Charles Javerliat,Pierre Raimbaud,Guillaume Lavoué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo is a calibration-free pipeline for markerless motion capture from unsynchronized, uncalibrated consumer RGB cameras that simultaneously calibrates cameras and reconstructs 3D keypoints at metric scale with significant accuracy improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration-free motion capture approaches suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction accuracy, limiting accessibility for non-experts and in-the-wild captures.

Method: Leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf detectors with confidence-driven spatio-temporal sampling and graph-based global optimization to simultaneously calibrate cameras (including distortion coefficients) and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point maps.

Result: Reduces camera translation error by 83-85%, camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error by 83-91% compared to prior state-of-the-art methods on EgoHumans and Human3.6M datasets.

Conclusion: Kineo provides an efficient, fully automatic calibration-free solution that processes multi-view sequences faster than their duration in some configurations, making markerless motion capture more accessible for practical applications.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly

*Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled MeanFlow converts pretrained flow models into flow map models without architectural changes, enabling high-quality image generation in 1-4 steps with over 100x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Denoising generative models require many steps due to discretization error, and existing flow map approaches need architectural modifications that limit compatibility with pretrained models.

Method: A decoding strategy that conditions final blocks of diffusion transformers on subsequent timesteps, combined with enhanced training techniques, to convert flow models into flow maps without architectural changes.

Result: Achieved 1-step FID of 2.16 on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.12 on 512x512, surpassing prior art. With 4 steps, achieved FID of 1.51 and 1.68, nearly matching flow model performance.

Conclusion: Training flow models first and then converting them to flow maps is more efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch, enabling fast high-quality generation with minimal architectural overhead.

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuralRTI improves reflectance field modeling over traditional methods but is computationally expensive. DisK-NeuralRTI uses knowledge distillation to reduce computational costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RTI methods like PTM and HSH have limitations in capturing complex reflectance fields with few coefficients, while NeuralRTI provides superior quality but is computationally expensive for interactive relighting on limited hardware.

Method: Proposes DisK-NeuralRTI using Knowledge Distillation to reduce computational costs of NeuralRTI by training smaller networks that maintain quality through distillation from larger networks.

Result: The method successfully reduces computational costs while preserving the superior quality of NeuralRTI, making it feasible for interactive relighting on limited hardware.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation enables efficient NeuralRTI implementation without sacrificing quality, addressing the computational limitations of the original approach.

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

TL;DR: Latent Sketchpad equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad for generative visual thinking, enabling them to interleave textual reasoning with visual latent generation for improved planning and imagination in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at visual understanding but struggle with visual planning and imagination. Humans use sketching as visual thinking to develop ideas, inspiring the need for similar capabilities in AI models.

Method: Integrates visual generation into MLLMs' autoregressive reasoning process using two components: Context-Aware Vision Head for producing visual representations and pretrained Sketch Decoder for rendering interpretable images.

Result: Latent Sketchpad achieves comparable or superior reasoning performance to backbone MLLMs on the MazePlanning dataset, generalizing across different models like Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: The framework extends MLLMs' textual reasoning to visual thinking, opening opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications in complex visual scenarios.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in real-world computer environments, addressing the gap in fair assessment of tool usage capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past evaluations focused mainly on GUI interaction skills while overlooking tool invocation abilities enabled by Model Context Protocol (MCP), creating unfair comparisons between agents with integrated tool invocation and those evaluated only on GUI interaction.

Method: Created a novel automated code-generation pipeline to build tools and combined them with curated existing tools, resulting in 158 high-quality tools across 7 common applications that were manually validated for functionality, applicability, and versatility.

Result: MCP tools improved task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet), but even top models had low tool invocation rates (only 36.3%), indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP sets a new standard for evaluating multimodal agents in complex, tool-assisted environments by explicitly measuring MCP tool usage skills, providing deeper understanding of agent capabilities and highlighting the importance of assessing tool invocation.

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents

*Xu Jiang,Huiying Pan,Ligen Shi,Jianing Sun,Wenfeng Xu,Xing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning method using Gaussian RBF and KAN networks to correct scatter artifacts in CBCT by modeling rotational symmetry of scatter distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT suffers from scatter artifacts that cause CT value bias and reduced tissue contrast, degrading diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Uses Gaussian RBF to model point scatter function and embeds it into KAN layers to learn high-dimensional scatter features, incorporating physical prior knowledge of rotational symmetry.

Result: Effectively corrects scatter artifacts in reconstructed images and outperforms current methods in quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines physical scatter characteristics with KAN's function mapping capability for improved CBCT scatter correction.

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

TL;DR: A dual-branch CNN for face forgery detection that combines spatial and frequency domain features with adaptive fusion and a unified loss function, achieving strong performance across multiple forgery types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables creation of highly realistic forged facial images, posing threats to AI security, digital media integrity, and public trust, requiring robust detection methods.

Method: Dual-branch CNN with RGB branch for semantic information and frequency branch for high-frequency artifacts, using channel attention for feature fusion and FSC Loss (focal loss + supervised contrastive loss + frequency center margin loss).

Result: Achieves strong performance across all forgery categories on DiFF benchmark (text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, face edit) and outperforms average human accuracy.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates effectiveness and potential contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks through its robust multi-domain approach.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists' diagnostic accuracy averages only 70% with poor inter-observer consistency, and there's a lack of behavioral data to understand diagnostic errors and inconsistencies in whole-slide image interpretation.

Method: Collected 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data (EMSVD) from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 whole-slide images using an ecologically valid testbed called PTAH.

Result: Recorded 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events, creating a comprehensive behavioral dataset for studying diagnostic workflows.

Conclusion: This dataset can help explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies, and could be used to improve training for both pathologists and AI systems supporting human experts.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In
addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Group Relative Attention Guidance (GRAG) for fine-grained control over image editing intensity in Diffusion-in-Transformer models by reweighting attention delta values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods lack effective control over editing degree, limiting customization capabilities.

Method: Analyzes MM-Attention mechanism in DiT models, identifies bias vectors as inherent editing behavior, and reweights delta values between tokens and biases to modulate focus on input vs editing instruction.

Result: GRAG enables continuous fine-grained control over editing intensity without tuning, improves editing quality, and provides smoother/more precise control than Classifier-Free Guidance.

Conclusion: GRAG is a simple yet effective method that can be integrated with minimal code to enhance editing control and quality in existing frameworks.

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image

*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a zero-shot structure-aware generative video transition method that combines structural guidance with generative synthesis to create smooth, semantically consistent transitions between diverse video clips without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video transition methods struggle with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant semantic differences, creating a need for content-aware and visually coherent transitions that preserve structure and perceptual continuity.

Method: Proposes SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) that combines structural guidance via line maps and motion flow with generative synthesis, drawing inspiration from artistic workflows like aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient features.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines (FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI) on quantitative metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips.

Conclusion: SAGE provides an effective zero-shot approach for generating smooth, semantically consistent video transitions that bridge diverse clips with large temporal or semantic gaps, outperforming current alternatives.

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

*Yun Zhang,Zhaoliang Zheng,Johnson Liu,Zhiyu Huang,Zewei Zhou,Zonglin Meng,Tianhui Cai,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIC-BEV is a Transformer-based BEV perception framework for infrastructure-based multi-camera 3D object detection that handles variable cameras with heterogeneous parameters and shows strong robustness under sensor degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based detection models underperform in infrastructure-based perception due to multi-view setups, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs, and various road layouts.

Method: Uses Transformer-based BEV framework with graph-enhanced fusion module that integrates multi-view image features into BEV space using geometric relationships between cameras and BEV cells alongside latent visual cues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection on both synthetic M2I dataset and real-world RoScenes dataset, remaining robust under extreme weather and sensor degradation.

Conclusion: MIC-BEV demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in intelligent transportation systems with infrastructure-based perception.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [152] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers naturally develop object binding capabilities through self-supervised pretraining, representing whether image patches belong to the same object (IsSameObject) with over 90% accuracy, which actively guides attention and serves the learning objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether object binding - the ability to group features into coherent objects - naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers, challenging the assumption that explicit object-centric attention mechanisms are necessary.

Method: Used similarity probes to decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers, comparing self-supervised models (DINO, MAE, CLIP) with ImageNet-supervised models, and conducted ablation studies to test the functional role of this capability.

Result: Object binding emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs with over 90% accuracy, but is markedly weaker in supervised models. IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace and actively guides attention, with ablation degrading downstream performance.

Conclusion: Symbolic knowledge of object binding naturally emerges in connectionist systems like ViTs through specific pretraining objectives, serving the learning objective and challenging views that ViTs lack object binding capabilities.

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMoE is a Mixture-of-Experts framework for Diffusion Transformers that addresses the limitations of applying MoE to vision tasks through a two-step router with explicit routing guidance, improving expert specialization for visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion Transformers have yielded limited gains due to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens - visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity that hinder expert specialization.

Method: ProMoE uses a two-step router with explicit routing guidance: conditional routing partitions tokens into conditional/unconditional sets based on functional roles, and prototypical routing refines assignments of conditional tokens using learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Also includes routing contrastive loss for intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark show that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed explicit semantic guidance through prototypical routing and routing contrastive loss is crucial for vision MoE, enabling effective expert specialization in Diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: URSA is a discrete generative modeling framework for video generation that uses iterative global refinement of spatiotemporal tokens with Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting, achieving performance comparable to continuous diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete approaches for video generation lag behind continuous-space methods due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency issues.

Method: URSA formulates video generation as iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens, integrating Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanisms, plus asynchronous temporal fine-tuning for unified tasks.

Result: URSA outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods on challenging video and image generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: URSA successfully bridges the gap between discrete and continuous approaches for scalable video generation, enabling efficient high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation with fewer inference steps.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

*Chonghyuk Song,Michal Stary,Boyuan Chen,George Kopanas,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative View Stitching (GVS) enables stable, collision-free camera-guided video generation by sampling entire sequences in parallel and using a novel stitching algorithm compatible with off-the-shelf video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models cannot use future conditioning, leading to collisions with generated scenes when following predefined camera trajectories, causing the generation to collapse.

Method: Proposes GVS sampling algorithm that extends diffusion stitching from robot planning to video generation, works with any Diffusion Forcing-trained model, and introduces Omni Guidance for temporal consistency and loop-closing mechanisms.

Result: GVS achieves stable, collision-free camera-guided video generation that is frame-to-frame consistent and closes loops for various predefined camera paths, including impossible geometries like the Impossible Staircase.

Conclusion: GVS successfully addresses the limitations of autoregressive models by enabling parallel sampling with future conditioning, delivering coherent long-range video generation that faithfully follows complex camera trajectories.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

### [156] [Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807)
*Hamid R. Tizhoosh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current pathology foundation models fail to deliver expected breakthroughs due to fundamental conceptual mismatches with tissue complexity, exhibiting low accuracy, poor robustness, and safety vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why foundation models that revolutionized other domains are underperforming in computational pathology despite high expectations for cancer diagnosis and prognostication.

Method: Systematic evaluation and analysis of pathology foundation models to identify root causes of their shortcomings through examination of seven interrelated factors.

Result: Identified seven key causes: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and fundamental design flaw in tissue patch size.

Conclusion: Current pathology foundation models are conceptually misaligned with tissue morphology and require fundamental paradigm rethinking rather than incremental improvements.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

TL;DR: MobileRisk-Live is a dynamic sandbox environment with safety detection benchmark for mobile agents, and OS-Sentinel is a hybrid framework combining formal verification and VLM-based contextual judgment to detect safety risks in mobile agent operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Model agents show promise for digital automation but pose safety risks like system compromise and privacy leakage. Current methods struggle to detect these risks across complex mobile environments.

Method: Proposed OS-Sentinel framework with two components: Formal Verifier for system-level violations and VLM-based Contextual Judge for contextual risk assessment. Built on MobileRisk-Live benchmark with realistic trajectories and fine-grained annotations.

Result: OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics in detecting safety concerns in mobile agent operations.

Conclusion: The framework provides critical insights for developing safer autonomous mobile agents and establishes foundation for mobile agent safety research.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel training algorithm for Large Vision-Language Models that reformulates reasoning as posterior inference using amortized variational inference, with diversity-seeking RL and Bayesian inference-scaling to improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training algorithms (SFT, PPO, GRPO) for Chain-of-thought reasoning in LVLMs don't generalize well across unseen tasks and rely heavily on biased reward models, limiting interpretability and reliability.

Method: Reformulate reasoning as posterior inference using amortized variational inference, introduce diversity-seeking RL with sparse token-level rewards for diverse latent CoT, and implement Bayesian inference-scaling with marginal likelihood for efficient rationale ranking.

Result: Empirically demonstrates enhanced performance on seven reasoning benchmarks, showing improvements in effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art LVLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of existing training approaches by combining variational inference, diversity-seeking RL, and Bayesian scaling to improve reasoning capabilities in LVLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Motivation: Real-world legal experiments are costly or infeasible, so simulating legal societies with AI provides an effective alternative for legal theory verification and administration support.

Method: Introduces Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework that simulates legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms (legislation, adjudication, enforcement).

Result: Experiments show LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends compared to real-world data, and micro-level simulations reveal that well-functioning, transparent, adaptive legal systems better protect vulnerable individuals' rights.

Conclusion: LLM-based legal society simulation is feasible and provides valuable insights about legal system design and effectiveness, particularly for protecting vulnerable populations.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

TL;DR: MSRANetV2 is a CNN architecture for colorectal cancer tissue classification that achieves high accuracy (99%+) on two public datasets using multi-scale feature fusion and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal cancer diagnosis using conventional methods like colonoscopy is subjective, time-consuming, and variable. Deep learning can enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency in digital pathology.

Method: Proposed MSRANetV2 with ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation blocks. Uses channel alignment and upsampling for multi-scale feature fusion. Evaluated with five-fold cross-validation on CRC-VAL-HE-7K and NCT-CRC-HE-100K datasets.

Result: Achieved average precision: 0.9884±0.0151, recall: 0.9900±0.0151, F1-score: 0.9900±0.0145, AUC: 0.9999±0.00006, accuracy: 0.9905±0.0025 on 7K dataset; and similar high performance on 100K dataset. Grad-CAM visualizations provided interpretability.

Conclusion: MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing model for colorectal cancer tissue classification, validated through comprehensive evaluation on public datasets.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for surgical scene understanding by integrating 3D acoustic information with visual data, creating 4D audio-visual representations that enable spatial and temporal awareness of tool-tissue interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical scene understanding approaches rely mainly on visual data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling. The authors aim to enhance surgical scene representations by incorporating 3D acoustic information for better multimodal understanding.

Method: The framework projects acoustic localization from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies relevant temporal segments of tool-tissue interactions, which are then spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation.

Experimental evaluation shows accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion of multimodal data, providing comprehensive dynamic representations of surgical activity.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first approach for spatial sound localization in dynamic surgical scenes, representing a significant advancement toward multimodal surgical scene representations. The integration of acoustic and visual data enables richer contextual understanding and provides a foundation for future intelligent surgical systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A neuromuscular speech interface that converts EMG signals from facial muscles directly into audio using self-supervised speech representations, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech generation without articulatory models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a direct interface between muscle activity during speech and synthesized audio, leveraging the relationship between self-supervised speech features and EMG signals.

Method: Linear mapping of self-supervised speech features to EMG power, with gesture-specific clustering in feature space, then direct mapping of EMG signals to speech feature space for synthesis.

Result: Strong linear relationship between SS features and EMG power (r=0.85), structured clusters for different articulatory gestures, and successful end-to-end EMG-to-speech generation.

Conclusion: Self-supervised speech models implicitly encode articulatory mechanisms, enabling direct EMG-to-speech conversion without explicit articulatory modeling or vocoder training.

Abstract: We present a neuromuscular speech interface that translates electromyographic
(EMG) signals collected from orofacial muscles during speech articulation
directly into audio. We show that self-supervised speech (SS) representations
exhibit a strong linear relationship with the electrical power of muscle action
potentials: SS features can be linearly mapped to EMG power with a correlation
of $r = 0.85$. Moreover, EMG power vectors corresponding to different
articulatory gestures form structured and separable clusters in feature space.
This relationship: $\text{SS features}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{linear mapping}}$
$\text{EMG power}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{gesture-specific clustering}}$
$\text{articulatory movements}$, highlights that SS models implicitly encode
articulatory mechanisms. Leveraging this property, we directly map EMG signals
to SS feature space and synthesize speech, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech

*Zihan Liu,Zhikang Niu,Qiuyang Xiao,Zhisheng Zheng,Ruoqi Yuan,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Jianze Liang,Xie Chen,Leilei Sun,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: STAR-Bench is a new benchmark that measures audio 4D intelligence - reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, revealing significant gaps in current models' fine-grained perceptual reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio benchmarks primarily test semantics recoverable from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained perceptual reasoning that requires understanding sound dynamics in both time and space.

Method: STAR-Bench combines Foundational Acoustic Perception (six attributes under absolute/relative regimes) with Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (segment reordering, spatial tasks including static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories). Data curation uses procedurally synthesized/physics-simulated audio for foundational tasks and a four-stage human-annotated process for holistic data.

Result: Evaluation of 19 models shows substantial gaps compared to humans, with far larger performance drops (-31.5% temporal, -35.2% spatial) than caption-only benchmarks. Closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning.

Conclusion: STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing models with more robust understanding of the physical world through improved audio 4D intelligence.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large
Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that
can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained
perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as
reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to
measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six
attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete
processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source
relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two
methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use
procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we
follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection
based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only
answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops
(-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically
hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared
with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked
by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception,
knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear
path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of
the physical world.

*Xun Su,Hiroyuki Kasai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Noise Combination Sampling, a method that synthesizes optimal noise from a subspace to approximate measurement scores, enabling natural integration of conditional information in diffusion models for inverse problems without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dilemma in diffusion models for inverse problems: excessive observation integration disrupts generation, while insufficient integration fails to enforce constraints.

Method: Synthesizes optimal noise vector from noise subspace to approximate measurement score, replacing standard noise term in DDPM process. Enables conditional embedding without step-wise hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Achieves superior performance with negligible computational overhead, especially when generation steps T is small. Significantly improves robustness and stability across various inverse problem solvers including image compression.

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling provides an effective solution for embedding conditional information in diffusion models for inverse problems, offering improved performance and stability without computational burden.

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical machine learning and deep learning models struggle with high-dimensional and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing to improve classification efficiency in image classification tasks.

Method: Uses ResNet-50 for feature extraction from RGB potato disease images, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, then processes features through QSVM models with ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X quantum feature maps to transform classical data into quantum states.

Result: The Z-feature map-based QSVM achieved 99.23% accuracy, outperforming classical SVM and Random Forest models using five-fold stratified cross-validation.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical model using Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs) achieves 83.33% accuracy for pneumonia detection, outperforming classical CNNs (73.33%) with better convergence and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of CNNs in pneumonia detection, including high computational costs, limited feature representation, and poor generalization with small datasets, by leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature extraction.

Method: Uses a quanvolutional layer with parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2 image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling layers to generate non-classical features, then feeds these to a classical neural network for classification.

Result: The proposed QNN achieves 83.33% validation accuracy compared to 73.33% for a comparable classical CNN, demonstrating enhanced convergence and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: QNNs show significant potential for medical image analysis, particularly with limited labeled data, and provide a computationally efficient alternative to traditional approaches, laying foundation for quantum computing integration in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

*Yohan Abeysinghe,Muhammad Akhtar Munir,Sanoojan Baliah,Ron Sarafian,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Yinon Rudich,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynCast is a neural forecasting model that improves PM concentration predictions, especially for extreme pollution events, using transformer architecture and diffusion-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution is a major global health risk, and existing models often underestimate hazardous pollution spikes from wildfires, haze, and dust storms, making accurate forecasting essential for public health warnings.

Method: Uses a regionally adapted transformer backbone with diffusion-based stochastic refinement, integrating meteorological and air composition data from ERA5 and CAMS datasets, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory.

Result: Substantial gains in forecasting fidelity across PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 variables, especially under extreme conditions, without compromising global accuracy.

Conclusion: SynCast provides a scalable foundation for next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

### [168] [What do vision-language models see in the context? Investigating multimodal in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331)
*Gabriel O. dos Santos,Esther Colombini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic study of in-context learning (ICL) in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), revealing that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to effectively integrate visual information from demonstrations, highlighting limitations in multimodal ICL capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ICL has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in VLMs remains underexplored. The authors aim to understand how VLMs perform multimodal ICL and identify key factors influencing their performance.

Method: Evaluated seven VLMs across four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. Analyzed prompt design, architectural choices, training strategies, and attention patterns with increasing in-context demonstrations.

Result: Training on image-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but doesn't ensure effective multimodal integration. Instruction tuning improves instruction-following but reduces reliance on demonstrations. Attention analysis shows VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have limited capacity for multimodal integration in ICL, highlighting key limitations that need addressing to enhance their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

### [169] [Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24503)
*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Theiß,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses client drift in Federated Learning with heterogeneous data by proposing FLIU, a modified FedAvg with adaptive personalization that balances local performance and generalization to out-of-distribution samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local models in Federated Learning converge to local optima during training, causing client drift when aggregated with FedAvg. Personalized FL focuses only on local performance but neglects generalization, which is a key benefit of FedAvg for robustness.

Method: Proposed FLIU (Federated Learning with Individualized Updates) extends FedAvg with an individualization step using an adaptive personalization factor. Evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 under IID, pathological non-IID, and novel Dirichlet distribution test environments.

Result: The study provides thorough evaluation of FL approaches across different communication round stages, examining both local performance and generalization capabilities under various distributional conditions.

Conclusion: FLIU offers a balanced approach that addresses client drift while maintaining generalization capabilities, providing improved performance in heterogeneous data environments compared to standard FedAvg and personalized FL methods.

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes BERT-ViT-EF and DTCN models for multimodal sentiment analysis using early fusion and contrastive learning to improve cross-modal interactions and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand human emotions by jointly analyzing text and images through multimodal approaches that provide richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal methods.

Method: BERT-ViT-EF combines BERT for text and ViT for images via early fusion. DTCN extends this with additional Transformer layer for text refinement and contrastive learning to align text-image representations.

Result: DTCN achieves best performance on TumEmo (78.4% accuracy, 78.3% F1-score) and competitive results on MVSA-Single (76.6% accuracy, 75.9% F1-score).

Conclusion: Early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in Transformer-based architectures significantly benefit multimodal sentiment analysis performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

*Shuang Geng,Wenli Zhang,Jiaheng Xie,Rui Wang,Sudha Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Closed-Loop LLM-Knowledge Graph framework that integrates depression detection from social media with knowledge expansion, creating a mutually reinforcing cycle between prediction and medical knowledge development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies use medical knowledge to improve depression prediction but miss the opportunity to expand that knowledge through the predictive process itself. There's a need for systems that can both leverage and evolve domain knowledge.

Method: Developed a two-phase iterative framework: (1) Knowledge-aware depression detection using LLM for joint depression detection and entity extraction, with knowledge graph for entity weighting and prediction refinement; (2) Knowledge refinement and expansion where new entities, relationships, and types are incorporated into the knowledge graph under expert supervision.

Result: The framework enhanced both predictive accuracy and medical understanding using large-scale user-generated content. Expert evaluations confirmed discovery of clinically meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to existing literature.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated the co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge through mutually reinforcing prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction processes, providing a foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces number-to-event reasoning, a task that infers interpretable structured events from numerical time-series data, addressing the limitation of LLMs in understanding purely numerical signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong multimodal reasoning but struggle with numerical time-series understanding. Existing methods focus on forecasting without explaining the latent events driving numerical changes or the reasoning process.

Method: Proposes a reasoning-aware framework with: agent-guided event extractor (AGE), marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS), and two-stage fine-tuning combining time-series encoder with structured decoder.

Result: Experiments on multi-domain datasets show substantial improvements over strong LLM baselines in event-level precision and recall.

Conclusion: The approach enables LLMs to explain and predict events directly from numerical dynamics, bridging quantitative reasoning and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight delays highlight inefficiencies in air traffic management and impact network performance, requiring better prediction methods from air traffic controllers' perspective.

Method: Integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information (flight info, weather reports, aerodrome notices) by adapting trajectory data into language modality to capture airspace conditions.

Result: Model consistently achieves sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual delay-related information.

Conclusion: Linguistic understanding combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory information enhances delay prediction, showing practicality and scalability for real-world operations with real-time updates.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUStReason is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating sarcasm detection in VideoLMs, featuring modality-specific cue annotations and reasoning steps. The paper also introduces PragCoT, a framework that helps VideoLMs focus on implied intentions rather than literal meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which requires identifying relevant cues across modalities and reasoning pragmatically to infer speaker's intention. VideoLMs have limitations in these areas.

Method: Introduces MUStReason benchmark with annotations of modality-specific cues and reasoning steps. Proposes PragCoT framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on implied intentions over literal meaning for sarcasm detection.

Result: The benchmark enables quantitative and qualitative evaluation of generated reasoning by disentangling perception and reasoning. PragCoT helps improve sarcasm detection by emphasizing pragmatic reasoning.

Conclusion: MUStReason provides a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating VideoLMs' sarcasm detection capabilities, and PragCoT offers an effective approach to enhance their ability to understand implied intentions in multimodal sarcasm.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

*Zhichao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT is a novel RL framework for LLM alignment that minimizes discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models through joint normalization, converting reward maximization into a convex MSE loss problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods: PPO/GRPO's direct reward maximization complexity, DPO/UNA's offline nature limiting exploration, and the intractable term problem when using implicit rewards.

Method: Combines GRPO's multi-response generation, DPO's implicit reward formulation, and UNA's implicit-explicit alignment principle. Uses joint normalization of implicit and explicit rewards to eliminate intractable terms, transforming the problem into convex MSE optimization.

Result: Achieves superior reasoning and alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks with faster convergence, better generalization, reduced overfitting, and computational efficiency compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: GIFT provides a stable, convex, and analytically differentiable framework that maintains on-policy exploration while requiring fewer hyperparameters and achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Abstract: We introduce GraphNet, a dataset of 2.7K real-world deep learning
computational graphs with rich metadata, spanning six major task categories
across multiple deep learning frameworks. To evaluate tensor compiler
performance on these samples, we propose the benchmark metric Speedup Score
S(t), which jointly considers runtime speedup and execution correctness under
tunable tolerance levels, offering a reliable measure of general optimization
capability. Furthermore, we extend S(t) to the Error-aware Speedup Score ES(t),
which incorporates error information and helps compiler developers identify key
performance bottlenecks. In this report, we benchmark the default tensor
compilers, CINN for PaddlePaddle and TorchInductor for PyTorch, on computer
vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) samples to demonstrate the
practicality of GraphNet. The full construction pipeline with graph extraction

### [178] [Listening without Looking: Modality Bias in Audio-Visual Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24024)
*Yuchi Ishikawa,Toranosuke Manabe,Tatsuya Komatsu,Yoshimitsu Aoki*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper analyzes modality bias in audio-visual captioning models, finding that LAVCap shows strong audio bias. It introduces AudioVisualCaps dataset with balanced audio-visual annotations and shows training on this dataset reduces modality bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand modality complementarity and robustness in audio-visual captioning models, particularly when one modality is degraded, and to address the observed audio bias in current models.

Method: Conducted systematic modality robustness tests on LAVCap by selectively suppressing/corrupting audio or visual streams. Created AudioVisualCaps dataset by augmenting AudioCaps with joint audio-visual textual annotations.

Result: LAVCap exhibits pronounced audio bias. Training on AudioVisualCaps reduces modality bias compared to training on AudioCaps, leading to more balanced use of both modalities.

Conclusion: Current audio-visual captioning models have significant modality bias, but this can be mitigated through balanced training data like AudioVisualCaps, resulting in more robust and complementary modality usage.

Abstract: Audio-visual captioning aims to generate holistic scene descriptions by
jointly modeling sound and vision. While recent methods have improved
performance through sophisticated modality fusion, it remains unclear to what
extent the two modalities are complementary in current audio-visual captioning
models and how robust these models are when one modality is degraded. We
address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on
LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we
selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify
sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward
the audio stream in LAVCap. To evaluate how balanced audio-visual captioning
models are in their use of both modalities, we augment AudioCaps with textual
annotations that jointly describe the audio and visual streams, yielding the
AudioVisualCaps dataset. In our experiments, we report LAVCap baseline results
on AudioVisualCaps. We also evaluate the model under modality robustness tests
on AudioVisualCaps and the results indicate that LAVCap trained on
AudioVisualCaps exhibits less modality bias than when trained on AudioCaps.

*Wanting Huang,Weiran Wang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper presents an attention-based contextual biasing method for ASR that uses a discriminative objective to filter candidate phrases and improve recognition accuracy through shallow fusion biasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ASR performance by integrating external knowledge (user-specific phrases/entities) during decoding through effective contextual biasing.

Method: Uses an attention-based biasing decoder to score candidate phrases based on acoustic features, with a per-token discriminative objective that encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing distractors.

Result: Experiments on Librispeech biasing benchmark show the method effectively filters out majority of candidate phrases and significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions when used in shallow fusion biasing.

Conclusion: The approach is modular, compatible with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially boost performance of other biasing methods.

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) by integrating
external knowledge, such as user-specific phrases or entities, during decoding.
In this work, we use an attention-based biasing decoder to produce scores for
candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an ASR encoder,
which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for
shallow-fusion biasing. We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that
encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing
distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our
method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and
significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions
when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing. Our approach is modular and
can be used with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially
boost performance of other biasing methods.

*Yuansheng Ni,Songcheng Cai,Xiangchao Chen,Jiarong Liang,Zhiheng Lyu,Jiaqi Deng,Kai Zou,Ping Nie,Fei Yuan,Xiang Yue,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisCode-Multi-679K dataset, VisPlotBench benchmark, and VisCoder2 models to address limitations in visualization coding agents, achieving 82.4% execution pass rate with multi-language support and iterative debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based coding agents for visualization often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Current datasets and benchmarks are too narrow, focusing on single-round generation and single-language tasks.

Method: Created three resources: (1) VisCode-Multi-679K - a large-scale dataset with 679K validated executable visualization samples and multi-turn correction dialogues across 12 languages; (2) VisPlotBench - a benchmark for systematic evaluation with executable tasks and protocols for generation and self-debug; (3) VisCoder2 - a family of multi-language visualization models trained on the dataset.

Result: VisCoder2 significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches GPT-4.1 performance. With iterative self-debug, it reaches 82.4% overall execution pass rate at 32B scale, particularly excelling in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.

Conclusion: The introduced resources effectively address key challenges in visualization coding agents, enabling reliable multi-language code generation with iterative correction capabilities that significantly improve practical workflow performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of
generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing
models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage,
unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has
been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round
generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents.
VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K
validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction
dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for
systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and
protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we
present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on
VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms
strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary
models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching
82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or
compiler-dependent languages.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PRDBench is a new benchmark for evaluating code agents using 50 real-world Python projects with structured requirements, comprehensive evaluation criteria, and reference implementations, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks through agent-driven construction and flexible evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code agent benchmarks have high annotation costs, require expertise, and rely primarily on rigid unit test metrics, limiting their effectiveness for project-level software development evaluation.

Method: Proposed an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline with human supervision to generate diverse project-level tasks, creating PRDBench with 50 Python projects across 20 domains, each with Product Requirement Documents and reference implementations, using Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm for scoring.

Result: PRDBench demonstrates effectiveness in assessing both code agents and evaluation agents, providing a scalable framework with rich data sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics beyond unit tests.

Conclusion: PRDBench offers a robust and scalable solution for code agent evaluation at the project level, overcoming limitations of existing benchmarks through agent-driven construction and comprehensive evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in code agents have enabled automated software development at
the project level, supported by large language models (LLMs) and widely adopted
tools. However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major
limitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid
evaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these
challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that
leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging
project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel
benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with
structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive
evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data
sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an
Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of
various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench
demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents
and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation
and evaluation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboOmni is a multimodal framework that enables robots to proactively infer user intentions from contextual cues (spoken dialogue, sounds, visual information) rather than explicit commands, using an end-to-end omni-modal LLM approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models rely on explicit instructions, but real human-robot collaboration requires proactive intention inference from contextual multimodal cues rather than direct commands.

Method: Proposed RoboOmni framework with Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor architecture using end-to-end omni-modal LLMs. Fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for intention recognition and supports direct speech interaction. Created OmniAction dataset with 140k episodes for training.

Result: RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal contextual instruction setting and RoboOmni framework enable more natural human-robot interaction by allowing robots to proactively infer intentions from multimodal contextual cues rather than requiring explicit commands.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid
progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.
Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and
proactive assistance.

*Raman Jha,Yang Zhou,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive keyframe selection method for 3D scene reconstruction that combines error-based selection using photometric/SSIM errors with momentum-based threshold adjustment to dynamically select informative frames in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data bottleneck in real-time perception for dynamic environments by creating high-quality 3D world representations from compressed data streams, enabling scalable robot learning in complex environments.

Method: Two complementary modules: error-based selection using photometric and SSIM errors, and momentum-based update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds based on scene motion dynamics.

Result: Significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies, with consistent reconstruction quality improvements across Spann3r and CUT3R frameworks. Ablation study confirms effectiveness of individual components.

Conclusion: The method represents a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes, addressing key challenges in real-time 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive keyframe selection method for improved
3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments. The proposed method integrates
two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing
photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based
update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according
to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames,
our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This
allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a
compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and
deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies,
such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings
highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can
dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our
proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements
in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive
ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our
method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.

### [184] [ZTRS: Zero-Imitation End-to-end Autonomous Driving with Trajectory Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24108)
*Zhenxin Li,Wenhao Yao,Zi Wang,Xinglong Sun,Jingde Chen,Nadine Chang,Maying Shen,Jingyu Song,Zuxuan Wu,Shiyi Lan,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ZTRS is a zero-imitation end-to-end autonomous driving framework that combines sensor inputs with reinforcement learning for robust planning, eliminating imitation learning entirely and achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving frameworks rely on Imitation Learning (IL) which suffers from sub-optimal expert demonstrations and covariate shift, while RL approaches are limited to low-dimensional inputs. There's a need for full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data without IL limitations.

Method: ZTRS uses offline reinforcement learning with Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO), a policy gradient variant for enumerable actions and rewards. It operates directly on high-dimensional sensor data without imitation learning.

Result: ZTRS achieves state-of-the-art performance on Navhard benchmark and outperforms IL-based baselines on HUGSIM. It demonstrates strong performance across Navtest, Navhard, and HUGSIM benchmarks.

Conclusion: ZTRS successfully eliminates imitation learning entirely while maintaining robust performance on high-dimensional sensor data, combining the benefits of sensor inputs and RL training for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into
ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and
to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation
Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and
covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is
typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and
maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We
introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory
Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs
without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of
our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only
learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.
ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive
Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable
actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three
benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop
planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM
(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the
state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on
HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DynaRend is a 3D-aware representation learning framework that learns triplane features through masked reconstruction and future prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering, enabling improved robotic manipulation policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for robotic manipulation either focus on static semantics/scene geometry through 2D vision pretraining or emphasize 2D dynamics through video prediction, failing to jointly learn geometry, semantics, and dynamics required for effective manipulation.

Method: Pretrains on multi-view RGB-D video data using masked reconstruction and future prediction with differentiable volumetric rendering to learn unified triplane representations that capture spatial geometry, future dynamics, and task semantics.

Result: Demonstrates substantial improvements in policy success rate, generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability across diverse manipulation tasks on RLBench, Colosseum benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: DynaRend effectively learns 3D-aware and dynamics-informed representations that can be transferred to downstream robotic manipulation tasks via action value map prediction, addressing key challenges in learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge
due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent
approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised
representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms
such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or
scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize
2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and
dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present
DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and
dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future
prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on
multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future
dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned
representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic
manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two
challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic
experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,
generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability
across diverse manipulation tasks.

Motivation: To develop an efficient LiDAR-only localization system for large-scale outdoor environments that can work with various sensor models while maintaining high accuracy and low storage requirements.

Method: Uses Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing on ground areas, employs R2D2 place recognition network or SIFT for keypoint identification, and performs BEV image map registration with prior maps stored as 2D raster images.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets, achieves ATE below 50 cm on Ouster OS2 128 sequences, supports multiple sensors (Velodyne, Ouster, Aeva, Livox), and requires only 4 MB storage per square kilometer.

Conclusion: GroundLoc provides an effective LiDAR-only localization solution that meets online runtime requirements while supporting various sensor models with minimal storage needs for large-scale outdoor environments.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce GroundLoc, a LiDAR-only localization pipeline
designed to localize a mobile robot in large-scale outdoor environments using
prior maps. GroundLoc employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing
on the perceived ground area and utilizes the place recognition network R2D2,
or alternatively, the non-learning approach Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT), to identify and select keypoints for BEV image map registration. Our
results demonstrate that GroundLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets across various sensors. In the multi-session
localization evaluation, GroundLoc reaches an Average Trajectory Error (ATE)
well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences while meeting online runtime
requirements. The system supports various sensor models, as evidenced by
evaluations conducted with Velodyne HDL-64E, Ouster OS2 128, Aeva Aeries II,
and Livox Avia sensors. The prior maps are stored as 2D raster image maps,
which can be created from a single drive and require only 4 MB of storage per
