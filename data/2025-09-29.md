### [1] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-model architecture with Projected Fusion and Differential Feature Learning to detect LLM hallucinations, finding that hallucination signals are highly concentrated in sparse feature subsets, enabling efficient detection with minimal feature dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack precise localization of hallucination signals within LLM layers, limiting development of efficient detection methods despite known layer differences between hallucinatory and factual content.

Method: Dual-model architecture with Projected Fusion block for adaptive inter-layer feature weighting and Differential Feature Learning mechanism that identifies discriminative features through parallel encoders learning complementary representations.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements on question answering and dialogue tasks, revealing hierarchical funnel pattern where shallow layers have high feature diversity and deep layers show concentrated usage, maintaining performance with only 1% of feature dimensions.

Conclusion: Hallucination signals are more concentrated than previously assumed, offering pathway toward computationally efficient detection systems that reduce inference costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [2] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Contextual Influence Value (CI value) to improve RAG by measuring context quality through performance degradation when removing each context, eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG suffers from poor-quality retrieved contexts containing irrelevant/noisy information, and existing context selection methods show limited gains due to failure in holistic information utilization.

Method: Reconceptualizes context quality assessment as inference-time data valuation using CI value metric, with a parameterized surrogate model that captures query-context relevance and inter-context interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs show significant outperformance over state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

Conclusion: The CI value approach provides an effective solution for context selection in RAG by integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment without complex hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at

### [3] [Context Is What You Need: The Maximum Effective Context Window for Real World Limits of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)
*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals that the maximum effective context window (MECW) of LLMs is significantly smaller than advertised maximum context windows (MCW), with models failing at much smaller token counts and showing performance degradation based on problem types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the real-world effectiveness of LLM context windows since providers report large maximum sizes but actual performance may differ significantly.

Method: Defined MECW concept, formulated testing methods across various context sizes and problem types, and created standardized comparison metrics to identify failure points across multiple models.

Result: Found significant differences between MCW and MECW - most models had severe accuracy degradation by 1000 tokens, some failed with as little as 100 tokens, and all fell short of their MCW by up to 99%. MECW varies by problem type.

Conclusion: The maximum effective context window is much smaller than advertised and depends on problem type, providing actionable insights for improving model accuracy and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

### [4] [How Large Language Models Need Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21404)
*Xiaotie Deng,Hanyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI needs human-crafted symbols as a compass to guide LLMs beyond scaling for genuine discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI development focuses too much on scaling, but this alone cannot unlock genuine discovery. LLMs have powerful intuition but lack direction.

Method: Propose using human-crafted symbols as a compass to guide large language models' intuition.

Result: Not specified in abstract - conceptual proposal for future AI development.

Conclusion: Human-crafted symbols are essential to provide direction and enable genuine discovery in AI systems, complementing their powerful but blind intuition.

Abstract: We argue that AI's future requires more than scaling. To unlock genuine
discovery, large language models need a compass: human-crafted symbols to guide
their powerful but blind intuition.

### [5] [One Model, Many Morals: Uncovering Cross-Linguistic Misalignments in Computational Moral Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21443)
*Sualeha Farid,Jayden Lin,Zean Chen,Shivani Kumar,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent moral judgments across different languages, revealing cultural misalignment and calling for more culturally-aware AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how language mediates moral decision-making in LLMs and address concerns about their ability to generalize ethical judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Method: Translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five culturally and typologically diverse languages for multilingual zero-shot evaluation, using carefully constructed research questions to analyze underlying drivers of moral judgment disparities.

Result: Significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment, with disparities driven by disagreements in reasoning strategies and influenced by pretraining data.

Conclusion: The study reveals systematic moral reasoning errors in LLMs across languages, necessitating development of more culturally-aware AI systems through a structured typology of moral reasoning errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

### [6] [LLM-Based Support for Diabetes Diagnosis: Opportunities, Scenarios, and Challenges with GPT-5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21450)
*Gaurav Kumar Gupta,Nirajan Acharya,Pranal Pande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5 shows strong performance in diabetes diagnosis and management across multiple clinical scenarios, aligning well with ADA standards and demonstrating potential as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes affects over half a billion people globally with rising prevalence, but early recognition remains challenging due to vague symptoms, borderline lab values, gestational complexity, and long-term monitoring demands. LLMs offer opportunities to enhance decision support with structured, interpretable outputs.

Method: Evaluated GPT-5 using a simulation framework built on synthetic cases aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025, inspired by public datasets (NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, MIMIC-IV). Tested five scenarios: symptom recognition, lab interpretation, gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication detection.

Result: GPT-5 showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria across all tested scenarios. It successfully classified cases, generated clinical rationales, produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries.

Conclusion: GPT-5 may function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients in diabetes care, while highlighting the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing LLMs in healthcare.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

### [7] [Diagnosing the Performance Trade-off in Moral Alignment: A Case Study on Gender Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21456)
*Guangliang Liu,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of performance trade-offs in moral alignment of language models shows that downstream task degradation is driven by overall forgetting levels, not selective stereotype forgetting, and current mitigation approaches are ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why moral alignment through fine-tuning causes downstream task performance degradation, specifically investigating the mechanisms behind performance trade-offs in gender stereotype mitigation.

Method: Analyzed the relationship between forgetting, fairness objectives, and downstream performance through empirical investigation of selective forgetting mechanisms in language model moral alignment.

Result: Found that: (1) downstream performance is determined by overall forgetting level; (2) selective stereotype forgetting increases overall forgetting; (3) existing general forgetting mitigation methods fail to improve downstream performance.

Conclusion: Current fairness objectives have limitations in achieving performance trade-offs, and new approaches are needed that address overall forgetting rather than just selective forgetting of stereotypes.

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

### [8] [A State-of-the-Art SQL Reasoning Model using RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21459)
*Alnur Ali,Ashutosh Baheti,Jonathan Chang,Ta-Chung Chi,Brandon Cui,Andrew Drozdov,Jonathan Frankle,Abhay Gupta,Pallavi Koppol,Sean Kulinski,Jonathan Li,Dipendra Misra,Krista Opsahl-Ong,Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz,Matei Zaharia,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a simple RL framework for enterprise reasoning tasks using verifiable rewards, achieving state-of-the-art results on the BIRD SQL generation benchmark without proprietary models or extra training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop custom reasoning models via RL that can incorporate organization-specific knowledge for enterprise problems where reward functions are verifiable (RLVR setting).

Method: Applied RLVR to BIRD benchmark using a training recipe with careful prompt/model selection, warm-up stage with offline RL approach (TAO), followed by rigorous online RLVR training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on BIRD private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency, requiring fewer generations than second-best approach.

Conclusion: The simple framework is broadly applicable to enterprise domains like business intelligence, data science, and coding, demonstrating the potential of RLVR for enterprise reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [9] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLVR methods for LLM reasoning discard distributional token information. Mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) addresses this by operating in continuous mixture space, achieving substantial improvements in reasoning tasks with higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods sample discrete tokens and discard rich distributional information from the model's probability distributions, unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space.

Method: Propose mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR, creating a unified framework that extends RLVR to operate directly in continuous mixture space for chain-of-thought generation, including training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings.

Result: MoT-G methods achieve 5-35% gains on 7 out of 10 reasoning tasks compared to standard decoding with Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: MoT-G's benefits stem from maintaining higher hidden-state entropy throughout reasoning and promoting exploration in token space, demonstrating the value of preserving distributional information in RLVR approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

### [10] [Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation: Improving Classifier Accuracy with Train-Time-Only Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21487)
*Jillian Xu,Dylan Zhou,Vinay Shukla,Yang Yang,Junrui Ruan,Shuhuai Lin,Wenfei Zou,Yinxiao Liu,Karthik Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD) improves classification accuracy like Chain-of-Thought prompting but eliminates the throughput penalty by using separate classification and reasoning heads, achieving 96-142x faster inference than CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting's accuracy improvements and its significant throughput penalty from rationale generation.

Method: Adds a pooled classification head for training/inference and a reasoning head supervised by teacher rationales used only in training, with a weighted loss function combining label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss.

Result: Achieves 0.65-5.47% relative gains over pooled baselines on seven SuperGLUE tasks, with larger gains on entailment/causal tasks, while matching pooled classifier throughput and exceeding CoT decoding by 96-142 times in QPS.

Conclusion: DHRD successfully decouples reasoning benefits from inference costs, providing CoT-like accuracy improvements without the throughput penalty.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

### [11] [On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Carolyn Rosé,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are more vulnerable to structural than semantic code perturbations, with pseudocode and flowcharts being as effective as actual code. Corrupted code with surface regularities remains competitive, and different programming languages show task-specific advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which aspects of code data most enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, as it remains unclear what specific properties of code contribute to improved reasoning.

Method: Systematic framework using parallel instruction datasets in 10 programming languages with controlled perturbations disrupting structural or semantic properties. Finetuned LLMs from 5 model families and 8 scales on each variant, evaluating on natural language, math, and code tasks across 3,331 experiments.

Result: LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, especially on math and code tasks. Pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code. Corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface regularities persist. Different languages show task-specific gains: Python favors natural language reasoning, while Java and Rust favor math.

Conclusion: Structural properties of code are crucial for LLM reasoning, and appropriate abstractions can be equally effective while using fewer tokens. The findings provide insights for designing training data to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India's agro-based economy needs accessible agricultural information for optimal growth, and farmers require 24/7 access to farming-related queries.

Method: Built a chatbot using sentence embedding model with entity extraction and synonym elimination techniques on Kisan Call Center dataset.

Result: Initial accuracy of 56% with sentence embedding model, improved to 86% after eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction.

Conclusion: The system enables easier access to farming information, improves agricultural output, and reduces workload on call center staff.

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural
practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to
answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based
on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer
queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government
schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic
device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The
system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

*Chibuzor Okocha,Kelechi Ezema,Christan Grant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for African-accented English, finding consistent performance penalties for clinical speech across models due to short turns and frequent overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand domain effects in speaker diarization, particularly for African-accented English in clinical settings, and identify the causes of performance degradation in clinical dialogues.

Method: Evaluated multiple production and open systems on general and clinical dialogues using strict DER protocol with overlap scoring. Performed error analysis and tested lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning segmentation module on accent-matched data.

Result: Found consistent domain penalty for clinical speech across all models, attributed mainly to false alarms and missed detections. Domain adaptation reduced error but did not eliminate the performance gap.

Conclusion: Results indicate need for overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps to address domain effects in speaker diarization.

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

### [14] [Generation-Time vs. Post-hoc Citation: A Holistic Evaluation of LLM Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21557)
*Yash Saxena,Raviteja Bommireddy,Ankur Padia,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares two citation paradigms for LLMs in high-stakes domains: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite) that produces answers and citations together, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite) that adds citations after drafting. The study finds a trade-off between coverage and correctness, with P-Cite achieving better coverage and G-Cite prioritizing precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthy LLMs must cite verifiable sources in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law where errors have severe consequences. Practitioners need guidance on whether to generate citations during decoding or add them after drafting.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of both citation paradigms from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four attribution datasets, analyzing trade-offs across use cases.

Result: P-Cite methods achieve high coverage with competitive correctness and moderate latency, while G-Cite methods prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. Retrieval is the main driver of attribution quality in both paradigms.

Conclusion: Recommend a retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications, reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings like strict claim verification.

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

TL;DR: ComPSum is a personalized multi-document summarization framework that analyzes fine-grained user preference differences and generates structured user analysis to guide personalized summary generation. It outperforms baselines on the PerMSum dataset using the AuthorMap evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective personalization in multi-document summarization by identifying fine-grained differences between users' preferences through comparative analysis of different users' preferences.

Method: ComPSum framework first generates structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users' preferences, then uses this analysis to guide personalized summary generation. The approach is evaluated using AuthorMap evaluation framework and PerMSum dataset.

Result: ComPSum outperforms strong baselines on the PerMSum dataset when evaluated using the AuthorMap framework for personalized multi-document summarization.

Conclusion: The proposed ComPSum framework effectively addresses personalized multi-document summarization by leveraging comparative user preference analysis, and the AuthorMap evaluation framework provides robust assessment of personalization quality.

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs can translate multimodal planning tasks into formal PDDL language for reliable planning, outperforming end-to-end approaches but struggling with vision-based object relation capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs handle simple multimodal planning but fail at long-horizon tasks requiring complex action sequences. Text-only planning has improved by using LLMs as formalizers rather than direct planners, but multimodal formalization remains underdeveloped with oversimplified approaches.

Method: Developed five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines for one-shot, open-vocabulary, multimodal PDDL formalization. Evaluated on existing benchmarks and introduced two new benchmarks for authentic, multi-view, low-quality image planning scenarios.

Result: VLM-as-formalizer significantly outperforms end-to-end plan generation. Vision capabilities are the main bottleneck - VLMs often miss necessary object relations. Intermediate textual representations (captions, scene graphs) provide partial performance improvements but with inconsistent gains.

Conclusion: VLM-based formalization is superior to end-to-end planning but limited by vision capabilities. Future research should focus on improving multimodal planning formalization, particularly in capturing comprehensive object relations from visual inputs.

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This pilot study evaluates multilingual AI models' ability to translate figurative language across 24 regional dialects, finding that while grammatically correct, culturally nuanced translations require substantial human refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing LLM translation research that focuses on grammatical accuracy but overlooks cultural appropriateness and localization quality, which are critical for real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.

Method: Evaluated 87 LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional dialects of 20 languages using human reviewers who provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to tone, meaning, and intended audience.

Result: Leading models produce grammatically correct translations but struggle with culturally nuanced language, frequently mistranslating figurative expressions and wordplay even in high-resource languages that top industry benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cultural appropriateness is a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance, challenging the assumption that data volume is the most reliable predictor of translation quality, and highlighting the need for expanded research to inform reliable machine translation in culturally diverse contexts.

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

### [19] [OjaKV: Context-Aware Online Low-Rank KV Cache Compression with Oja's Rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21623)
*Yuxuan Zhu,David H. Yang,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri,Keerthiram Murugesan,Tejaswini Pedapati,Pin-Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV is a novel KV-cache compression framework that combines hybrid storage (preserving first/recent tokens in full-rank) with online subspace adaptation using Oja's algorithm, enabling memory-efficient long-context inference without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KV-cache compression methods use static, offline-learned subspaces that perform poorly under data distribution shifts, creating a memory bottleneck for long-context LLM inference where KV cache can exceed model weights in size.

Method: Hybrid storage policy preserves crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, while compressing intermediate tokens using low-rank compression with online subspace adaptation via Oja's algorithm. Includes comprehensive updates during prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding.

Result: OjaKV maintains or improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios, with strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks requiring complex reasoning. Fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention.

Conclusion: OjaKV establishes a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning, demonstrating the importance of online subspace adaptation for dynamically tracking context shifts.

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

*Avash Palikhe,Zichong Wang,Zhipeng Yin,Rui Guo,Qiang Duan,Jie Yang,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey comprehensively reviews explainable AI (XAI) techniques for language models, organizing them by transformer architectures and evaluating them based on plausibility and faithfulness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The black-box nature of language models raises critical interpretability concerns, especially for high-stakes applications, while existing XAI methods face limitations when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures and capabilities.

Method: The survey organizes XAI techniques according to transformer architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder), analyzes method adaptations for each architecture, and evaluates techniques through plausibility and faithfulness lenses.

Result: The paper provides a structured analysis of XAI method effectiveness across different LM architectures and identifies their respective strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open research challenges and outlines future directions to guide development of robust, transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for language models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReviewScore to detect misinformed peer reviews in AI conferences by identifying incorrect premises in weaknesses and already-answered questions, with 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions found misinformed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer review quality is degrading in AI conferences due to exploding submission numbers, creating a need to reliably detect low-quality reviews.

Method: Proposed an automated engine to reconstruct explicit and implicit premises from review weaknesses, built a human-annotated ReviewScore dataset, and evaluated eight state-of-the-art LLMs for automated ReviewScore evaluation.

Result: Found moderate human-model agreements on ReviewScore evaluation, with premise-level factuality assessment showing significantly higher agreements than weakness-level evaluation.

Conclusion: Premise-level factuality evaluation is more effective than weakness-level assessment, and there is potential for fully automated ReviewScore evaluation to improve peer review quality.

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Result: The benchmark provides standardized evaluation with fixed dataset splits and robust metrics including Accuracy, Macro-F1, Topic BERTScore, and Effective Number of Topics.

Conclusion: GRAB enables reproducible and standardized comparison of various topic models on financial disclosures, supporting better risk categorization for oversight and investment purposes.

Abstract: Risk categorization in 10-K risk disclosures matters for oversight and
investment, yet no public benchmark evaluates unsupervised topic models for
this task. We present GRAB, a finance-specific benchmark with 1.61M sentences
from 8,247 filings and span-grounded sentence labels produced without manual
annotation by combining FinBERT token attention, YAKE keyphrase signals, and
taxonomy-aware collocation matching. Labels are anchored in a risk taxonomy
mapping 193 terms to 21 fine-grained types nested under five macro classes; the
21 types guide weak supervision, while evaluation is reported at the macro
level. GRAB unifies evaluation with fixed dataset splits and robust

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToG-3 introduces a multi-agent framework with dynamic graph construction and dual-evolution mechanism to overcome limitations of static graph-based RAG methods, enabling precise reasoning with lightweight LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods face fundamental trade-offs: manual graph construction is expensive to scale, while automatic extraction is limited by LLM performance, especially with smaller models. Static graph indexes don't adapt to actual queries.

Method: Proposes Think-on-Graph 3.0 with Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism. Uses dynamic construction of Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index with dual-evolution of query and sub-graph. Employs multi-agent system (Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, Responser) for iterative evidence retrieval and graph refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments show ToG-3 outperforms baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of MACER framework components.

Conclusion: ToG-3's dual-evolving multi-agent system enables adaptive graph index construction during reasoning, overcoming static graph limitations and enabling precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

TL;DR: ProPerSim introduces a framework for developing proactive and personalized AI assistants that learn from user feedback to make timely recommendations in home scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing demand for AI assistants that are both proactive and personalized, but current approaches have not sufficiently combined these two aspects.

Method: ProPerSim is a simulation framework where a user agent with a persona interacts with an assistant, providing ratings on suggestions. ProPerAssistant uses retrieval-augmented learning and preference alignment to adapt through user feedback.

Result: Experiments with 32 diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily improves user satisfaction over time.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates the promise of combining proactivity and personalization in AI assistants through continuous learning from user feedback.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

TL;DR: Fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8B parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy for multi-question answering over lengthy contexts, offering cost-effective deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs for QA over lengthy contexts faces high computational costs and latency, especially when answering multiple questions from the same context in industrial settings.

Method: Extensive experiments benchmarking both proprietary and public LLMs on multi-question answering tasks using the same conversational context.

Result: Strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve best overall performance, but fine-tuned public LLMs (up to 8B parameters) can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned public LLMs demonstrate potential for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications despite computational challenges.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

### [26] [Self-Speculative Biased Decoding for Faster Live Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21740)
*Linxiao Zeng,Haoyun Deng,Kangyuan Shu,Shizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Speculative Biased Decoding is a novel inference method for streaming applications that uses recent output as draft to accelerate simultaneous translation, achieving 1.7x speedup and 80% flicker reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with streaming applications where output must update continuously as input grows, while maintaining low computational cost for latency requirements.

Method: Proposes using most recent output as draft for growing input context, with biased decoding during verification to increase draft acceptance rate, eliminating need for separate draft computations.

Result: Achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional auto-regressive re-translation without quality loss, and reduces flickering by 80% using display-only mask-k technique.

Conclusion: The approach provides a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications without requiring draft computations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

*Zhen Xiong,Yujun Cai,Zhecheng Li,Junsong Yuan,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thinking-with-Sound (TwS) framework enhances Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) by enabling audio-domain reasoning through numerical analysis and digital manipulation, significantly improving robustness on challenging audio tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LALMs perform well on basic audio understanding tasks but struggle with complex acoustic scenarios that require tools like noise suppression and source separation. They lack the ability to actively analyze and manipulate audio signals during reasoning.

Method: TwS framework combines linguistic reasoning with on-the-fly audio-domain analysis through multimodal reasoning. It enables models to perform numerical analysis and digital manipulation of audio signals, treating audio as dynamic rather than static input.

Result: On the MELD-Hard1k benchmark with acoustic perturbations, state-of-the-art LALMs showed >50% accuracy drop compared to clean audio. TwS achieved substantial improvements: small models gained 24.73% absolute accuracy, with scaling improvements up to 36.61% for larger models.

Conclusion: Audio CoT (Chain of Thought) through TwS significantly enhances model robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing more robust audio understanding systems by enabling active thinking with sound.

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

TL;DR: SynerGen is a generative recommender model that unifies personalized search and recommendation using a single decoder-only Transformer backbone, achieving improved performance on both retrieval and ranking tasks through joint optimization and time-aware positional embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mis-calibration and engineering overhead in traditional retrieve-then-rank pipelines, and bridge the gap between existing generative models that typically specialize in either personalized search or query-free recommendation but struggle to unify both effectively.

Method: Uses a decoder-only Transformer trained on behavioral sequences with joint optimization: InfoNCE loss for retrieval and hybrid pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking. Introduces time-aware rotary positional embeddings to incorporate temporal information into attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong generative recommender and joint search/recommendation baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for industrial-scale unified information access, showing that semantic signals from search can improve recommendation and vice versa.

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

### [29] [Navigating the Impact of Structured Output Format on Large Language Models through the Compass of Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21791)
*Han Yuan,Yue Zhao,Li Zhang,Wuqiong Luo,Zheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Causal analysis reveals structured output has minimal causal impact on LLM generation quality, contradicting conflicting prior findings from coarse metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicting findings about structured output's impact on LLM generation quality using rigorous causal inference methods.

Method: Used causal inference with five potential causal structures to analyze structured output's influence across eight reasoning tasks on GPT-4o.

Result: Coarse metrics showed mixed effects, but causal analysis found no causal impact in 43/48 scenarios, with only 5 showing effects influenced by specific instructions.

Conclusion: Structured output generally has minimal causal impact on LLM generation quality, with prior conflicting findings likely due to methodological limitations.

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

### [30] [Evaluating and Improving Cultural Awareness of Reward Models for LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21798)
*Hongbin Zhang,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Yang Xiang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARB is a benchmark for evaluating cultural awareness in reward models, revealing deficiencies in current RMs and proposing Think-as-Locals with RLVR to improve cultural understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward model evaluations lack culturally relevant datasets, making it difficult to assess cultural awareness which is crucial for global alignment of LLMs.

Method: Created CARB benchmark covering 10 cultures across 4 domains, then proposed Think-as-Locals approach using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit deeper cultural reasoning.

Result: Current RMs show deficiencies in cultural awareness modeling and rely on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural understanding. CARB performance correlates with downstream multilingual cultural alignment.

Conclusion: Think-as-Locals with RLVR effectively mitigates spurious feature interference and advances culture-aware reward modeling, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

### [31] [Redefining Machine Simultaneous Interpretation: From Incremental Translation to Human-Like Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21801)
*Qianen Zhang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) with four adaptive actions (SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION, PRONOMINALIZATION) implemented in a decoder-only LLM framework, achieving improved semantic quality and lower latency compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional encoder-decoder policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address the real-time constraints and quality requirements of Simultaneous Machine Translation.

Method: Implemented four adaptive actions in a decoder-only LLM framework with action-aware prompting for training, and developed a latency-aware TTS pipeline for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on ACL60/60 benchmarks show consistent improvements in semantic metrics (COMET-KIWI) and lower delay (Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines.

Conclusion: Enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation, with DROP and SENTENCE_CUT combination yielding the best balance between fluency and latency.

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

### [32] [Towards Minimal Causal Representations for Human Multimodal Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21805)
*Menghua Jiang,Yuncheng Jiang,Haifeng Hu,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CaMIB introduces a causal multimodal information bottleneck model that improves out-of-distribution generalization by disentangling causal features from dataset biases using information bottleneck and causal principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning methods are vulnerable to dataset biases, causing models to conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in poor out-of-distribution generalization.

Method: Applies information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, uses parameterized mask generator to disentangle multimodal representations into causal and shortcut subrepresentations, incorporates instrumental variable constraint for global consistency, and adopts backdoor adjustment by randomly recombining features.

Result: Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and sarcasm detection with OOD test sets demonstrate effectiveness. Theoretical and empirical analyses highlight interpretability and soundness.

Conclusion: CaMIB effectively addresses dataset bias issues in multimodal learning and improves out-of-distribution generalization through causal principles.

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans on most linguistic puzzle types except for writing systems and understudied languages, enabling automated puzzle generation to promote linguistics education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLM capabilities in solving linguistic puzzles from Linguistic Olympiads and use insights to automate puzzle generation for expanding interest in linguistics.

Method: Extended existing benchmark for linguistic puzzle solving, tested state-of-the-art LLMs including OpenAI's o1 across various linguistic topics, analyzed performance gaps, and applied findings to puzzle generation.

Result: LLMs demonstrated superior performance over humans on most puzzle types, except for puzzles involving writing systems and understudied languages where human performance remained better.

Conclusion: Automated linguistic puzzle generation shows promise for promoting linguistics education and disseminating knowledge about rare languages, highlighting its importance as a research task.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

### [34] [ResT: Reshaping Token-Level Policy Gradients for Tool-Use Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21826)
*Zihan Lin,Xiaohan Wang,Jie Cao,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ResT reshapes policy gradients for LLM tool-use tasks using entropy-informed token reweighting, achieving state-of-the-art performance by stabilizing training and improving convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLM tool-use rely on sparse outcome rewards without considering task particularity, leading to high policy-gradient variance and inefficient training.

Method: Proposed ResT reshapes policy gradients through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting reasoning tokens during training to enable smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning.

Result: ResT achieves state-of-the-art results on BFCL and API-Bank benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by up to 8.76% and surpassing GPT-4o by 4.11% on single-turn tasks and 1.50% on multi-turn tasks when fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM.

Conclusion: The entropy-aware token reweighting scheme in ResT effectively stabilizes convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks and enables more efficient training of LLM agents for tool invocation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

### [35] [Semantic Agreement Enables Efficient Open-Ended LLM Cascades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21837)
*Duncan Soiffer,Steven Kolawole,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic agreement between ensemble outputs serves as a training-free signal for reliable deferral in LLM cascade systems, achieving target-model quality at 40% cost while reducing latency by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cascade systems balance cost and quality in LLM deployment but face challenges in determining output reliability for open-ended text generation where quality lies on a continuous spectrum with multiple valid responses.

Method: Proposes semantic agreement (meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs) as a training-free signal for deferral, which doesn't require model internals and works across black-box APIs.

Result: Semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%, evaluated across models from 500M to 70B parameters.

Conclusion: Semantic agreement provides a practical baseline for real-world LLM deployment that remains robust to model updates and works without requiring model internals.

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework that decomposes empathetic response generation into analysis and synthesis stages, combining deep understanding with expressive generation to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between analytical depth of specialized models and generative fluency of LLMs in empathetic response generation.

Method: Task-decomposed reasoning framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process through a pipeline for analysis and synthesis.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based evaluations.

Conclusion: Structured decomposition is a promising paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents.

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowMT-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn long-form question answering in knowledge-intensive domains, revealing that multi-turn contexts degrade factual accuracy and efficiency, but RAG can mitigate this degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-turn dialogue or assess orthogonal capabilities rather than knowledge-intensive factuality in multi-turn settings, creating a critical gap in evaluating real-world LLM performance.

Method: Introduces KnowMT-Bench with dynamic evaluation where models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories from progressive question sequences, then evaluates final-turn answers using human-validated automated pipeline across medicine, finance, and law domains.

Result: Multi-turn contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to contextual noise from self-generated histories, and information efficiency drops as models become more verbose with longer dialogues. RAG effectively alleviates and can reverse factual degradation.

Conclusion: The benchmark is crucial for evaluating and enhancing conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world knowledge-intensive applications, with RAG showing promise as a mitigation strategy.

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The linear nature of LoRA limits expressiveness in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, motivating the development of non-linear extensions.

Method: Proposed LoRAN as a non-linear extension of LoRA using lightweight transformations on low-rank updates, and introduced Sinter - a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without increasing parameter count.

Result: Experiments across summarization and classification tasks show LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal Sinter outperforms standard activations like Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.

Conclusion: The activation design is crucial in low-rank tuning, and LoRAN with Sinter provides an effective non-linear extension to LoRA that enhances performance while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without

*Min-Hsuan Yeh,Yixuan Li,Tanwi Mallick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LUMINA is a framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems by measuring context-knowledge signals using distributional distance for external context and token evolution across transformer layers for internal knowledge, achieving superior performance without extensive hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate despite having correct context, due to imbalance between external context and internal knowledge usage. Existing detection methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting generalizability.

Method: Quantifies external context utilization via distributional distance and internal knowledge utilization by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers, with statistical validation framework.

Result: Achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG benchmark, and remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching.

Conclusion: LUMINA offers an effective and practical solution for hallucination detection in RAG systems that doesn't require extensive hyperparameter tuning and maintains robustness across different conditions.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

*Thanh-Long V. Le,Myeongho Jeon,Kim Vu,Viet Lai,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL-ZVP is a novel algorithm that extracts learning signals from zero-variance prompts in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods like GRPO ignore zero-variance prompts where all responses receive the same reward, missing potential learning opportunities from these scenarios.

Method: RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors in zero-variance prompts without requiring contrasting responses, using token-level characteristics to modulate feedback.

Result: Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieved up to 8.61 points improvement in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, consistently outperforming other baselines.

Conclusion: Zero-variance prompts contain valuable learning signals and should not be filtered out in RLVR, as demonstrated by RL-ZVP's significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QoNext is a framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles to evaluate foundation models, focusing on user interaction experience rather than just output correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations fail to capture user experience during interaction, focusing only on output correctness and overlooking how response quality and interaction interplay affects user satisfaction.

Method: QoNext identifies experiential factors, incorporates them into controlled experiments with human ratings under varied configurations, constructs a QoE-oriented database, and trains predictive models to estimate perceived user experience from system parameters.

Result: QoNext enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation of foundation models and provides actionable guidance for optimizing productized services.

Conclusion: The QoNext framework successfully bridges the gap in foundation model evaluation by focusing on user experience through QoE principles, offering practical optimization guidance.

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EMoE enables Mixture-of-Experts models to scale activated experts at inference without performance degradation by training experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and improving router selection quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoE models degrade performance when activating more experts at inference than during training, due to lack of learned collaboration among experts.

Method: Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE) framework that simultaneously trains experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encourages high-quality router selections.

Result: EMoE expands performance-scaling range to 2-3× training-time k and pushes peak performance to higher levels across various MoE settings.

Conclusion: EMoE enables flexible inference-time scaling of MoE models without additional training overhead while improving overall performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a systematic methodology and dataset for Turkish citation intent classification, addressing challenges in agglutinative languages. It uses DSPy framework for automated prompt optimization and achieves 91.3% accuracy with stacked ensemble.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding citation intent is crucial for academic research assessment, but poses unique challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish that lack adequate datasets and methods.

Method: Created a new Turkish citation intent dataset with annotation tool. Used DSPy framework for automated prompt optimization with LLMs, then employed stacked generalization ensemble with XGBoost meta-model for final classification.

Result: The ensemble method achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3%, significantly outperforming standard In-Context Learning approaches which suffered from inconsistent results due to manual prompt design.

Conclusion: This study provides the Turkish NLP community with foundational dataset and robust classification framework, paving the way for future qualitative citation studies in Turkish and similar agglutinative languages.

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

### [44] [AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910)
*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE is a multi-agent LLM framework that improves automated scoring by extracting rubric components from student responses and using them for final scoring, enhancing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based automated scoring faces challenges like low accuracy, prompt sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment, hindering practical implementation in education.

Method: Proposes AutoSCORE with two agents: Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent extracts rubric-relevant components into structured representation, and Scoring Agent uses this to assign final scores, mimicking human grading process.

Result: AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK, correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) across diverse tasks and rubrics, with strong benefits on complex rubrics and especially large gains on smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Structured component recognition combined with multi-agent design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated scoring in education.

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimulSense is a novel framework for simultaneous speech translation that mimics human interpreters by continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions when new sense units are perceived, achieving superior quality-latency tradeoff and 9.6x faster decision-making than state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SimulST systems require specialized interleaved training data and rely on computationally expensive LLM inference for decision-making, which limits their real-time efficiency and practical deployment.

Method: Proposes SimulSense framework that continuously reads input speech and triggers write decisions when new sense units are perceived, mimicking human interpreter behavior without requiring specialized training data or expensive LLM inference.

Result: Achieves superior quality-latency tradeoff compared to two state-of-the-art baseline systems, with decision-making up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

Conclusion: SimulSense provides a more efficient and practical approach to simultaneous speech translation by mimicking human interpreter decision-making patterns, offering substantial improvements in real-time efficiency without compromising translation quality.

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting degrades performance for 86.3% of LLMs on clinical text tasks, creating a paradox where interpretability improves but reliability decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate CoT prompting effectiveness in clinical contexts using EHR data, where accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe deployment.

Method: Large-scale study assessing 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks across 9 languages and 8 task types, with fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error profiles using both LLM-as-a-judge and clinical expert evaluation.

Result: Contrary to prior findings in other domains, CoT causes consistent performance degradation for most models (86.3%), with more capable models remaining relatively robust while weaker ones suffer substantial declines.

Conclusion: CoT creates a critical paradox in clinical contexts by enhancing interpretability but undermining reliability, highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy reasoning approaches in clinical LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

TL;DR: ThaiFACTUAL is a lightweight calibration framework that reduces political bias in LLMs for Thai political stance detection through counterfactual data augmentation and rationale-based supervision, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show systematic biases in Thai political stance detection due to indirect language, polarized figures, and entangled sentiment-stance relationships, undermining fairness and reliability in culturally complex settings.

Method: Uses counterfactual data augmentation and rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance, along with creating the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers.

Result: Significantly reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves fairness across multiple LLMs while maintaining model-agnostic properties.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages and provides an effective framework for political bias mitigation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have potential for accelerating academic ideation but face challenges in grounding ideas and mitigating confirmation bias for refinement.

Method: Proposes a framework combining Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. MotivGraph stores problem, challenge, and solution nodes for motivation grounding. The Ideator uses dual-agent Socratic questioning for rigorous refinement.

Result: On ICLR25 paper topics dataset, MotivGraph-SoIQ outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses LLM ideation limitations by providing essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps through motivational knowledge graphs and Socratic dialogue.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

*Seongho Joo,Kyungmin Min,Jahyun Koo,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A black-box hallucination detection method for LLMs that uses uncertainty expression to identify factual vs non-factual responses without requiring internal model states or external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs like GPT3 often generate non-factual responses (hallucinations), but existing detection methods require external resources or internal model states, which are often unavailable through restricted APIs.

Method: Proposes a black-box detection metric based on analyzing LLM behavior under uncertainty expression, finding that factual responses are consistent while non-factual ones are inconsistent.

Result: The proposed metric is more predictive of factuality in model responses than baselines that use internal knowledge of LLMs.

Conclusion: The black-box approach using uncertainty expression provides an effective foundation for hallucination detection in LLMs without requiring internal model access.

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective reasoning from complex queries.

Method: GraphSearch organizes retrieval into a modular framework with six modules for multi-turn interactions and iterative reasoning, plus a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based text data and relational queries over structural graph data.

Result: Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that GraphSearch consistently improves answer accuracy and generation quality over traditional strategies.

Conclusion: GraphSearch is confirmed as a promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation, effectively addressing the limitations of existing approaches through its comprehensive dual-channel retrieval and modular workflow.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC), a framework that combines LLM semantic priors with fuzzy membership degrees to handle ambiguity and uncertainty in text, improving interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in NLP with LLMs, challenges remain in handling ambiguous, polysemous, or uncertain texts that traditional probability-based methods struggle with.

Method: FRC integrates LLM semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, enabling explicit interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning to gradually transform ambiguous inputs into clear decisions.

Result: Validation on sentiment analysis tasks shows FRC ensures stable reasoning, facilitates knowledge transfer across model scales, and captures conflicting/uncertain signals that traditional methods miss.

Conclusion: FRC provides a general mechanism for managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and robustness in NLP tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

TL;DR: RedNote-Vibe is the first longitudinal dataset for social media AI-generated text analysis, spanning 5 years from pre-LLM era to July 2025, with a proposed interpretable detection framework PLAD that uses psycholinguistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets mainly focus on static AIGT detection, but social media content evolves over time with user engagement, creating unique challenges that current approaches don't address.

Method: Created RedNote-Vibe dataset from Xiaohongshu platform with user engagement metrics and timestamps, and proposed PLAD framework that leverages psycholinguistic features for interpretable AIGT detection.

Result: PLAD achieves superior detection performance and provides insights into linguistic signatures distinguishing human vs AI-generated content, revealing complex relationships between linguistic features and social media engagement.

Conclusion: The study provides both a valuable longitudinal dataset and an interpretable framework for understanding temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AI-generated content on social media platforms.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and

*Anya Belz,Simon Mille,Craig Thomson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCET creates a standardized taxonomy of quality criteria names and definitions for NLP evaluations to address the problem of misleading comparability when different studies use the same quality criterion names but evaluate different aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks reliable comparability between NLP evaluations due to inconsistent use of quality criterion names, which hampers scientific progress and the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality across multiple independent evaluations.

Method: A strictly descriptive approach deriving a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in NLP, structured into a hierarchy where parent nodes capture common aspects of child nodes.

Result: QCET taxonomy and resources that provide standardized quality criteria definitions and hierarchical structure for mapping the several hundred quality criterion names actually used in NLP.

Conclusion: QCET enables three main uses: establishing comparability of existing evaluations, guiding the design of new evaluations, and assessing regulatory compliance, addressing a pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning.

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

*Wanli Yang,Fei Sun,Rui Tang,Hongyu Zang,Du Su,Qi Cao,Jingang Wang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning is actually effective for model editing when using breadth-first pipeline with mini-batch optimization instead of depth-first sequential editing, and LocFT-BF method achieves state-of-the-art performance scaling to 100K edits and 72B-parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the long-standing belief that fine-tuning is ineffective for model editing, arguing that previous failures stem from suboptimal pipeline design rather than inherent limitations of fine-tuning.

Method: Restore fine-tuning to standard breadth-first (epoch-based) pipeline with mini-batch optimization, and develop LocFT-BF - a localized editing method with systematic analysis of tuning parameter locations.

Result: LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, sustains 100K edits and 72B-parameter models (10x beyond prior practice) without sacrificing general capabilities.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning, when properly implemented with breadth-first pipeline and localized tuning, becomes a leading method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

*Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Denis Makhov,Magauiya Zhussip,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSpaDi is a training-free compression framework that uses structured sparse dictionary learning instead of low-rank decomposition, achieving better accuracy and perplexity than state-of-the-art methods at 20-50% compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank weight approximation in LLM compression imposes rigid structural constraints that lead to noticeable accuracy drops, motivating the need for more flexible compression methods.

Method: CoSpaDi replaces low-rank decomposition with structured sparse factorization using a dense dictionary and column-sparse coefficient matrix, optimized with a small calibration dataset to minimize functional reconstruction error rather than weight approximation.

Result: CoSpaDi demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods in both accuracy and perplexity across multiple Llama and Qwen models at 20-50% compression ratios.

Conclusion: Structured sparse dictionary learning is established as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment, offering better model fidelity without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and

powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

*Justin Vasselli,Eunike Andriani Kardinata,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAS is a framework for generating multilingual dialogues from abstract intent representations, avoiding translation artifacts and improving cultural appropriateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and current approaches using translations introduce artifacts that reduce naturalness and cultural appropriateness.

Method: Dialogue Act Script (DAS) framework uses structured dialogue act representations to encode, localize, and generate multilingual dialogues from abstract intent representations instead of direct translation.

Result: Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show DAS-generated dialogues outperform both machine and human translations on cultural relevance, coherence, and situational appropriateness.

Conclusion: DAS effectively mitigates translationese and enables more fluent, naturalistic multilingual conversations through structured dialogue act representations.

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

### [59] [S2J: Bridging the Gap Between Solving and Judging Ability in Generative Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22099)
*Shaoning Sun,Jiachen Yu,Zongqi Wang,Xuewei Yang,Tianle Gu,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a "solve-to-judge gap" in generative reward models where models can solve problems but fail to judge them correctly, and proposes S2J method to bridge this gap by linking solving and judging capabilities during optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant solve-to-judge gap observed in generative reward models, where models can solve 14%-37% of queries they fail to judge correctly, despite having the necessary problem-solving capabilities.

Method: Proposes Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach that simultaneously leverages both solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision, explicitly linking problem-solving and evaluation abilities during model optimization.

Result: S2J reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2% and enhances judgment performance by 5.8%, achieving SOTA performance among GRMs on the same base model while using significantly smaller training dataset through self-evolution without external model distillation.

Conclusion: The S2J approach effectively bridges the solve-to-judge gap in generative reward models, improving judgment performance while being more data-efficient and self-contained compared to existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

### [60] [Think Right, Not More: Test-Time Scaling for Numerical Claim Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22101)
*Primakov Chungkham,V Venktesh,Vinay Setty,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes VerifierFC, a method that uses test-time scaling (TTS) with a verifier model to improve fact-checking of complex numerical claims by generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the best one, achieving significant performance gains while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with fact-checking real-world numerical claims that require both compositional and numerical reasoning, suffering from reasoning drift issues where they misinterpret information and backtrack during the reasoning process.

Method: The authors systematically explore scaling test-time compute (TTS) to elicit multiple reasoning paths from LLMs, then train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to select the best reasoning path that leads to correct verdicts. They also introduce an adaptive mechanism for selective TTS based on claim complexity.

Result: The approach achieves 18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods and 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, effectively mitigating reasoning drift issues in numerical fact-checking.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling with verifier models significantly improves fact-checking of complex numerical claims by addressing reasoning drift, and adaptive TTS provides an efficient solution that balances performance gains with computational costs.

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

### [61] [Universal Legal Article Prediction via Tight Collaboration between Supervised Classification Model and LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22119)
*Xiao Chi,Wenlin Zhong,Yiquan Wu,Wei Wang,Kun Kuang,Fei Wu,Minghui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Uni-LAP is a universal framework for legal article prediction that combines supervised classification models with large language models using Top-K loss and syllogistic reasoning to improve accuracy across different legal jurisdictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for legal article prediction face challenges: supervised models struggle with complex fact patterns, LLMs underperform in predictive tasks due to abstract legal article IDs, and most approaches lack cross-jurisdictional applicability.

Method: Uni-LAP integrates SCMs and LLMs through tight collaboration. The SCM uses a novel Top-K loss function to generate candidate articles, while the LLM employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine final predictions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on datasets from multiple jurisdictions shows Uni-LAP consistently outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed Uni-LAP framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by combining strengths of SCMs and LLMs, achieving superior performance in legal article prediction across diverse legal systems.

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how multilingual vision-language models handle text and images across languages, identifying key challenges in balancing cross-lingual consistency with cultural adaptation.

Method: Reviewed 31 models and 21 benchmarks, analyzing encoder-only and generative architectures, training methods (mainly contrastive learning), and evaluation approaches (mostly translation-based).

Result: Found current training favors language neutrality over cultural awareness, with two-thirds of benchmarks using translation-based approaches. Identified discrepancies in cross-lingual capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental tension between achieving language neutrality and cultural awareness in multilingual vision-language models, with current methods prioritizing the former while recent work begins incorporating culturally grounded content.

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FoodSEM is a fine-tuned LLM for food named-entity linking that achieves state-of-the-art performance (up to 98% F1) by linking food entities to ontologies like FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and Hansard taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food NEL cannot be accurately solved by general-purpose LLMs or existing domain-specific models, creating a need for specialized food entity linking capabilities.

Method: Uses instruction-response fine-tuning of an open-source LLM to link food entities to multiple ontologies, with comparative analysis against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting baselines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1 scores reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets, significantly outperforming non-fine-tuned versions and baseline approaches.

Conclusion: FoodSEM provides a robust solution for food semantic understanding and establishes a strong baseline for future food NEL benchmarking, with publicly available resources including annotated corpora and the model itself.

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

*Hongyu Shan,Mingyang Song,Chang Dai,Di Liang,Han Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R-Capsule is a framework that compresses reasoning steps into learned latent tokens to improve efficiency while maintaining transparency, inspired by Information Bottleneck principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting increases latency and memory usage due to verbosity and may propagate errors across long reasoning chains.

Method: Compress high-level reasoning plan into small set of learned latent tokens (Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution lightweight. Uses dual objective: task loss for accuracy and plan-reconstruction loss for interpretability.

Result: Reduces token footprint of reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks.

Conclusion: R-Capsule strikes balance between efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our

*Shijing Hu,Jingyang Li,Zhihui Lu,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTO addresses draft policy misalignment in speculative decoding by aligning training with decoding-time tree policy through Draft Tree Reward and Group-based Draft Policy Training, achieving 7.4% longer acceptance length and 7.7% additional speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training objectives optimize only a single greedy draft path while decoding follows a tree policy that verifies multiple branches, creating draft policy misalignment that limits achievable speedups in speculative decoding.

Method: Group Tree Optimization (GTO) with two components: (1) Draft Tree Reward - sampling-free objective equal to expected acceptance length of draft tree under target model; (2) Group-based Draft Policy Training - stable optimization contrasting trees from current and frozen reference draft model with debiased group-standardized advantages and PPO-style surrogate updates.

Result: Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K) tasks with multiple LLMs (LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and yields additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3.

Conclusion: GTO bridges draft policy misalignment and offers a practical, general solution for efficient LLM inference by provably improving acceptance length and speedup through aligned training with decoding-time tree policy.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: MACC is a framework that progressively compresses Chain-of-Thought reasoning through multiround refinement, achieving better accuracy with shorter outputs and lower latency by leveraging token elasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves complex task performance but introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity, creating a need for efficient compression methods.

Method: Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC) leverages token elasticity phenomenon and uses multiround refinement to progressively compress CoTs, determining optimal compression depth for each input.

Result: Achieves 5.6% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, reduces CoT length by 47 tokens on average, significantly lowers latency, and enables reliable performance prediction using interpretable features.

Conclusion: CoT compression is both effective and predictable, enabling efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated fine-tuning across different models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Motivation: To investigate issues around human creativity preservation and authenticity of work in the context of LLMs potentially surpassing human creativity, and to address machine-generated text detection challenges.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive dataset and framework for machine-generated text detection across multiple scenarios, addressing previous limitations in MGTD research.

Conclusion: This work aims to address machine-generated text detection in a more meaningful way than previous approaches, providing tools to differentiate between human and AI-generated content across various scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

TL;DR: CompAs is a meta-learning framework that translates context into compositional adapter parameters, enabling algebraic merging of multiple information chunks without reprocessing long prompts, offering lower inference cost and robustness to long-context limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of in-context learning (inefficient with many demonstrations) and supervised fine-tuning (training overhead, lacks flexibility) by creating a method to map instructions/demonstrations directly into adapter parameters.

Method: Meta-learning framework that generates adapters with compositional structure, allowing algebraic merging of instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved passages. Features reversible encoding enabling context recovery through a decoder.

Result: Outperforms in-context learning and prior generator-based methods on multiple-choice and extractive QA tasks, especially when scaling to more inputs. Provides lower inference cost and robustness to long-context instability.

Conclusion: Composable adapter generation establishes a practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment, with benefits for safety/security through reversible encoding and principled handling of context window limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

TL;DR: Reasoning models consistently outperform or match larger instruction fine-tuned models across various tasks, with increasing benefits at larger scales, though IFT remains more cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate when reasoning becomes effective in LLMs, its relationship with model scale, and the trade-offs between performance and computational costs.

Method: Used synthetic data distillation framework to conduct large-scale supervised study comparing Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models of varying sizes on math-centric and general-purpose tasks in multiple-choice and open-ended formats.

Result: Reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Reasoning models become increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: While IFT remains Pareto-optimal for training and inference costs, reasoning models offer superior performance on complex tasks, especially at larger model scales, suggesting reasoning capabilities are crucial for advancing LLM performance on challenging problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

*Anandi Hattiangadi,Anders J. Schoubye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM outputs are meaningless because they lack the necessary intentions for literal meaning, though they can still appear meaningful and convey knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To argue that large language models cannot produce meaningful outputs due to their inability to have the right kinds of intentions required for literal meaning.

Method: Present a philosophical argument based on two premises: (1) specific intentions are needed for literal meaning, and (2) LLMs cannot possess such intentions. Defend against semantic externalist and internalist counterarguments.

Result: The argument concludes that LLM outputs are meaningless in the literal sense, but acknowledges they can still seem meaningful and enable knowledge acquisition.

Conclusion: While LLM outputs lack literal meaning due to absence of proper intentions, they remain practically useful and can facilitate true belief formation and knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

Motivation: Traditional topic models produce hard-to-interpret keyword clusters and struggle in data-scarce domains, creating a critical interpretability gap that needs addressing.

Method: Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP) leverages LLMs to interactively build a binary tree where each node is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, creating an interpretable taxonomy.

Result: RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than BERTopic's keyword-based topics and serves as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, especially when themes correlate with task labels.

Conclusion: RTP shifts data exploration from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis and enables structured, controllable prompts for generative models, transforming analysis into synthesis tools.

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

### [73] [StableToken: A Noise-Robust Semantic Speech Tokenizer for Resilient SpeechLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22220)
*Yuhan Song,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Aiwei Liu,Wei Jia,Houfeng Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StableToken is a robust semantic speech tokenizer that addresses the fragility of existing tokenizers to acoustic perturbations through a multi-branch architecture with bit-wise voting mechanism, significantly improving token stability and downstream SpeechLLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic speech tokenizers are surprisingly fragile to meaning-irrelevant acoustic perturbations, causing drastic token sequence changes even at high SNRs where speech remains intelligible, which increases learning burden for downstream LLMs.

Method: Proposed StableToken with multi-branch architecture that processes audio in parallel and merges representations through a powerful bit-wise voting mechanism to form stable token sequences.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance (UED) under diverse noise conditions, and significantly improves robustness of SpeechLLMs on various tasks.

Conclusion: The consensus-driven mechanism in StableToken provides foundational stability that directly translates to downstream benefits, making speech tokenizers more robust to acoustic perturbations.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

*Zishan Ahmad,Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Composite Reasoning (CR) enables LLMs to dynamically combine multiple reasoning styles (deductive, inductive, abductive) for improved problem-solving, outperforming existing methods like Chain-of-Thought and DeepSeek-R1 on scientific and medical QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on singular reasoning paradigms, limiting their performance on complex problems requiring diverse cognitive strategies.

Method: Introduces Composite Reasoning (CR) approach that allows LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles including deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning.

Result: Outperforms Chain-of-Thought and DeepSeek-R1 on scientific and medical QA benchmarks, with superior sample efficiency and token usage. Adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles.

Conclusion: Cultivating internal reasoning style diversity enables LLMs to develop more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

### [75] [In Their Own Words: Reasoning Traces Tailored for Small Models Make Them Better Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22230)
*Jaehoon Kim,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD) addresses the failure of reasoning transfer from large to small language models by filtering low-probability tokens through student-guided acceptance, achieving 4.9% performance improvement instead of 20.5% degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct distillation of reasoning traces from larger models to smaller ones often degrades performance due to distributional misalignment, where teacher-generated tokens exceed the student's representation capacity.

Method: Proposed Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD) where teacher proposes tokens but student determines acceptance based on its own probability distributions, filtering out low-probability tokens to create student-friendly reasoning traces.

Result: Qwen3-0.6B trained with direct distillation degraded performance by 20.5%, while RSD-generated traces improved performance by 4.9%. RSD traces are model-specific and not universally applicable.

Conclusion: Low probability tokens are the critical bottleneck in reasoning transfer, and distributional alignment must be tailored to each student architecture's unique internal representation.

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

*Haorui Chen,Chengze Li,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FeatBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM coding agents' "vibe coding" capabilities, focusing on feature implementation from pure natural language descriptions rather than code-level specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are misaligned with the "vibe coding" paradigm as they require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving, neglecting feature implementation scenarios.

Method: FeatBench uses pure natural language prompts, a rigorous multi-level filtering pipeline for data collection, comprehensive test cases (F2P and P2P), and diverse application domains from real-world repositories.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs shows feature implementation is challenging, with only 29.94% success rate. Analysis reveals "aggressive implementation" strategy that leads to both failures and superior design.

Conclusion: Feature implementation in vibe coding paradigm is significantly challenging. FeatBench provides a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLEXI is the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human spoken interaction that evaluates model interruption in emergency scenarios, revealing gaps between open source and commercial models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech LLMs are foundational for natural human-computer interaction but benchmarking and modeling them remains challenging.

Method: Introduces FLEXI benchmark with six diverse human-LLM interaction scenarios that systematically evaluate latency, quality, and conversational effectiveness, focusing on model interruption in emergencies.

Result: Reveals significant gaps between open source and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction latency.

Conclusion: Next token-pair prediction offers a promising path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

*Wenbin Hu,Huihao Jing,Haochen Shi,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLM safety through legal compliance by creating a benchmark based on EU AI Act and GDPR, and develops a Compliance Reasoner using Group Policy Optimization that improves safety compliance by over 10% on both legal frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety methods lack systematic protection and fail to handle complex LLM behaviors, creating a need for rigorous safety standards based on established legal frameworks.

Method: Developed a safety compliance benchmark using legal statutes, then aligned Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to create a Compliance Reasoner that bridges LLM safety with legal standards.

Result: The Compliance Reasoner achieved significant improvements: +10.45% for EU AI Act compliance and +11.85% for GDPR compliance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Approaching LLM safety from legal compliance perspectives provides a systematic and rigorous framework that effectively mitigates safety risks by aligning LLMs with established legal standards.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

*Yifang Zhang,Pengfei Duan,Yiwen Yang,Shengwu Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM is a novel architecture that integrates both structural and semantic information from Knowledge Graphs into LLMs to address hallucination issues, using specialized modules for retrieval, encoding, and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs treat KGs as plain text, missing crucial structural information and facing embedding space gaps between KG encoders and LLMs, limiting effective knowledge integration.

Method: SSKG-LLM uses three modules: Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) and Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) to preserve semantics while utilizing structure, and Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) to help LLMs understand KG embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments show that incorporating structural information from KGs enhances LLMs' factual reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM successfully bridges the gap between KG structural information and LLM reasoning, improving factual accuracy and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

### [80] [Bridging Fairness and Explainability: Can Input-Based Explanations Promote Fairness in Hate Speech Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22291)
*Yifan Wang,Mayank Jobanputra,Ji-Ung Lee,Soyoung Oh,Isabel Valera,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how input-based explanations relate to fairness in hate speech detection, finding they help detect biased predictions and reduce bias during training but are unreliable for selecting fair models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP models often replicate social bias from training data, and their black-box nature makes it hard to recognize biased predictions or mitigate them effectively. While some studies suggest explanations can help detect bias, there's limited large-scale quantitative analysis on explainability in fair NLP.

Method: Conducted the first systematic study of explainability-fairness relationship in hate speech detection using both encoder- and decoder-only models. Examined three dimensions: identifying biased predictions, selecting fair models, and mitigating bias during training.

Result: Input-based explanations effectively detect biased predictions and serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Conclusion: While explanations are valuable for bias detection and mitigation, they should not be solely relied upon for model selection in fairness-critical applications.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly Flan-T5-XXL, achieve 70% accuracy in translating natural language to first-order logic, outperforming GPT-4o and symbolic systems when provided with predicate lists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating natural language to first-order logic translation is crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods but remains challenging, requiring systematic evaluation of LLM approaches.

Method: Systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs using MALLS and Willow datasets, comparing architectures and training strategies including vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training with metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate alignment.

Result: Fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1-0528 with CoT reasoning, and symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and models generalize to unseen logical arguments without specific training.

Conclusion: While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck for natural language to first-order logic translation systems.

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

### [82] [Transformers Can Learn Connectivity in Some Graphs but Not Others](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22343)
*Amit Roy,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers can learn transitive relations on grid-like directed graphs with low-dimensional embeddings, but struggle with complex graphs containing many disconnected components. Model scaling improves generalization on grid graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate transformers' capability to learn transitive relations from training examples and understand how scaling affects this ability, particularly for causal inference applications.

Method: Generated directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes, evaluated their ability to infer transitive relations (graph connectivity) for different graph sizes and structures.

Result: Transformers successfully learn connectivity on grid-like graphs with low-dimensional embeddings, where dimensionality strongly predicts performance. Model scaling improves generalization on grid graphs, but transformers struggle with graphs containing many disconnected components.

Conclusion: Transformers' ability to learn transitive relations depends on graph structure - they excel with grid-like graphs but fail with complex disconnected graphs, and scaling improves performance on learnable structures.

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

Motivation: To apply NLP techniques to historical research, specifically studying religious invectives during the Protestant Reformation in Tudor England.

Method: Created a workflow from raw data to iterative annotation, built the InviTE corpus, and compared fine-tuned BERT models with zero-shot prompted LLMs for invective detection.

Result: Models pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned for invective detection performed better than zero-shot LLMs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned BERT models specialized for historical data outperform zero-shot LLMs in detecting invective language in historical texts.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim at the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques to historical research endeavors, particularly addressing the study
of religious invectives in the context of the Protestant Reformation in Tudor
England. We outline a workflow spanning from raw data, through pre-processing

introduce the InviTE corpus -- a corpus of almost 2000 Early Modern English
(EModE) sentences, which are enriched with expert annotations regarding
invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), which highlights the
superiority of models pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned to
invective detection.

TL;DR: This paper explores applying Bayesian probability theory to relevance-theoretic pragmatics, focusing on how implicit meaning is communicated through conversational implicatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and computational tools have enabled a 'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics. The authors want to extend this Bayesian approach from Rational Speech Act theory to relevance-theoretic pragmatics.

Method: The paper applies Bayesian computational methods to study how implicit meaning is communicated through conversational implicatures within the framework of relevance-theoretic pragmatics.

Result: The paper demonstrates how Bayesian approaches can be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics, showing how probabilistic computation can model the communication of implicit meaning.

Conclusion: Bayesian probability theory provides a promising framework for modeling pragmatic phenomena in relevance-theoretic pragmatics, particularly for understanding how conversational implicatures convey implicit meaning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

TL;DR: CHRONOBERG is a temporally structured corpus of English books spanning 250 years, designed to study linguistic change and improve LLMs' ability to handle diachronic language variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing corpora lack long-term temporal structure, limiting LLMs' ability to understand semantic and normative evolution of language over time.

Method: Curated books from Project Gutenberg with temporal annotations, used VAD analysis to quantify lexical semantic change and created historically calibrated affective lexicons.

Result: Modern LLMs struggle with diachronic meaning shifts, showing need for temporally aware training. The corpus enables detection of discriminatory language and sentiment across different time periods.

Conclusion: CHRONOBERG serves as a scalable resource for studying linguistic change and developing temporally aware LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes
language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers. Open

TL;DR: LLMs are used to perform deep semantic analysis on wind turbine maintenance logs, moving beyond simple classification to generate actionable reliability insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to extract complex insights from unstructured maintenance logs, and existing ML approaches only perform basic classification without deeper reasoning.

Method: An exploratory framework using LLMs for four analytical workflows: failure mode identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data quality auditing.

Result: LLMs successfully function as "reliability co-pilots," synthesizing textual information to generate expert-level hypotheses and actionable insights.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel methodology for using LLMs as reasoning tools to unlock operational intelligence from unstructured data in the wind energy sector.

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind

### [87] [What Is The Political Content in LLMs' Pre- and Post-Training Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22367)
*Tanise Ceron,Dmitry Nikolaev,Dominik Stammbach,Debora Nozza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of OLMO2's training data reveals left-leaning political bias predominance, with pre-training corpora containing more politically engaged content than post-training data, and this bias strongly correlates with model outputs on policy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how political biases arise in LLMs by analyzing training data, which remains largely unexplored in current LLM research, using OLMO2 as a case study since it's the largest fully open-source model with complete dataset access.

Method: Analyzed OLMO2's pre- and post-training corpora by drawing large random samples, automatically annotating documents for political orientation, analyzing source domains and content, and assessing correlation between training data political content and model stance on policy issues.

Result: Left-leaning documents predominate across datasets; pre-training corpora contain significantly more politically engaged content than post-training data; left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics through distinct values and legitimacy sources; predominant training data stance strongly correlates with models' political biases on policy issues.

Conclusion: Political content analysis should be integrated into future data curation pipelines, and filtering strategies need in-depth documentation for transparency to address political bias in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

*Ziheng Chi,Yifan Hou,Chenxi Pang,Shaobo Cui,Mubashara Akhtar,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chimera is a comprehensive test suite with 7,500 Wikipedia diagrams to evaluate VLMs' genuine diagram comprehension and identify three types of shortcuts that inflate performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs appear to perform well on diagram benchmarks but may rely on shortcuts rather than genuine understanding. There's a need to assess whether models truly comprehend diagrams versus exploiting memorization patterns.

Method: Created Chimera test suite with annotated diagrams using semantic triples and multi-level questions testing four comprehension aspects: entity recognition, relation understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. Evaluated 15 VLMs from 7 families.

Result: VLMs' strong performance largely stems from shortcuts: visual-memorization has slight impact, knowledge-recall plays moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts contribute significantly. Models exploit superficial patterns rather than true comprehension.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have critical limitations in genuine diagram understanding. Need more robust evaluation protocols that benchmark true comprehension of complex visual inputs rather than question-answering shortcuts.

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

### [89] [Detecting (Un)answerability in Large Language Models with Linear Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22449)
*Maor Juliet Lavi,Tova Milo,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method that identifies a direction in LLM activation space to detect unanswerable questions in extractive QA, improving generalization across datasets compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide confident but incorrect answers when they lack sufficient information, leading to hallucinations in question answering tasks.

Method: Propose identifying a direction in model's activation space that captures unanswerability by applying activation additions during inference and measuring impact on abstention behavior.

Result: Method effectively detects unanswerable questions and generalizes better across datasets than prompt-based and classifier-based approaches on two LLMs and four QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The identified directions reliably detect unanswerability, extend beyond extractive QA to other unanswerability types, and causal interventions show they effectively control model abstention behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

### [90] [Evaluating the Limits of Large Language Models in Multilingual Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22472)
*Antreas Ioannou,Andreas Shiamishis,Nora Hollenstein,Nezihe Merve Gürel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of LLaMA and Gemini LLMs on multilingual legal benchmarks reveals significant challenges in legal tasks (below 50% accuracy) compared to general tasks (over 70%), with adversarial vulnerabilities and performance correlated to syntactic similarity to English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM capabilities and limitations in high-stakes legal fields, especially in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and adversarial contexts where performance remains insufficiently explored.

Method: Used LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation, tested on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks with character and word-level perturbations, and developed an open-source modular evaluation pipeline for multilingual legal tasks.

Result: Legal tasks pose significant challenges with accuracies often below 50% on legal reasoning benchmarks vs over 70% on general tasks. Gemini outperforms LLaMA by ~24 percentage points. Performance correlates with syntactic similarity to English, and adversarial vulnerability persists across languages.

Conclusion: Despite improvements in newer LLMs, significant challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal applications due to low accuracy on legal reasoning tasks and persistent adversarial vulnerabilities.

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

*Yuqing Zhang,Ecesu Ürker,Tessa Verhoef,Gemma Boleda,Arianna Bisazza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeLLCom-Lex is a neural-agent framework that simulates semantic change by grounding agents in real lexical systems and manipulating their communicative needs, using color naming tasks to study how agents develop human-like lexicons and change behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for studying lexical semantic change have limitations - observational methods cannot identify causal mechanisms, and experimental methods are difficult to apply to extended diachronic processes.

Method: A neural-agent framework that first grounds agents in real lexical systems (e.g., English), then systematically manipulates their communicative needs using color naming tasks, with different supervised and reinforcement learning pipelines.

Result: Neural agents trained to 'speak' an existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a remarkable extent, simulating the evolution of lexical systems within a single generation.

Conclusion: The framework supports further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the mechanisms of semantic change, showing that agents can develop human-like naming behavior and change lexicons according to communicative needs.

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

*Hang Li,Kaiqi Yang,Yucheng Chu,Hui Liu,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Solution divergence in LLM-generated answers correlates with better problem-solving performance and can be used to improve training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the diversity of solutions generated by LLMs for the same problem relates to their problem-solving capabilities, moving beyond traditional SFT and RL approaches.

Method: Propose solution divergence as a novel metric, test it across three problem domains, and use it to enhance both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) strategies.

Result: Higher solution divergence consistently correlates with better problem-solving abilities and improves success rates across different models and problem domains.

Conclusion: Solution divergence is a simple yet effective tool that can advance LLM training and evaluation by leveraging the diversity of generated solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Result: The developed models outperformed the baseline on both machine translation and question answering tasks across all three target languages.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of joint fine-tuning with parameter-efficient methods, data integration, and task-specific enhancements (RAG for Ukrainian, ensembling for Sorbian languages) effectively improves performance for Slavic language tasks under limited resource constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents the JGU Mainz submission to the WMT25 Shared Task on LLMs
with Limited Resources for Slavic Languages: Machine Translation and Question
Answering, focusing on Ukrainian, Upper Sorbian, and Lower Sorbian. For each
language, we jointly fine-tune a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model for both tasks with
parameter-efficient finetuning. Our pipeline integrates additional translation
and multiple-choice question answering (QA) data. For Ukrainian QA, we further
use retrieval-augmented generation. We also apply ensembling for QA in Upper
and Lower Sorbian. Experiments show that our models outperform the baseline on
both tasks.

*Idan Kashani,Avi Mendelson,Yaniv Nemcovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method represents LLMs as linear operators in semantic task space for interpretable model selection and performance prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of selecting the best-performing LLM from large repositories due to limited scalability and interpretability of existing representation learning approaches.

Method: Uses closed-form computation of geometrical properties to represent LLMs as linear operators within prompts' semantic task space without training.

Result: Achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results in success prediction and model selection tasks, with strong performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach provides highly interpretable, scalable, and real-time adaptable LLM representations that can handle dynamically expanding model repositories.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

*Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMBS is a two-stage 1-to-N framework that addresses catastrophic forgetting and inference fragmentation in multi-objective LLM alignment (helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty) by using shared representations and policy-reference steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steering vector approaches for LLM alignment suffer from catastrophic forgetting (when optimizing one objective overwrites others) and inference fragmentation (inconsistent outputs across objectives), especially in 1-to-N Transformer decoders.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage I computes shared post-attention hidden states once; Stage II clones this representation into parallel branches with policy-reference mechanism for objective-specific control while maintaining cross-objective consistency.

Result: AMBS improves average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% on DeepSeek-7B compared to naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art methods across Alpaca, BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMBS provides an effective solution for unified and efficient multi-objective LLM alignment that addresses both catastrophic forgetting and inference fragmentation while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An end-to-end FP8 training recipe for LLMs that achieves near-lossless performance with substantial efficiency gains (22% faster training, 14% lower memory, 19% higher throughput) compared to BF16 baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The immense computational cost of training LLMs is a major barrier to innovation, and while FP8 training offers theoretical efficiency gains, there's no comprehensive open-source recipe available.

Method: Fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy for FP8 training that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: FP8 training achieves performance on par with BF16 baseline across reasoning benchmarks while being remarkably stable and essentially lossless, with 22% reduction in training time, 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and 19% increase in throughput.

Conclusion: FP8 is established as a practical and robust alternative to BF16 for large-scale model training, with code release to democratize access.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Cognitive Reasoning and CogFlow framework to enhance LLMs' social cognition by modeling human interpretive processes through structured cognitive flows and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional logical reasoning in LLMs is inadequate for social situations that require interpretive analysis of ambiguous cues rather than definitive deductions.

Method: Proposes CogFlow framework: curates cognitive flow dataset via tree-structured planning, uses supervised fine-tuning for basic capability, then reinforcement learning with multi-objective reward to optimize cognitive flow and response quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show CogFlow effectively enhances social cognitive capabilities of LLMs and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

Conclusion: Cognitive Reasoning paradigm and CogFlow framework successfully bridge the gap between logical reasoning and social cognition in LLMs, enabling better navigation of ambiguous social situations.

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

TL;DR: Developed a retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) with error ontology and DSPy prompting to improve LLM-assisted patient message response evaluation using historical message-response pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address clinical inaccuracies, omissions, and tone mismatches in LLM-generated draft responses to patient messages via EHR portals, as these errors pose patient safety risks and increase clinician workload.

Method: Created clinically grounded error ontology (5 domains, 59 codes), developed RAEC pipeline using semantically similar historical message-response pairs, and implemented two-stage DSPy prompting for hierarchical error detection.

Result: Retrieval context improved error identification in clinical completeness and workflow domains. Human validation showed superior agreement (50% vs 33%) and performance (F1=0.500 vs 0.256) compared to baseline evaluation on 1,500+ messages.

Conclusion: RAEC pipeline serves as effective AI guardrails for patient messaging, demonstrating that context-enhanced evaluation significantly improves error detection quality over isolated draft assessment.

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

TL;DR: LLMs can localize context-grounded hallucinations in text, but struggle with certain error types, achieving only 0.67 F1 score on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study LLMs' capability for localizing hallucinations as a practical alternative to complex evaluation pipelines, addressing the lack of established benchmarks for meta-evaluation.

Method: Created a challenging benchmark with 1,000+ human-annotated examples, proposed free-form textual description representation for hallucinations, and evaluated four large-scale LLMs with various prompting strategies.

Result: Best model achieved only 0.67 F1 score, showing the benchmark's difficulty. LLMs tend to incorrectly flag missing details as inconsistent and struggle with factually correct but unverifiable information.

Conclusion: LLMs have limited but promising capability for hallucination localization, with identified challenges including difficulty distinguishing missing details from inconsistencies and handling unverifiable but correct information.

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To computationally model deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting outcomes under varying scenarios, leveraging recent NLP advancements.

Method: Collected diverse opinions to create a self-sourced dataset, simulated deliberation using product presentations with striking facts, and compared multiple NLP techniques including Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and Quantum-Deliberation Framework.

Result: The two proposed models (Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and Quantum-Deliberation Framework) outperform existing state-of-the-art models in interpreting deliberative discourse and producing meaningful insights.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate practical applications in public policy-making, debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media opinion mining.

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media
opinion mining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Resampling methods for quantifying uncertainty in multilingual/multitask NLP benchmarks, accounting for both model- and data-related variation to avoid underestimating variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To properly quantify uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual and multitask NLP benchmarks, as experimental variation arises from both model- and data-related sources.

Method: Introduce resampling-based methods that account for both model- and data-related sources of variation in performance scores.

Result: Methods demonstrate how to compute sampling distributions for leaderboard quantities like averages, pairwise differences between models, and rankings using multilingual question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Accounting for both model- and data-related variation is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating overall variability in NLP benchmark evaluations.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

### [104] [StateX: Enhancing RNN Recall via Post-training State Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22630)
*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX is a post-training pipeline that efficiently expands the recurrent state size of pre-trained RNNs (linear attention and state space models) to improve their recall and in-context learning abilities without significantly increasing parameters or training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models are computationally expensive for long contexts, while RNNs have constant per-token complexity but struggle with accurate recall from long contexts due to limited state size. Directly training RNNs with larger states is costly.

Method: Post-training architectural modifications for linear attention and state space models to scale up state size with minimal parameter increase, applied to pre-trained models up to 1.3B parameters.

Result: StateX efficiently enhances recall and in-context learning abilities of RNNs without high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Conclusion: StateX provides an effective solution to improve RNNs' contextual recall while maintaining their computational efficiency advantages over Transformers.

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A variational reasoning framework that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference, unifying variational inference with RL-style methods for improving language model reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models.

Method: Extends evidence lower bound (ELBO) to multi-trace objective for tighter bounds, proposes forward-KL formulation to stabilize variational posterior training, and shows connections to rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL.

Result: Empirically validated on Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across wide range of reasoning tasks, revealing previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions in existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides stable objectives for improving language model reasoning and unifies variational inference with RL-style methods through a principled probabilistic perspective.

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our

### [106] [Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22638)
*Renjie Luo,Zichen Liu,Xiangyan Liu,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wenhu Chen,Wei Lu,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes feedback-conditional policy (FCP) that treats verbal feedback as conditioning signal for LLMs instead of compressing it into scalar rewards, enabling more expressive learning from feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding richness and causing scale imbalance. There's a need for more expressive ways to learn from verbal feedback.

Method: Introduces FCP that learns from response-feedback pairs using maximum likelihood training on offline data, plus online bootstrapping where policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback for refinement.

Result: Reframes feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more expressive approach for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback.

Conclusion: FCP provides an alternative paradigm for LLM training that preserves the richness of verbal feedback by treating it as conditioning signal rather than compressing it into rewards.

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

### [107] [Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641)
*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: N-gram novelty alone is insufficient for measuring creativity as it doesn't account for appropriateness. Expert annotations show 91% of high n-gram novelty expressions aren't creative, and LLMs struggle with pragmaticality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether n-gram novelty adequately captures creativity, which requires both novelty and appropriateness (sensicality and pragmaticality).

Method: Used 7542 expert writer annotations of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality via close reading of human and AI-generated text. Tested zero-shot, few-shot, and finetuned models on identifying creative and non-pragmatic expressions.

Result: N-gram novelty correlates with creativity but 91% of top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty aren't judged creative. LLMs show lower pragmaticality with higher n-gram novelty. Frontier LLMs perform better than random but struggle with non-pragmatic expressions.

Conclusion: N-gram novelty alone is inadequate for measuring creativity. LLMs need improvement in identifying non-pragmatic expressions, though LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores can predict expert preferences.

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

### [108] [WebGen-Agent: Enhancing Interactive Website Generation with Multi-Level Feedback and Step-Level Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22644)
*Zimu Lu,Houxing Ren,Yunqiao Yang,Ke Wang,Zhuofan Zong,Junting Pan,Mingjie Zhan,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebGen-Agent is a website-generation agent that uses multi-level visual feedback from screenshots and GUI-agent testing to iteratively improve code quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code agents rely only on simple code execution feedback, which fails to capture the actual quality of generated websites that depend heavily on visual effects and user-interaction feedback.

Method: Uses visual language model (VLM) to generate detailed text descriptions and suggestions from screenshots and GUI-agent testing, with integrated scoring and backtracking mechanism. Also introduces Step-GRPO training using screenshot and GUI-agent scores as dense process supervision.

Result: Increased Claude-3.5-Sonnet accuracy from 26.4% to 51.9% and appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9 on WebGen-Bench. Step-GRPO training improved Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct accuracy from 38.9% to 45.4% and appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

Conclusion: Comprehensive visual feedback and Step-GRPO training significantly enhance website-generation performance, providing reliable process supervision for improving LLM-based code generation agents.

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceAssistant-Eval is a comprehensive benchmark with 10,497 examples across 13 task categories to evaluate AI assistants' listening, speaking, and viewing capabilities, revealing that proprietary models don't always outperform open-source ones and that smaller models can rival larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating the full range of capabilities of voice-first AI assistants, especially with growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems.

Method: Created VoiceAssistant-Eval benchmark with 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories covering listening (natural sounds, music, spoken dialogue), speaking (multi-turn dialogue, role-play imitation, various scenarios), and viewing (highly heterogeneous images). Evaluated 21 open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio.

Result: Three key findings: (1) proprietary models don't universally outperform open-source models; (2) most models excel at speaking but lag in audio understanding; (3) well-designed smaller models can rival larger ones (Step-Audio-2-mini 7B achieved more than double the listening accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual). Challenges remain in multimodal input and role-play voice imitation.

Conclusion: VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies gaps in current AI assistants and establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating and guiding development of next-generation AI assistants, with code and data to be released publicly.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: A model-agnostic framework using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with random contrastive sampling to improve radiography report generation accuracy without needing reward models or human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RRG methods lack sufficient quality for real-world clinical deployment, while VLMs show promise with LLM-inspired training strategies like alignment techniques.

Method: Proposes Random DPO framework that constructs training pairs through random contrastive sampling, eliminating need for reward models or human preference annotations.

Result: Experiments show up to 5% improvement in clinical performance metrics when supplementing three state-of-the-art models with Random DPO, without requiring additional training data.

Conclusion: The proposed Random DPO framework effectively enhances RRG accuracy in a model-agnostic manner, demonstrating practical potential for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal approach for autism detection using video data, introducing novel gaze descriptors that improve classification accuracy and address limitations of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-aided autism diagnostic methods struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack real-world generalizability, despite the complex and resource-intensive nature of traditional autism diagnosis.

Method: Analyzed a large, balanced dataset (168 ASC, 157 non-autistic participants) using multimodal analysis of facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability, and gaze behavior. Introduced novel statistical descriptors for eye gaze angles and used late fusion for classification.

Result: Improved gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% using new gaze descriptors. Achieved overall classification accuracy of 74% through multimodal fusion, demonstrating effectiveness of integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support autism assessment, with improved gaze analysis aligning computational findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA is a model-agnostic memory compression framework that reduces KV cache memory usage by 36% and speeds up inference by 1.21x through selective context retention and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models face scalability issues due to quadratic attention costs and unbounded KV memory growth during long-horizon inference, which hinders real-time deployment despite improved generalization from scaling.

Method: Partitions KV cache into fixed-size chunks and uses a recurrent gating module to selectively retain high-utility context by learning utility scores, preserving recent detail while pruning stale memory while maintaining causality.

Result: Achieves up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction with minimal impact on task success rates.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable inference for VLA models without requiring modifications to training pipelines or downstream control logic, making it suitable for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

TL;DR: A novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model that detects errors in automatically generated chest radiology reports by verifying findings and their locations using a multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision language models can generate realistic radiology reports but suffer from factual errors and hallucinations, limiting their clinical translation.

Method: Created synthetic dataset by perturbing findings and locations in ground truth reports, then trained a multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network on real/fake findings-location pairs with images.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in finding veracity prediction and localization across multiple X-ray datasets, with 0.997 concordance correlation coefficient with ground truth-based verification for SOTA report generators.

Conclusion: The method shows strong utility for error detection in clinical radiology workflows during inference.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal deep learning architecture (MDF-MLLM) that integrates fine-grained retinal image features with global textual context significantly improves disease classification accuracy from fundus images, achieving 94% accuracy compared to 60% for baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa, necessitating better integration of visual and textual information.

Method: The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM, using patch-wise projection, scaled cross-attention, and FiLM-based U-Net modulation for feature fusion.

Result: MDF-MLLM achieved 94% accuracy on dual-type disease classification, representing a 56% improvement over baseline MLLM (60%). Recall and F1-scores improved by up to 67% and 35% respectively, with particular gains for inherited diseases with rich clinical text.

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM provides a generalizable, interpretable framework for fundus image classification that outperforms traditional MLLMs through multi-scale feature fusion, showing promise for clinical decision support systems and future extension to segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for

### [115] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPDA is a multimodal jailbreak attack that uses image modality to separate harmful semantic components from unsafe prompts, enabling bypassing of safety filters in text-to-image models to generate NSFW content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based jailbreak methods struggle to bypass T2I model safety filters, and image-based vulnerabilities remain unexplored. The authors aim to develop a more effective attack using multimodal approaches.

Method: Three-step process: 1) LLM decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful sub-prompts; 2) LLM rewrites harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts; 3) Visual language model generates captions for iterative refinement to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: The proposed MPDA method successfully bypasses safety filters in text-to-image models to generate NSFW content while maintaining semantic consistency with original unsafe prompts.

Conclusion: MPDA demonstrates the vulnerability of current T2I safety mechanisms to multimodal attacks and highlights the need for more robust safety measures that consider both text and image modalities.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [116] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach for salient object detection that combines supervision from salient object detection, foreground contour detection, and edge detection to address issues of incomplete predictions and inaccurate boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for salient object detection suffer from incomplete predictions due to object complexity and inaccurate boundaries caused by convolution/pooling operations.

Method: Proposes training saliency detection networks using intertwined supervision from salient object detection, foreground contour detection, and edge detection tasks, with a novel mutual learning module (MLM) consisting of multiple network branches trained in mutual learning manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

Conclusion: The multi-task learning approach with mutual learning effectively improves saliency map quality by generating uniform highlight and precise boundaries through joint supervision from multiple related tasks.

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [117] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore is a new evaluation metric for multimodal relevance that handles 3+ modalities using joint representation, outperforming existing bimodal metrics by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal evaluation metrics only work for two modalities, limiting similarity assessment for multiple modalities. There's a need for metrics that can handle N≥3 modalities.

Method: Uses multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space, enabling fair relevance scoring across different modalities at one scale.

Result: MAJORScore increases relevance scoring by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modalities and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistent modalities compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAJORScore provides a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-powered scaffolding inspection system using point cloud data analysis to automate safety assessments and reduce manual inspection errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual scaffolding inspections are time-consuming and prone to human errors, potentially leading to unsafe conditions on construction sites.

Method: Developed a cloud-based AI platform that processes point cloud data of scaffolding structures and compares it with certified reference data to detect structural modifications.

Result: The system enables automated monitoring of scaffolding by detecting deviations from design rules through AI analysis of point cloud data.

Conclusion: AI and digitization can enhance scaffolding inspection accuracy, reduce manual inspection time and effort, and improve construction site safety.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automatic prompt engineering framework for counterfactual size control in text-to-image generation, using evaluator-guided dataset construction, supervised prompt rewriting, and DPO-trained ranking to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained controllability in text-to-image generation remains challenging, especially counterfactual controllability (generating images that contradict common-sense patterns), which is crucial for creativity and exploratory applications.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Image evaluator with enhanced Grounded SAM for dataset construction, 2) Supervised prompt rewriter for revised prompts, 3) DPO-trained ranker for optimal prompt selection. First counterfactual size text-image dataset created.

Result: Achieved 114% improvement over backbone in image evaluator performance. Method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o in counterfactual size generation.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability in text-to-image generation through effective prompt engineering approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two deep neural network architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) for achieving super-resolution in non-fluorescent phase-contrast microscopy, showing they are complementary approaches that perform best under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resolution limitations of conventional optical microscopy (~200nm) without requiring expensive specialized equipment or fluorescent techniques, making super-resolution accessible to normal microscope users.

Method: Used two previously developed DNN architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) to super-resolve images from non-fluorescent phase-contrast microscopy modalities (Zernike PCM and DIC), tested on custom-fabricated nanoscale targets calibrated via AFM.

Result: Both O-Net and Theta-Net performed well but were complementary - O-Net worked better with high SNR images, while Theta-Net performed better with low SNR images, even when using the same training data and epochs.

Conclusion: Model architecture and source image SNR significantly impact super-resolution performance in non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, with different DNN models being optimal for different noise conditions.

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMTF-AVN is a novel audio-visual navigation method that uses multi-target architecture and refined Transformer to dynamically fuse visual and audio cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works overlook deeper perceptual context in audio-visual navigation and fail to effectively leverage multimodal cues for guiding robot navigation to audio sources.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion (DMTF-AVN) with multi-target architecture and refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information from visual observations and auditory signals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Replica and Matterport3D datasets, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Shows strong scalability and generalizability.

Conclusion: DMTF-AVN paves the way for advanced multimodal fusion strategies in robotic navigation by effectively integrating audio-visual cues through dynamic filtering and selective fusion.

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia introduces a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that creates one-to-one concept-neuron mappings, enabling more efficient and precise concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models with significantly reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept unlearning methods require extensive search procedures because individual concept representations are distributed across multiple latent features, even with sparse autoencoders that reduce neuron polysemanticity.

Method: SAEmnesia uses supervised sparse autoencoder training with systematic concept labeling to promote one-to-one concept-neuron mappings, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization through cross-entropy computation during training.

Result: SAEmnesia achieves 96.67% reduction in hyperparameter search, 9.22% improvement on UnlearnCanvas benchmark, and 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object removal in sequential tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables more interpretable representations and superior scalability for concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an intelligent coreset selection method using intra-class clustering to create representative subsets for efficient deep learning training and hyperparameter search in biomedical image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models require substantial computational resources for training and hyperparameter optimization, especially with large datasets. Random sampling for coreset selection can compromise representativeness and fail to capture intra-class diversity.

Method: Introduces a lightweight mechanism that extracts intra-class diversity by forming per-class clusters, which are then used for final sampling to create representative coresets.

Result: Extensive experiments on biomedical imaging datasets show the proposed scheme outperforms random sampling on several performance metrics under uniform conditions.

Conclusion: The intelligent coreset selection method effectively addresses the limitations of random sampling by capturing intra-class diversity, providing a more representative subset for efficient deep learning training and hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam is a deep learning model that uses current and up to four prior mammograms to improve breast cancer prediction by capturing spatial and temporal patterns, outperforming single-visit models in population-based screening settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for breast cancer screening use limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings with imbalanced outcomes and heterogeneous follow-up, requiring robust longitudinal models.

Method: Developed LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks to integrate current and up to four prior mammograms, capturing both spatial and temporal patterns.

Result: LongiMam consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included, outperforming single-visit models. It performed best when combining historical and recent information, and showed efficacy across key risk groups including women with dense breasts and those aged 55+.

Conclusion: Longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction, supporting the use of repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is available as open-source software.

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether CNN architectures correspond to human social cognition processes, specifically image valence appraisal, and finds they struggle with higher-order brain processing beyond simple visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if CNN correspondences with human brain processes extend beyond general visual perception to more complex social cognition tasks like image valence appraisal.

Method: Correlation analysis between CNN architectures and human behavioral/fMRI data for image valence appraisal, plus Object2Brain framework combining GradCAM and object detection at CNN-filter level.

Result: CNNs struggle to go beyond simple visual processing and don't reflect higher-order brain processing for social cognition; different architectures show different object class sensitivities despite similar correlation trends.

Conclusion: The correspondence between CNNs and human brain processes doesn't extend well to complex social cognition tasks, suggesting limitations in current CNN architectures for modeling higher-order cognitive functions.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDebug is an interpretable debugging framework for Concept Bottleneck Models that removes undesired concepts and retrains models using concept-level feedback to reduce reliance on biased shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CBM interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between models and expert reasoning, especially when models learn shortcuts from biased data.

Method: Two-step process: Removal (experts identify/remove undesired concepts) and Retraining (CBDebug converts concept feedback to sample labels for bias mitigation and targeted augmentation).

Result: CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with spurious correlations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces model reliance on undesired concepts through interpretable debugging and targeted retraining.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder is an open-source QGIS plugin that uses deep learning to automatically detect shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of bathymetric data for shipwreck detection is time-consuming and requires expert analysis, creating a need for automated tools.

Method: The tool uses a deep learning model trained on shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and Irish coasts, with synthetic data generation for dataset augmentation. It performs automatic preprocessing, deep learning inference, thresholding, and produces segmentation masks or bounding boxes.

Result: The tool demonstrates superior segmentation performance compared to both a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and classical inverse sinkhole detection methods.

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder provides an effective open-source solution for automated shipwreck detection that is publicly available as a QGIS plugin.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

*Sanish Suwal,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency map focus and faithfulness while maintaining meaningful concepts, but aggressive pruning reduces interpretability by merging features despite preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how magnitude-based pruning affects neural network interpretability, specifically examining both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations.

Method: Used ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, applied magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning, compared Vanilla Gradients and Integrated Gradients explanations across pruning levels, and applied CRAFT-based concept extraction to track semantic coherence changes.

Result: Light-to-moderate pruning improved saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. Aggressive pruning merged heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, but excessive pruning undermines interpretability by reducing feature distinctiveness and semantic coherence.

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Motivation: Existing approaches rely on point cloud input, which limits practical applications since most consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data is more common. There's a need for methods that work directly from multi-view images.

Method: Builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone with two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation using a novel parametric wall representation. Works with multi-view images without ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: using ground-truth point clouds, posed images, and unposed images. Performs on par with specialized 3D object detection methods while significantly advancing layout estimation.

Conclusion: TUN3D sets a new benchmark in holistic indoor scene understanding by enabling joint layout estimation and 3D object detection directly from multi-view images without requiring depth sensors or camera pose ground truth.

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

*Qiyu Ma,Wanli Ni,Zhijin Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative semantic communication system that segments images into key and non-key regions, using different processing methods for each region while employing lightweight deployment strategies to reduce computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication methods often neglect the varying importance of different image regions, potentially compromising reconstruction quality of visually critical content.

Method: Segment images into key and non-key regions; process key regions with image-oriented semantic encoder and non-key regions with image-to-text modeling; employ model quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning for lightweight deployment.

Result: The proposed system outperforms traditional methods in both semantic fidelity and visual quality for image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: The system effectively enhances image transmission by refining semantic granularity and optimizing resource utilization without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

### [132] [Skeleton Sparsification and Densification Scale-Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21398)
*Julia Gierke,Pascal Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel skeletonisation scale-space framework that combines medial axis sparsification with scale-space theory to achieve hierarchical shape simplification while maintaining key scale-space properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The medial axis is sensitive to noise and boundary variations, leading to undesirable skeletal branches. Classical pruning methods exist but lack the theoretical foundation and properties of scale-space approaches.

Method: Introduces skeletonisation scale-spaces that leverage sparsification of the medial axis, providing both continuous and discrete formulations. Also extends with densification for inverse progression from coarse to fine scales.

Result: The framework satisfies key scale-space properties (hierarchical architecture, controllable simplification, geometric equivariance) and enables robust skeletonisation, shape compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: The proposed skeletonisation scale-spaces provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for hierarchical shape simplification that goes beyond conventional pruning and can produce overcomplete shape representations with practical applications.

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

*Petr Košťál,Pavel Kordík,Ondřej Podsztavek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using single-image super-resolution models to downscale low-resolution climate projections from 12.5 km to 1 km resolution, trained on observational data and evaluated using climate indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution climate projections are needed for local decision-making, but current projections have low spatial resolution (12.5 km) which limits their usability.

Method: Train single-image super-resolution models on high-resolution observational gridded data, then apply them to low-resolution climate projections. Use climate indicator-based assessment with observed climate indices from weather stations for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on daily mean temperature show that super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution projections.

Conclusion: Single-image super-resolution models are effective for statistically downscaling climate projections to higher resolution when high-resolution training data is unavailable.

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

*Md Jueal Mia,M. Hadi Amini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JaiLIP is a jailbreaking attack method that uses loss-guided image perturbations to make Vision-Language Models generate harmful outputs while maintaining imperceptible modifications to images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are vulnerable to image-based attacks that can bypass safety alignments, and existing jailbreaking methods have unstable performance and visible perturbations.

Method: Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP) minimizes a joint objective combining MSE loss between clean/adversarial images and the model's harmful-output loss.

Result: JaiLIP generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images that outperform existing methods in producing toxicity, as measured by Perspective API and Detoxify metrics.

Conclusion: Image-based jailbreak attacks pose practical challenges for VLMs, highlighting the need for efficient defense mechanisms to protect against such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge compared automated plant identification systems with human botanical experts, finding that deep learning models now approach human expert performance levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the gap between automated species identification systems and human expertise, as even experts can be uncertain or disagree when identifying organisms from visual observations.

Method: Evaluated 19 deep-learning systems from 4 research teams against 9 expert botanists specializing in French flora through the ExpertCLEF challenge framework.

Result: State-of-the-art deep learning models achieved performance levels close to the most advanced human expertise in plant identification.

Conclusion: Automated plant identification using deep learning has reached near-human expert performance, representing significant progress in the field.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

*Jian Liu,Chunshi Wang,Song Guo,Haohan Weng,Zhen Zhou,Zhiqi Li,Jiaao Yu,Yiling Zhu,Jing Xu,Biwen Lei,Zhuo Chen,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadGPT is the first autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes end-to-end, using unified tokenization for mixed topologies and RL fine-tuning to surpass triangle-to-quad conversion methods in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate quad meshes by first creating triangle meshes then merging them, which produces poor topology. There's a need for native quad-mesh generation that directly creates high-quality quadrilateral meshes.

Method: QuadGPT uses an autoregressive framework with sequence prediction, featuring: 1) unified tokenization for handling mixed triangle/quad topologies, and 2) specialized Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method called tDPO for improved generation quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show QuadGPT significantly outperforms previous triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and topological quality.

Conclusion: QuadGPT establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining large-scale autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

### [137] [DyME: Dynamic Multi-Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Bi-Level Orthogonal LoRA Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21433)
*Jiaqi Liu,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME is a dynamic multi-concept erasure framework for diffusion models that uses lightweight LoRA adapters with orthogonality constraints to selectively remove copyrighted styles and concepts on-demand, outperforming static erasure methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods don't scale to practical multi-concept settings and use static fine-tuning that degrades performance when erasure needs vary per generation, creating a mismatch with real-world usage.

Method: Train concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically compose only needed ones at inference, with bi-level orthogonality constraints at feature and parameter levels to prevent interference between adapters.

Result: DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic, modular approach with orthogonality constraints enables effective multi-concept erasure in diffusion models, addressing scalability and interference issues in practical settings.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge is a 3B/7B MLLM specialized for evaluating video understanding models, outperforming larger baselines and showing video inputs are crucial for accurate assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture human judgment nuances for video understanding, while manual evaluation is costly. LLM/MLLM evaluators for video tasks remain underexplored.

Method: Training uses generator-evaluator interplay: generator produces responses conditioned on target ratings, and mismatched responses are discarded. Focuses on specialized MLLM architecture for video evaluation.

Result: VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM baselines (Qwen2.5-VL 32B/72B) on 3 out of 4 benchmarks. LLM judges perform worse than MLLM judges, and chain-of-thought reasoning doesn't help, confirming video inputs are essential.

Conclusion: VideoJudge demonstrates that specialized MLLM judges can effectively evaluate video understanding models, and video inputs are crucial for accurate assessment rather than relying solely on text or reasoning.

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom is a learned feature codec for multi-agent collaborative perception that achieves 273x to 1365x compression (6-30 bpp) while preserving spatial identity and maintaining accuracy through residual vector quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication bandwidth constraints limit scalability in multi-agent collaborative perception systems like autonomous vehicles and robots, requiring efficient compression methods.

Method: End-to-end feature compression using a bottleneck network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ), transmitting only per-pixel code indices instead of full features.

Result: Achieves 273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp on DAIR-V2X dataset, matching or outperforming raw-feature CP at 18 bpp with graceful degradation at lower bitrates.

Conclusion: ReVQom enables efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with ultra-low-bandwidth operation, advancing practical V2X deployment.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-Image AI models show strong gender stereotyping and cultural inaccuracies when generating Saudi professionals, with DALL-E V3 showing the most bias (96% male outputs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how contemporary AI models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies in depictions of Saudi professionals.

Method: Analyzed 1,006 images from ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 Saudi professions using neutral prompts, with two Saudi annotators evaluating each image on five dimensions and a third researcher adjudicating disagreements.

Result: Strong gender imbalance across all models: ImageFX 85% male, Grok 86.6% male, DALL-E V3 96% male. Cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and activities were common. Counter-stereotypical images often resulted from cultural misinterpretations.

Conclusion: Current AI models mirror societal biases from training data and offer limited reflection of Saudi labor market realities. Need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model pretraining paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection in short videos, addressing distribution gaps and complex issue definitions through three targeted tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short video platforms need better inappropriate content detection. Existing approaches require separate models for each issue type, need extensive human-labeled data, and lack cross-issue generalization.

Method: Proposed three pretraining tasks: Caption (enhance video detail perception), Visual Question Answering (deepen understanding of issue definitions), and Chain-of-Thought (enhance reasoning capability).

Result: Pretraining approach significantly improves MLLM performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning settings. Model shows strong generalization to emergent, previously unseen issues.

Conclusion: The reasoning-enhanced MLLM pretraining paradigm effectively addresses inappropriate content detection in short videos, overcoming distribution gaps and enabling unified detection across multiple issues.

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reframes GUI grounding as an interactive search task using cursor movement instead of direct coordinate prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coordinate prediction methods fail with high-resolution GUI images and complex layouts. VLMs struggle to predict accurate numeric coordinates in such scenarios.

Method: Interactive search approach where VLM generates actions to move cursor toward target UI elements. Uses multi-step reinforcement learning with dense trajectory-based rewards and visual feedback from rendered cursor.

Result: GUI-Cursor improves accuracy from 88.8% to 93.9% on ScreenSpot-v2 and from 26.8% to 56.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Solves 95% of instances within two steps and adapts step count based on difficulty.

Conclusion: Interactive search paradigm with cursor movement is more effective than direct coordinate prediction for GUI grounding, enabling better spatial reasoning and visual feedback alignment.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: X-CoT is an explainable text-to-video retrieval framework that replaces traditional embedding-based similarity ranking with LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning, providing detailed explanations for ranking results while improving retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video retrieval systems have two key limitations: they are vulnerable to low-quality text-video data pairs that are hard to identify, and cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for ranking results, limiting interpretability.

Method: Proposes X-CoT framework that uses LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning instead of embedding model-based similarity ranking. Expands benchmarks with additional video annotations for better semantic understanding and reduced data bias. Devises a retrieval CoT with pairwise comparison steps that produces detailed reasoning and complete ranking.

Result: X-CoT empirically improves retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates model behavior and data quality analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed X-CoT framework successfully addresses interpretability limitations in text-to-video retrieval while improving performance, enabling better assessment of retrieval models and examination of text-video data quality.

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

### [144] [Unsupervised Defect Detection for Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21561)
*Joseph Huang,Yichi Zhang,Jingxi Yu,Wei Chen,Seunghyun Hwang,Qiang Qiu,Amy R. Reibman,Edward J. Delp,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to adapt unsupervised defect detection for surgical instruments, addressing issues like false positives from textured backgrounds and poor sensitivity to small defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of surgical instruments is error-prone, and existing automated methods trained on natural/industrial images fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain due to domain shift and other limitations.

Method: Integrates background masking, patch-based analysis strategy, and efficient domain adaptation to adapt unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical instruments.

Result: Overcomes limitations of existing approaches, enabling reliable detection of fine-grained defects in surgical instrument imagery.

Conclusion: The proposed versatile method successfully addresses domain-specific challenges in surgical instrument defect detection.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

### [145] [No Alignment Needed for Generation: Learning Linearly Separable Representations in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21565)
*Junno Yun,Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LSEP regularization for diffusion models that promotes linear separability of intermediate representations, eliminating need for external encoders while improving training efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment-based approaches depend on computationally expensive pretrained encoders for representation alignment. LSEP provides an alternative that avoids this dependency.

Method: Introduces Linear SEParability (LSEP) regularization that incorporates linear probing directly into training dynamics, promoting linear separability of intermediate layer representations without auxiliary encoders.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in training efficiency and generation quality, with FID of 1.46 on 256×256 ImageNet dataset using flow-based transformer architectures like SiTs.

Conclusion: LSEP provides an effective alternative to encoder-dependent alignment methods, improving representation quality while reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

### [146] [Enhancing Contrastive Learning for Geolocalization by Discovering Hard Negatives on Semivariograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21573)
*Boyi Chen,Zhangyu Wang,Fabian Deuser,Johann Maximilian Zollner,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spatially regularized contrastive learning method that integrates semivariogram modeling to address false negatives and hard negatives in image-based geo-localization, improving performance especially at finer granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods for image-based geo-localization neglect spatial dependencies, leading to issues with false negatives (visually/geographically similar images labeled as negatives) and hard negatives (visually similar but geographically distant images).

Method: A novel spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates semivariogram - a geostatistical tool that models spatial correlation changes with distance. The semivariogram relates feature space distance to geographical distance to capture expected visual content in spatial correlation.

Result: The method was integrated into GeoCLIP and evaluated on OSV5M dataset, showing improved image-based geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling spatial priors through semivariogram-based regularization enhances contrastive learning for geo-localization by better handling spatial dependencies and improving discrimination of challenging cases.

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

TL;DR: X-Streamer is an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling framework that enables real-time, open-ended video calls from a single portrait using a unified Thinker-Actor dual-transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build digital human agents capable of infinite interactions across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture, enabling persistent and intelligent audiovisual interactions from static portraits.

Method: Thinker-Actor dual-transformer architecture: Thinker module (pretrained large language-speech model) perceives streaming inputs, Actor module (chunk-wise autoregressive diffusion model) generates synchronized multimodal responses. Uses inter/intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned multimodal positional embeddings, chunk-wise diffusion forcing, and global identity referencing.

Result: X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs, sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary portraits with fine-grained cross-modality alignment.

Conclusion: The framework paves the way toward unified world modeling of interactive digital humans by enabling real-time, persistent multimodal interactions from static portraits.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

*Gabrijel Boduljak,Laurynas Karazija,Iro Laina,Christian Rupprecht,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for forecasting object motion from single images by generating dense trajectory grids instead of pixels, achieving better accuracy and diversity than prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict how objects will move from a single image without observing velocities or forces, addressing the limitations of video generators that struggle with motion forecasting despite being considered world models.

Method: Formulate motion forecasting as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids using an architecture similar to modern video generators, but outputting motion trajectories instead of pixels to directly model motion.

Result: The approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. It shows effectiveness on robotics applications and promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets.

Conclusion: Directly modeling motion through trajectory grids is more effective for motion forecasting than pixel-based video generation, as video generators struggle with this task even in simple physical scenarios due to the overhead of pixel generation.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of DINOv3 (spatial) vs V-JEPA2 (temporal) self-supervised architectures for video action recognition on UCF Sports dataset, revealing trade-offs between spatial pose recognition and temporal motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand architectural trade-offs between spatial feature extraction (DINOv3) and temporal modeling (V-JEPA2) for video action recognition, providing empirical guidance for method selection based on task requirements.

Method: Evaluated both approaches on UCF Sports dataset using multiple metrics: classification accuracy, clustering performance (Silhouette score), intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Conducted action-specific analysis to assess performance across different action types.

Result: DINOv3 achieved superior clustering (Silhouette: 0.31 vs 0.21) and exceptional discrimination (6.16x separation ratio) for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 showed consistent reliability with lower variance (0.094 vs 0.288). DINOv3 excels at static pose recognition but degrades on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2 provides balanced performance across action categories.

Conclusion: Architectural choices present fundamental trade-offs: spatial processing excels for pose recognition while temporal modeling provides balanced reliability. Findings guide selection of appropriate feature extraction methods based on specific task requirements and reliability constraints in video analysis systems.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCE is a multimodal system that generates comprehensive disaster damage descriptions from satellite and UAV imagery using dual CNN-LSTM and Vision Transformer architectures enhanced with external semantic knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage assessment methods are slow and dangerous after disasters, while current computer vision approaches only provide limited outputs like classification labels or segmentation masks, lacking comprehensive situational understanding.

Method: Uses dual architecture: CNN-LSTM with ResNet50 backbone for satellite imagery (xBD dataset) and Vision Transformer for UAV images (RescueNet dataset), both enhanced with external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet.

Result: VLCE significantly outperforms baseline models (LLaVA and QwenVL), achieving up to 95.33% on InfoMetIC for caption informativeness while maintaining competitive semantic alignment measured by CLIPScore.

Conclusion: The dual-architecture system shows strong potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the generation of actionable, information-rich descriptions from satellite and drone imagery.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a principled framework using representational similarity metrics and Similarity Network Fusion to analyze and classify vision models, revealing that geometry and tuning carry family-specific signatures while linearly decodable information is broadly shared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which aspects of vision model representations are shared across different architectures and training paradigms versus which reflect distinctive computational strategies, since current methods lack principled analysis of representational structure.

Method: Used a suite of representational similarity metrics (RSA, Soft Matching, Linear Predictivity) capturing different facets of representations, then integrated them using Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) - a multi-omics inspired method - to create composite signatures for clustering analysis.

Result: Geometry and tuning metrics strongly discriminate model families, while linear decodability shows weaker separation. SNF achieved substantially sharper family separation than individual metrics. Clustering revealed supervised ResNets and ViTs form distinct clusters, self-supervised models group across architectures, and hybrid architectures cluster with masked autoencoders.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled typology showing that emergent computational strategies - shaped jointly by architecture and training objective - define representational structure beyond surface design categories, with convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training.

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

TL;DR: FantasyWorld is a geometry-enhanced framework that integrates 3D geometric priors into frozen video foundation models, enabling joint modeling of video and 3D fields for consistent 3D-aware video generation and versatile 3D representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, limiting their spatial consistency and utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks like AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation.

Method: Augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch for joint modeling of video latents and implicit 3D field in a single forward pass, using cross-branch supervision where geometry guides video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction.

Result: Outperforms recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency, with geometric branch latents serving as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks without per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception through unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange, enabling consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations.

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Pretrained on diverse PDE datasets and evaluated with fine-tuning and LoRA adapters.

Result: MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization, matching or surpassing strong baselines and state-of-the-art models across extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: MORPH presents a powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable

Motivation: Infrared imaging is effective for urban object detection in low-light conditions, but faces challenges like class imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints that hinder practical deployment.

Method: Selected YOLOv8 as baseline, replaced CSPDarknet with MobileNetV4 backbone for efficiency, and introduced SlideLoss function to dynamically emphasize underrepresented and occluded samples.

Result: MS-YOLO reduces computational overhead by 1.5% while sustaining high accuracy, achieves competitive mAP and superior precision on FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark with only 6.7 GFLOPs.

Conclusion: MS-YOLO effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality while minimizing computational costs, making it suitable for real-time edge deployment in urban environments.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge

TL;DR: MATR introduces motion-aware transformer for multi-object tracking that explicitly predicts object movements to update track queries in advance, reducing query conflicts and improving both detection and association performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DETR-based MOT frameworks process detection and tracking queries jointly in single Transformer Decoder layers, causing conflicts and degraded association accuracy.

Method: Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR) explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance, reducing query collisions and enabling more consistent training.

Result: Significant improvements across DanceTrack (71.3 HOTA), SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA), and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6 mHOTA), achieving state-of-the-art results without external datasets.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking performance.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR is an efficient video deraining method that uses Lie group differential biases in attention scores to address rain streaks, blur, noise, and temporal artifacts in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video deraining methods rely on computationally expensive optical flow or heuristic alignment, which are less robust to camera pose changes and cross-frame mismatches.

Method: Proposes two components: rotation-bounded Lie relative bias for geometry-consistent alignment using in-plane angle prediction, and differential group displacement that computes angular differences between frames with temporal decay and attention masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness on publicly available benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lie groups provide a principled way to enforce spatiotemporal consistency in video deraining, enabling efficient and robust performance.

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates foundational AI/ML models for SAR object recognition, showing that while current visual models have limitations, self-supervised fine-tuning with SAR data creates state-of-the-art SAR foundation models that outperform existing SAR-domain models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to apply the transformative power of foundational AI models (trained with SSL on web-scale data) to the SAR domain, leveraging their benefits like limited labeled data requirements, robustness to distribution shift, and transferable features.

Method: The method involves: 1) Testing current visual foundational models (DINOv2, DINOv3, PE-Core) on SAR data, 2) Self-supervised fine-tuning of SSL models with SAR data to create AFRL-DINOv2 models, 3) Analyzing performance trade-offs with different backbones and downstream adaptation recipes.

Result: The results show that self-supervised fine-tuning with SAR data creates state-of-the-art SAR foundation models (AFRL-DINOv2s) that significantly outperform the current best SAR-domain model SARATR-X, while also analyzing performance across different downstream challenges.

Conclusion: While the work demonstrates viability and sets new state-of-the-art results for SAR foundation models, the authors conclude that there's still a long way to go in developing SAR foundation models, hoping this work will inspire future research in this direction.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UISim is an image-based UI simulator that generates realistic mobile interface transitions using a two-stage approach: predicting abstract layouts from screen images and then synthesizing new UI states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for UI testing and AI agent training rely on physical devices or static screenshot analysis, which are not scalable for dynamic mobile environments.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Predict abstract layout of next UI state from initial screen image and user action, 2) Synthesize visually consistent new image based on predicted layout.

Result: UISim outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, demonstrating high fidelity.

Conclusion: UISim provides practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, synthetic data generation, and enables advanced applications like UI navigation task planning for AI agents.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational

network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,
STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of

### [160] [Incorporating Scene Context and Semantic Labels for Enhanced Group-level Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21747)
*Qing Zhu,Wangdong Guo,Qirong Mao,Xiaohua Huang,Xiuyan Shao,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for group-level emotion recognition that integrates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information using multi-scale scene encoding and LLM-generated emotion lexicons refined through a structured emotion tree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods underestimate visual scene contextual information for modeling individual relationships and overlook semantic information from emotional labels for complete emotion understanding.

Method: Proposes visual context encoding module with multi-scale scene information, emotion semantic encoding module using LLM-generated emotion lexicons refined via structured emotion tree, and similarity-aware interaction to align visual and semantic information.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted GER datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves GER performance by incorporating both visual scene context and label-guided semantic information through novel encoding and interaction mechanisms.

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Yu Li,Da Chang,Xi Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-SAM enhances the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical imaging by integrating anatomical knowledge graphs, boundary refinement via CRF, and uncertainty estimation, achieving superior segmentation performance on multi-center datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of SAM to medical imaging faces challenges like ambiguous boundaries, lack of anatomical relationship modeling, and absence of uncertainty quantification, which are critical for clinical reliability.

Method: KG-SAM integrates: (i) medical knowledge graph for anatomical relationships, (ii) energy-based CRF for anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) uncertainty-aware fusion module for reliability.

Result: Achieved average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate segmentation and substantial gains in abdominal segmentation: 78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT across multi-center datasets.

Conclusion: KG-SAM establishes a robust and generalizable framework that effectively addresses medical imaging challenges by combining anatomical priors with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

### [162] [UniVid: Unifying Vision Tasks with Pre-trained Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21760)
*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid is a framework that fine-tunes a pre-trained video diffusion transformer to handle diverse vision tasks using visual sentences, enabling cross-modal inference and cross-source task generalization without task-specific pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more unified and scalable alternative to task-specific pre-training across modalities by leveraging pre-trained video generation models that inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies.

Method: Fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to represent tasks as visual sentences, where context sequences define both the task and output modality, allowing cross-modal inference and cross-source task handling.

Result: UniVid generalizes well to cross-modal inference (images and videos) and cross-source tasks (natural to annotated data) despite being trained only on natural video data, with understanding and generation tasks easily switchable by reversing visual sentence order.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video generation models have strong potential to serve as scalable and unified foundation models for vision modeling, enabling flexible task adaptation without extensive multi-modal pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

### [163] [CubistMerge: Spatial-Preserving Token Merging For Diverse ViT Backbones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21764)
*Wenyi Gong,Mieszko Lis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A token merging method that preserves spatial structure for modern ViT backbones with spatial designs like window attention and RoPE, enabling compatibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods fail to preserve spatial structure required by modern ViT architectures with spatial designs like window attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings, and RoPE.

Method: Uses 2D reduction strategy for structured token layouts, spatial-aware merging algorithm to maintain relative positions, and max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation to preserve salient features.

Result: Achieves 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet after one fine-tuning epoch.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively maintains spatial integrity while enabling token reduction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across spatial and non-spatial architectures for various vision tasks.

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GASP-ICL is a training-free framework for multimodal deepfake detection that enhances large vision-language models by retrieving aligned image-text pairs and using a graph-structured scorer to select discriminative exemplars for in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models have strong multimodal reasoning but struggle with capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval in multimodal deepfake detection.

Method: Proposes GASP-ICL framework with MDD-adapted feature extractor for aligned image-text pair retrieval and Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer (GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals for selecting discriminative exemplars.

Result: Experiments on four forgery types show GASP-ICL surpasses strong baselines and delivers performance gains without requiring LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GASP-ICL effectively enhances LVLMs for robust multimodal deepfake detection through semantic alignment and task-aware knowledge injection in a training-free manner.

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ProDA is a novel framework that disentangles specified actions from multi-action scenes using spatio-temporal scene graphs and dynamic prompts to generate action-specific representations for improved video action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods extract unified features for all actions in videos, which makes it challenging to model interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. The paper aims to address this by disentangling specified actions from complex scenes.

Method: ProDA uses Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. It also designs a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.

Result: Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of ProDA when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ProDA framework effectively disentangles specified actions from multi-action scenes and shows promising performance in video action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.

Conclusion: The approach contributes to more ethical AI applications in social media by providing effective tools for detecting and removing hateful content from digital images.

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual
prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in
social media.

Conclusion: MIRG-RL effectively addresses cross-image reasoning challenges in LVLMs through its unified framework and two-stage training approach, setting new benchmarks for multi-image understanding tasks.

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongScape is a hybrid video generation framework that combines diffusion denoising with autoregressive generation using action-guided chunking and Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts to achieve stable long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods struggle with stable long-horizon generation - diffusion-based approaches suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual drift, while autoregressive methods compromise visual detail, limiting their effectiveness for generating high-quality embodied manipulation data.

Method: Hybrid framework combining intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation. Uses action-guided variable-length chunking based on robotic action semantics, and Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) that adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves stable and consistent long-horizon generation over extended rollouts, addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: LongScape successfully enables stable long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation through its hybrid approach and adaptive chunking mechanism, providing high-quality visual output with temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation world models suffer from visual redundancies that hinder action decoding, while latent world models overlook fine-grained details needed for precise manipulation.

Method: Fuses representations from hybrid world models - uses motion-aware latent representations as high-level prior to guide extraction of fine-grained visual features from pixel space model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization on CALVIN benchmark.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines the strengths of different feature spaces for embodied planning, providing valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTraj is a training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT), featuring foreground-background separation guidance and inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE to enhance trajectory control without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory control methods either require substantial training resources or are designed for U-Net architectures, failing to leverage the superior performance of DiT models in video generation.

Method: Proposes foreground-background separation using LLMs to guide generation, and STD-RoPE that modifies foreground tokens' position embedding to eliminate cross-frame spatial discrepancies and strengthen attention for better trajectory control.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiTraj outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.

Conclusion: DiTraj provides an effective training-free solution for trajectory control in DiT-based video generation, achieving superior performance through innovative position embedding modifications and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid retrieval combining dense embeddings with lexical overlap and re-ranking substantially outperforms baseline methods for multi-hop QA, achieving 50% EM and 47% F1 improvement over cosine similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop reasoning requiring evidence combination across multiple passages remains challenging for transformer-based QA models, necessitating better retrieval strategies.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of retrieval strategies (cosine similarity, MMR, hybrid method) within RAG framework, adapting EfficientRAG pipeline with token labeling and iterative refinement.

Result: Hybrid approach achieves 50% EM and 47% F1 improvement over cosine similarity on HotpotQA, with better entity recall and evidence complementarity.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides practical zero-shot solution for multi-hop QA, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

*Kaixuan Zhang,Zhipeng Xiong,Minxian Li,Mingwu Ren,Jiankang Deng,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HDR-4DGS enables High Dynamic Range novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes by jointly modeling temporal radiance variations and 3D translation between LDR and HDR domains using Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HDR NVS methods focus on static scenes, but real-world scenarios often contain dynamic elements like moving objects and varying lighting, creating a more challenging problem that existing approaches cannot handle.

Method: Proposed HDR-4DGS uses Gaussian Splatting with a dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, adapting tone-mapping functions according to evolving radiance distributions across time.

Result: HDR-4DGS achieves temporal radiance consistency and accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in quantitative performance and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed HDR DNVS problem and HDR-4DGS solution successfully address the challenge of dynamic HDR novel view synthesis, demonstrating superior performance for realistic scenarios with temporal variations.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

*Minje Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRHand reconstructs detailed 3D hand geometry and textures from low-resolution images using a geometric-aware implicit image function that combines implicit image representation with explicit hand meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on high-resolution multi-view images and struggle with low-resolution inputs. Existing super-resolution methods work only for static objects, not articulated hands.

Method: Proposes geometric-aware implicit image function (GIIF) that learns hand priors by upsampling coarse images. Jointly optimizes implicit image function and explicit 3D hand shapes to maintain multi-view and pose consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling and 3D hand reconstruction methods on InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, achieving fine details like wrinkles and nails.

Conclusion: SRHand enables detailed 3D hand reconstruction from low-resolution images by combining implicit image representation with explicit geometric constraints, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

*Janis Keuper,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper argues that current fake image detection research focuses too much on generative models while neglecting proper definition and collection of "real" images, especially given modern smartphone photography uses neural networks similar to fake image generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in fake image detection research by highlighting the need to redefine "real" images in the era of computational photography where smartphones use neural networks to process images.

Method: Position paper analyzing current limitations in fake detection research, particularly the reliance on outdated datasets and lack of clear definition for "real" images given modern computational photography.

Result: Identifies fundamental flaws in current fake detection approaches that use old low-resolution datasets while ignoring that modern "real" photos are computationally processed by neural networks similar to fake generators.

Conclusion: Calls for rethinking the concept of "real" images, developing clear technical definitions, creating new benchmark datasets, and questioning whether fake detection is a sound objective given the convergence of real and fake image generation technologies.

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aes-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that improves multimodal LLMs' aesthetic assessment by generating interpretable rationales and accurate scores through structured reasoning and joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs struggle with aesthetic assessment due to scarcity of reasoning data and subjective nature of aesthetic judgments, making it hard to generate accurate scores with interpretable explanations.

Method: Uses AesCoT pipeline to construct chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data, then applies Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO) RL algorithm to jointly optimize absolute score regression and relative ranking order.

Result: Improves backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size, with robust generalization in limited supervision and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

*Liyang Chen,Tianze Zhou,Xu He,Boshi Tang,Zhiyong Wu,Yang Huang,Yang Wu,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableDub is a novel visual dubbing framework that addresses two key limitations: inadequate speaker-specific lip habit modeling and poor occlusion handling. It integrates lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis using Stable-Diffusion backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual dubbing methods have two critical deficiencies: (1) audio-only driving fails to capture speaker-specific lip habits, and (2) conventional blind-inpainting produces visual artifacts when handling obstructions like microphones or hands, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Built on Stable-Diffusion backbone, StableDub develops a lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. It introduces occlusion-aware training by explicitly exposing occlusion objects to the inpainting process, and uses a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture for training efficiency.

Result: StableDub achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion robustness, surpassing other methods in audio-lip sync, video quality, and resolution consistency. It eliminates the need for cost-intensive priors and exhibits superior training efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key limitations in visual dubbing by integrating lip-habit modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis, expanding the applicability of visual dubbing methods while maintaining training efficiency.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drag4D is an interactive framework for text-driven 3D scene generation with object motion control, enabling users to define 3D trajectories for objects and integrate them into high-quality 3D backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interactive control over object motion within text-driven 3D scene generation, allowing users to define 3D trajectories for objects and seamlessly integrate them into generated 3D environments.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Enhanced text-to-3D background generation using 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and inpainted novel views; 2) 3D copy-and-paste approach using off-the-shelf image-to-3D model for object extraction and physics-aware object position learning; 3) Temporal animation using part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model with multiview image pairs and projected 2D trajectories.

Result: The framework achieves harmonized alignment of user-controlled object motion within high-quality 3D backgrounds, effectively mitigating motion hallucination and ensuring view-consistent temporal alignment.

Conclusion: Drag4D provides a unified architecture for interactive 3D scene generation with precise object motion control, demonstrating effective integration of object trajectories into generated 3D environments through its three-stage pipeline.

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony generates high-resolution videos synchronized with audio using motion-aware loss and audio sync guidance, outperforming existing methods in both synchronization and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-to-video models struggle with fine-grained synchronization due to indirect conditioning or limited temporal modeling, while audio provides natural temporal cues for video motion control.

Method: Builds on pre-trained video backbone with two key components: Motion-aware Loss emphasizing high-motion regions, and Audio Sync Guidance using an off-sync model to better exploit audio cues while maintaining visual quality.

Result: Generates 380x640 resolution, 24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs, outperforming existing methods on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets in both synchronization accuracy and visual quality.

Conclusion: Syncphony effectively addresses audio-video synchronization challenges through specialized loss functions and guidance mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance in generating temporally controlled videos from audio inputs.

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LG-CD is a novel language-guided change detection model that uses text prompts to direct attention to regions of interest, improving accuracy and robustness in remote sensing change detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning methods focus only on visual information and neglect the rich semantic information from multimodal data like text, limiting change detection performance.

Method: Uses SAM2 visual foundation model for multi-scale feature extraction, multi-layer adapters for fine-tuning, Text Fusion Attention Module for visual-text alignment, and Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder with cross-attention for mask generation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and provides new insights for generalized change detection using multimodal information.

Conclusion: LG-CD demonstrates that leveraging multimodal information through language guidance significantly improves change detection accuracy and robustness, opening new possibilities for generalized change detection.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing that combines precise spatial control from drag interactions with fine-grained texture guidance from text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven methods lack precise spatial control while drag-driven approaches lack fine-grained texture guidance. The paper aims to address these complementary limitations by integrating both paradigms.

Method: Proposes two key innovations: Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag for enhanced latent-space layout control through 3D feature mapping, and Drag-Text Guided Denoising that dynamically balances drag and text conditions during denoising.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity joint editing and matches or surpasses specialized text-only or drag-only approaches. It supports flexible editing modes (text-only, drag-only, or combined) while maintaining strong performance in each setting.

Conclusion: Establishes a versatile and generalizable solution for controllable image manipulation that integrates the strengths of both text-driven and drag-driven editing paradigms.

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection in Nordic UAV images faces visibility challenges and domain shifts from snow coverage. Annotated data is expensive but unannotated data is cheap to obtain by flying drones.

Method: Train CNN-based representation extractor via contrastive learning on unannotated data, then sideload it to frozen YOLO11n backbone during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments compare fusion methods and granularity.

Result: Improves detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in mAP50 on NVD dataset.

Conclusion: Sideload-CL-adaptation effectively leverages unannotated data to enhance vehicle detection performance in challenging Nordic conditions.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods either require inversion with model-specific design or extensive optimization, limiting their ability to leverage up-to-date image-to-video models for transferring image editing capabilities to videos.

Method: Uses Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate source video information into denoising, Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization for motion-aware noise generation, and Deviation Caching to minimize computational cost.

Result: The method achieves superior editing quality and consistency compared to existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: IF-V2V provides an effective inversion-free approach for video editing that can adapt existing image-to-video models without significant computational overhead, enabling better video editing capabilities.

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSLCounter is a self-supervised learning framework for multi-view counting that uses neural volumetric rendering to reduce dependency on annotated data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 70% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multi-view counting methods rely on fully supervised learning requiring large annotated datasets, which is resource-intensive. The authors aim to reduce this dependency through self-supervised learning.

Method: The framework learns an implicit scene representation using neural volumetric rendering, enabling reconstruction of continuous geometry and view-dependent appearance through differential neural rendering. The approach can be integrated into existing frameworks.

Result: SSLCounter achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers competitive results using only 70% of training data, demonstrating superior data efficiency across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised learning framework effectively reduces reliance on annotated data while maintaining high performance in multi-view counting tasks.

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural

*Vahid Mirjalili,Ramin Giahi,Sriram Kollipara,Akshay Kekuda,Kehui Yao,Kai Zhao,Jianpeng Xu,Kaushiki Nag,Sinduja Subramaniam,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic benchmark for evaluating object-centric spatial reasoning in vision foundation models, revealing a trade-off between precise localization and relational reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models focus on localization accuracy but lack true spatial understanding of how objects are arranged and related within scenes, which is critical for effective scene understanding.

Method: Used a controlled synthetic dataset to evaluate state-of-the-art vision models and VLMs across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks.

Result: Found a stable trade-off: detectors provide precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs offer coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context.

Conclusion: Highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, emphasizing the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

*Jiahao Zhang,Bowen Wang,Hong Liu,Yuta Nakashima,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANICL is a training-free framework that addresses over-reliance on single in-context pairs in Visual In-Context Learning by using multiple in-context pairs to smooth assignment scores and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual In-Context Learning often suffers from over-reliance on a single in-context pair, leading to biased and unstable predictions.

Method: PAtch-based k-Nearest neighbor visual In-Context Learning (PANICL) leverages multiple in-context pairs to smooth assignment scores across pairs without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on various tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines, with strong robustness to domain shifts and good generalization to other VICL models.

Conclusion: PANICL is a versatile and broadly applicable framework that effectively mitigates bias in Visual In-Context Learning through multi-patch smoothing.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

### [186] [SingRef6D: Monocular Novel Object Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21927)
*Jiahui Wang,Haiyue Zhu,Haoren Guo,Abdullah Al Mamun,Cheng Xiang,Tong Heng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SingRef6D is a lightweight 6D pose estimation method that uses only a single RGB image as reference, eliminating the need for depth sensors or multi-view images. It improves depth prediction for challenging surfaces and integrates depth-aware matching to handle difficult materials and lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods have practical limitations: depth-based methods fail with transparent/reflective surfaces, while RGB-based methods struggle in low-light/texture-less scenes due to lack of geometry information.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Token-scaler-based fine-tuning with novel optimization loss on Depth-Anything v2 for improved depth prediction on challenging surfaces; 2) Depth-aware matching process that integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR for handling difficult materials and lighting.

Result: 14.41% improvement in depth prediction on REAL275 compared to Depth-Anything v2, and 6.1% improvement in average recall for pose estimation across REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light datasets.

Conclusion: SingRef6D provides a robust and capable solution for 6D pose estimation in resource-limited settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while requiring only single RGB images as input.

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for visual navigation suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes DynaNav with trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations and early-exit mechanism with Bayesian Optimization for optimal exit thresholds.

Result: Achieves 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, 32.8% lower memory usage compared to ViNT, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.

Conclusion: DynaNav effectively addresses computational efficiency and interpretability issues in visual navigation through dynamic feature and layer selection.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across
four public datasets.

### [188] [SemanticControl: A Training-Free Approach for Handling Loosely Aligned Visual Conditions in ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21938)
*Woosung Joung,Daewon Chae,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticControl is a training-free method that enables text-to-image diffusion models to effectively use loosely aligned visual conditions (like human poses for animal scenes) by adaptively suppressing conflicting visual guidance and strengthening text guidance using attention masks from surrogate prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet requires precisely aligned visual conditions with text prompts, which is impractical for uncommon or imaginative scenes. Loosely aligned conditions (e.g., human poses for animal scenes) are more available but existing methods struggle with them, causing low text fidelity or artifacts.

Method: Run auxiliary denoising with a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition to extract attention masks, then use these masks during actual target prompt denoising to suppress conflicting visual guidance and strengthen text guidance.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance under loosely aligned conditions across various condition types (depth maps, edge maps, human skeletons), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: SemanticControl effectively addresses the limitation of requiring precisely aligned visual conditions in ControlNet, enabling better utilization of semantically relevant but misaligned visual guides for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Sicheng Zhao,Can Ma,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Emotion Statement Judgment task and automated pipeline to evaluate multimodal LLMs' emotion perception from images, revealing performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MLLMs' emotion perception have limitations including oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations.

Method: Developed an Emotion Statement Judgment task and an automated pipeline to efficiently construct emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort for systematic evaluation.

Result: MLLMs show stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, but have limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. Top-performing models like GPT4o still show significant gaps compared to humans.

Conclusion: The work provides a fundamental evaluation framework that contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs by identifying key areas for improvement.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

*Tao Wu,Yibo Jiang,Yehao Lu,Zhizhong Wang,Zeyi Huang,Zequn Qin,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiCrafter is a framework for multi-subject image generation that addresses attribute leakage and human preference alignment through positional supervision, Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and online reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject image generation methods suffer from severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives.

Method: Introduces explicit positional supervision to separate attention regions, employs Mixture-of-Experts architecture for scenario-specific planning, and designs an online reinforcement learning framework with specialized scoring and training strategies for MoE.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in subject fidelity and better alignment with human preferences compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MultiCrafter effectively addresses key limitations in multi-subject image generation by mitigating attribute leakage through attention separation and aligning outputs with human preferences via reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartSAM is the first promptable 3D part segmentation model trained on large-scale 3D data, overcoming limitations of 2D-based approaches by using a triplane-based dual-branch encoder and achieving superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing open-world part segmentation methods that transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, which fail to capture intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled decomposition, and limited generalization.

Method: PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder architecture with a triplane-based dual-branch encoder that produces spatially structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. The model is trained on over five million 3D shape-part pairs curated through a model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline from online assets.

Result: PartSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, achieving highly accurate part identification with a single prompt and automatically decomposing shapes into both surface and internal structures in Segment-Every-Part mode.

Conclusion: PartSAM represents a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding, demonstrating emergent open-world capabilities through its scalable architecture and diverse 3D data training.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for blind contrast quality assessment using customized pre-trained models (EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, MobileNetV2) achieves state-of-the-art performance in evaluating contrast distortions without reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most no-reference image quality assessment models struggle to accurately evaluate contrast distortions under diverse real-world conditions, despite contrast being a fundamental factor in visual perception and image quality.

Method: Customized and fine-tuned three pre-trained architectures (EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, MobileNetV2) with contrast-aware regression heads, trained end-to-end using targeted data augmentations on benchmark datasets CID2013 and CCID2014 containing synthetic and authentic contrast distortions.

Result: EfficientNet B0 achieved state-of-the-art performance with PLCC=0.9286/SRCC=0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC=0.9581/SRCC=0.9369 on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and other deep baselines. Siamese network showed limited ability to capture perceptual contrast distortions.

Conclusion: Contrast-aware adaptation of lightweight pre-trained networks provides a high-performing, scalable solution for no-reference contrast quality assessment suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

TL;DR: Geo-R1 is a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring that generates explicit reasoning chains before localizing objects, improving performance and generalization with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning struggles with poor generalization in data-scarce scenarios for remote sensing referring expression understanding, which requires complex object-context reasoning.

Method: Proposes a "reason first, then act" process where the model generates interpretable reasoning chains to decompose referring expressions, then uses these rationales to localize target objects through reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Geo-R1 consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines on three few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: The reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm enables more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability for geospatial referring tasks.

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates clinical sycophancy in medical VLMs, creates a benchmark dataset, shows models are vulnerable to sycophantic triggers, and proposes VIPER mitigation framework to reduce sycophancy while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision language models in clinical workflows often prioritize alignment with user phrasing and social cues over evidence-based reasoning, which poses risks for medical decision-making.

Method: Created medical sycophancy benchmark from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD datasets using psychologically motivated pressure templates. Proposed VIPER framework that filters non-evidentiary content and generates evidence-first answers.

Result: VLMs are vulnerable to sycophantic behavior with significant variation in adversarial responses, weakly correlated to model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert corrections were most effective triggers, suggesting bias mechanisms independent of visual evidence.

Conclusion: The benchmark and VIPER mitigation framework provide groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real-world clinician interactions, emphasizing the need for evidence-anchored defenses against sycophantic behavior.

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for

TL;DR: GLARIFY is a novel method that leverages spatiotemporal gaze information to enhance Vision-Language Models' effectiveness in handling ambiguous queries from smart glasses users, addressing noisy gaze patterns and complex spatiotemporal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With smart glasses gaining popularity, users' attention integration into VLMs faces challenges: ambiguous verbal queries using pronouns or skipping context, and noisy gaze patterns with complex spatiotemporal relationships. Previous methods using single images fail to capture dynamic attention.

Method: Analyzed gaze modality samples, used GPT-4o to create automatic data synthesis pipeline generating GLARIFY-Ambi dataset with chain-of-thought process for noisy gaze handling, and designed heatmap module to incorporate gaze information into VLMs while preserving pretrained knowledge.

Result: GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines on hold-out test set, demonstrating improved effectiveness in handling ambiguous queries with gaze data.

Conclusion: GLARIFY robustly aligns VLMs with human attention, paving the way for usable and intuitive interaction paradigms with visual assistants in smart glasses applications.

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

### [196] [From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984)
*Yingjie Zhu,Xuefeng Bai,Kehai Chen,Yang Xiang,Weili Guan,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies spatial bias in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) where identical visual information placed at different image locations produces inconsistent outputs, and proposes Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA) to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs show inconsistent performance when identical visual information appears at different spatial locations, revealing a fundamental limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding that needs to be addressed.

Method: The authors introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens to promote balanced integration of visual information across different spatial positions.

Result: BaPA enhances spatial robustness of LVLMs without retraining and further boosts performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. It yields balanced attention for more holistic visual understanding.

Conclusion: The spatial bias in LVLMs originates from unbalanced position embedding designs in the language model component, and BaPA effectively mitigates this issue by enabling more balanced cross-modal interaction.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

*Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Aleksandar Cvejic,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel approach to disentangle visual and semantic features from pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual correspondence and proposing a new metric VSM to quantify visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion model backbones encode both semantic and visual features, but isolating visual features is challenging due to lack of annotated datasets. Need to enable visual correspondence analogous to semantic correspondence.

Method: Automated pipeline to construct image pairs with annotated semantic/visual correspondences from existing datasets, plus contrastive architecture to separate feature types. Uses disentangled representations for VSM metric.

Result: Outperforms CLIP, DINO, and vision-language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. First method supporting both quantification and localization.

Conclusion: Provides valuable tool for advancing subject-driven generation by offering comprehensive inconsistency analysis through the proposed VSM metric and feature disentanglement approach.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

*Changli Tang,Qinfan Xiao,Ke Mei,Tianyi Wang,Fengyun Rao,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAVE introduces unified audio-visual embeddings using LLMs, enabling any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and prompt-aware embeddings through hierarchical feature fusion and multi-task training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLM embeddings are effective for general representations but underexplored for dynamic modalities like audio and video, creating a need for unified cross-modal representations.

Method: Uses hierarchical feature fusion strategy and joint multi-modal, multi-task training to create unified embeddings for text, audio, and video modalities.

Result: Sets new SOTA on MMEB-v2 video benchmark, achieves superior audio/video-to-audio retrieval, and significantly outperforms existing models in multimodal QA through prompt-aware embeddings.

Conclusion: WAVE enables broad cross-modal applications through unified representations, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of the joint training approach.

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

*Jewon Lee,Wooksu Shin,Seungmin Yang,Ki-Ung Song,DongUk Lim,Jaeyeon Kim,Tae-Ho Kim,Bo-Kyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERGO proposes a two-stage coarse-to-fine reasoning pipeline that first analyzes downsampled images to identify task-relevant regions, then processes only those regions at full resolution, reducing computational costs while preserving visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Vision-Language Models incur substantial computational overhead due to processing large numbers of vision tokens, especially for high-resolution images. The emergence of "thinking with images" models enables visual reasoning that can guide efficient processing.

Method: ERGO uses a reasoning-driven perception approach that leverages multimodal context to determine where to focus. It accounts for perceptual uncertainty by expanding cropped regions to cover visually ambiguous areas, using reinforcement learning with simple reward components for coarse-to-fine perception.

Result: ERGO achieves higher accuracy than original models and competitive methods with greater efficiency. It surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of vision tokens, achieving 3x inference speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed coarse-to-fine reasoning pipeline with reasoning-driven perception effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining or improving accuracy, making it suitable for efficient real-world vision-language applications.

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

### [200] [DualFocus: Depth from Focus with Spatio-Focal Dual Variational Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21992)
*Sungmin Woo,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFocus is a novel Depth-from-Focus framework that uses dual constraints to model focus changes across spatial and focal dimensions, improving depth estimation in complex scenes with fine textures and abrupt depth changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based DFF methods struggle in complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes where focus cues become ambiguous or misleading.

Method: Uses variational formulation with dual constraints: spatial constraints analyze gradient pattern changes across focus levels to distinguish depth edges from texture artifacts, and focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with physical focus behavior.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The dual constraint approach with spatial and focal inductive biases improves robustness and accuracy in challenging regions for depth-from-focus estimation.

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on rate-distortion theory that achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing communication volume by up to 108 times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks theoretical foundation for the trade-off between task performance and communication volume in collaborative perception systems with limited bandwidth resources.

Method: Proposes RDcomm framework with two innovations: task entropy discrete coding to assign task-relevant codeword-lengths, and mutual-information-driven message selection to eliminate redundancy using mutual information neural estimation.

Result: RDcomm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V datasets for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation while reducing communication volume by up to 108 times.

Conclusion: The proposed rate-distortion theory and RDcomm framework provide both theoretical foundation and practical solution for communication-efficient collaborative perception in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

TL;DR: FailureAtlas is a framework that autonomously explores and maps failure landscapes of Text-to-Image models through active exploration, discovering hundreds of thousands of previously unknown error slices and linking them to training data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks have limited diagnostic power for uncovering systematic failures in T2I models and isolating their root causes. There's a need for active exploration to better understand model weaknesses.

Method: Frames error discovery as structured search for minimal failure-inducing concepts, using novel acceleration techniques to make the computationally explosive problem tractable.

Result: Applied to Stable Diffusion models, discovered over 247,000 previously unknown error slices in SD1.5 alone, providing large-scale evidence linking failures to training data scarcity.

Conclusion: FailureAtlas establishes a diagnostic-first methodology for deep model auditing, guiding development of more robust generative AI through principled and scalable failure exploration.

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

### [203] [Exposing Hallucinations To Suppress Them: VLMs Representation Editing With Generative Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21997)
*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method that reduces hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by using text-to-image projection to amplify hallucination signals and editing decoder hidden states using dual visual anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from persistent hallucinations that produce fluent but visually inconsistent content, and existing mitigation approaches require additional training, handcrafted priors, or compromise informativeness and scalability.

Method: Uses hallucination amplification via text-to-image projection to create negative anchors, while original images serve as positive anchors. Edits decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics and pushing away from hallucination directions.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucinations at object, attribute, and relation levels while preserving recall and caption richness. Achieves over 5% hallucination reduction on CHAIR benchmark with LLaVA-v1.5-7B and shows strong cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: The method provides effective, efficient hallucination mitigation without training costs or human priors, with minimal side effects on hallucination-free captions, making it practically applicable as a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

*Xinyu Zhang,Yuxuan Dong,Lingling Zhang,Chengyou Jia,Zhuohang Dang,Basura Fernando,Jun Liu,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT is a training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by mimicking human visual cognition through iterative foresight-focus cycles, improving performance by 3.1-5.8% across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are constrained by complex and redundant visual input, making them susceptible to interference and hallucinations due to their inability to precisely discover and process required regions during reasoning.

Method: Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT) with three iterative stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation to explore reasoning paths, (2) Dual Foresight Decoding to evaluate samples based on visual focus and reasoning progression, and (3) Visual Focus Adjustment to refine attention toward beneficial regions.

Result: Empirical results show consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8% across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next models, with controllable computational overhead.

Conclusion: CoFFT effectively enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning, addressing limitations in processing complex visual input.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new egocentric video dataset for analyzing face-to-face instructional interactions and benchmarks multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against conventional models on procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face-to-face instructional interactions in the same physical space are critical for educational support and skill transfer, but have not been systematically studied in computer vision due to lack of suitable datasets and limited analytical techniques.

Method: The authors created a new egocentric video dataset with ground-truth annotations for procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. They benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that jointly process images, audio, and text against conventional task-specific models.

Result: MLLMs outperformed specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating their promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions that involve multiple modalities including speech content/prosody, gaze/body motion, and visual context.

Conclusion: The study shows that multimodal large language models are effective for understanding face-to-face instructional scenes and can handle verbal and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner, suggesting their potential for comprehensive analysis of instructional interactions.

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS is a generative audio-visual separation framework that uses diffusion models (DDPM and Flow Matching) to directly synthesize separated sound spectrograms from noise, conditioned on mixed audio and visual inputs, achieving superior separation quality across diverse sound categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based regression methods for audio-visual sound separation have limitations in capturing complex data distributions needed for high-quality separation of diverse sound categories, motivating the need for generative approaches.

Method: DAVIS uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching within a specialized Separation U-Net architecture to synthesize separated sound spectrograms directly from noise distribution, conditioned on mixed audio and visual information.

Result: Both DDPM and Flow Matching variants of DAVIS surpass existing methods in separation quality on standard AVE and MUSIC datasets, demonstrating superior performance for diverse sound categories.

Conclusion: The generative framework of DAVIS proves highly effective for audio-visual source separation, with both diffusion-based variants outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing realism of GANs and diffusion models makes deepfake detection challenging. Existing approaches focusing only on spatial or frequency-domain features have limited generalization to unseen manipulations.

Method: Proposed Spectral Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet) with Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC) that decomposes features into local spatial branch and global spectral branch using Fast Fourier Transform, plus Dual Fourier Attention (DFA) module for dynamic feature fusion. Built on modified XceptionNet backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple deepfake benchmarks, particularly effective in cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios while maintaining real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: Unified spatial-spectral learning is effective for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. Code released on GitHub for reproducibility.

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGM is a novel framework that generates 3D content with PBR materials (albedo, roughness, metallic) instead of just RGB textures, enabling dynamic relighting in various environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction models fail to produce material properties needed for realistic rendering in diverse lighting conditions, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Fine-tunes a multiview material diffusion model conditioned on depth and normal maps, then uses Gaussian material representation to model PBR material channels and reconstruct point clouds with PBR attributes.

Result: Produces materials with greater visual appeal than baseline methods and enhances material modeling for practical rendering applications.

Conclusion: MGM successfully generates high-quality 3D content with PBR materials that enable dynamic relighting, addressing a key limitation in current 3D reconstruction approaches.

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised point cloud completion method using multi-view augmentations and Mamba architecture to overcome limitations of existing supervised, unsupervised, and weakly-supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point cloud completion methods have limitations: supervised methods rely on ground truth and suffer from synthetic-to-real domain gap, unsupervised methods need complete point clouds, weakly-supervised methods require multi-view observations, and existing self-supervised methods produce unsatisfactory predictions due to limited self-supervised signals.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised approach using multi-view augmentations of single partial point clouds as novel self-supervised signals, and incorporates Mamba architecture to enhance learning capability for generating higher quality point clouds.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised method with multi-view augmentations and Mamba architecture effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates superior performance in point cloud completion tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High resource demands of conditional image generation models and scarcity of well-annotated data hinder deployment on edge devices, causing high costs and privacy concerns when user data is sent to third parties.

Method: Uses semi-supervised distillation with tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different levels of knowledge, and leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in computational cost and latency while maintaining high-fidelity generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative metrics.

Conclusion: Refine-Control effectively addresses the deployment challenges of conditional image generation models on edge devices through efficient knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Junwei Hu,Chunhua Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JGEKD is a classification strategy for non-IID 3D point clouds that uses joint graph entropy knowledge distillation to capture class correlations and improve robustness against corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D point cloud classification assumes IID data, which destroys class correlations. This paper addresses the need for methods that handle non-IID data while preserving inter-class relationships.

Method: Uses joint graphs to capture hidden class relationships, implements knowledge distillation via joint graph entropy loss, constructs Siamese structures for spatial transformation invariance, and develops self-knowledge and teacher-knowledge distillation frameworks.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanObject, ModelNet40, ScanntV2_cls and ModelNet-C datasets demonstrate competitive performance.

*Jonas Belouadi,Tamy Boubekeur,Adrien Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiMat is a multimodal program synthesis framework that uses large multimodal models to generate procedural material graphs by processing both visual and textual representations, outperforming text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material node graphs are challenging to create and require professional training. Existing neural program synthesis methods only use textual representations, failing to capture the visual-spatial nature that makes node graphs intuitive for humans.

Method: Leverages large multimodal models to process both visual and textual graph representations, trained on a dataset of production-quality procedural materials, combined with a constrained tree search inference algorithm for syntactic validity.

Result: More efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Multimodal program synthesis that combines visual and textual representations significantly improves procedural material graph generation compared to text-only approaches.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN, and PCA to enhance latent space efficiency and controllability for GAN-generated images, improving optimization efficiency while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and interpretability of latent space exploration in GANs by combining dimensionality reduction with intuitive image manipulation capabilities.

Method: Combines StyleGAN's structured latent space, DragGAN's intuitive manipulation, and PCA for dimensionality reduction and cross-model alignment, applied to AFHQ dataset.

Result: PCA integration reduces optimization time while maintaining visual quality, boosts SSIM in shallower latent spaces, and enables cross-domain image alignment and manipulation.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient and interpretable latent space control for diverse image synthesis and editing applications.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient document parsing model that can handle high-resolution inputs without computational overhead while maintaining fine-grained recognition accuracy for dense text, formulas, and tables.

Method: Two-stage parsing strategy: first stage performs layout analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, second stage performs targeted content recognition on native-resolution crops guided by the global layout. Supported by a comprehensive data engine for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability with exceptional computational efficiency through its coarse-to-fine, two-stage parsing approach and comprehensive training data generation.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-CoT framework enables verifiable multi-step reasoning in remote sensing VLMs using supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization, outperforming SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs in remote sensing fail at complex analytical tasks due to end-to-end training that bypasses reasoning steps and produces unverifiable outputs.

Method: Two-stage alignment strategy: supervised fine-tuning to instill cognitive architecture, then Group Reward Policy Optimization to refine reasoning policy. Uses Geo-CoT380k dataset of structured rationales.

Result: RSThinker model outputs both final answers and verifiable analytical traces, achieving dominant performance across comprehensive tasks.

Conclusion: Provides concrete pathway from opaque perception to structured, verifiable reasoning in Earth Observation through public release of dataset and model.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat is a training-free framework that lifts 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes without per-scene retraining, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from costly per-scene retraining, monosemous design that fails to represent multi-concept semantics, and vulnerability to cross-view semantic inconsistencies.

Method: Leverages pre-trained 2D segmentation to generate multi-granularity 2D masks, lifts them to 3D, estimates foreground probabilities, optimizes boundaries using semantic entropy and geometric opacity, and uses VLM to distill robust textual features for open-vocabulary querying.

Result: Reduces scene adaptation time from hours to minutes, outperforms training-based frameworks on open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MUSplat successfully eliminates costly per-scene training while addressing monosemous limitations and achieving superior performance in open-vocabulary 3D understanding.

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel is a comprehensive benchmark with 14.3K visual questions to evaluate MLLMs' urban development understanding across static perception, temporal change, and subjective environmental perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks lack systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception in urban environments, which is essential for sustainable development given urban development impacts over half the global population.

Method: Collected multi-temporal street-view images from 11 cities worldwide and generated question-answer pairs using spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation across three dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception.

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro achieved best overall performance, approaching human expert levels with only 1.5% gap. Models perform well on scene understanding tasks (some even surpass humans in pixel-level change detection) but struggle with temporal reasoning. Several models reach human-level consistency in subjective perception dimensions like beauty and safety.

Conclusion: MLLMs show strong capabilities in urban scene understanding and subjective perception but need improvement in temporal reasoning for urban development tasks. UrbanFeel provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' urban environment understanding.

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

TL;DR: EXCL is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation method that uses dual experts (source model and vision-language model) with retrieval-augmented interaction to adapt models to target domains without accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and cost concerns in domain adaptation by eliminating the need for source data access, while overcoming limitations of existing SFUDA methods that neglect complementary insights and target data structure.

Method: Dual Experts framework with frozen source-domain model (plus Conv-Adapter) and pretrained vision-language model (with trainable text prompt), trained via Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction pipeline that retrieves pseudo-source/complex samples, fine-tunes experts separately, and enforces learning consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art matching performance in source-free unsupervised domain adaptation.

Conclusion: EXCL effectively adapts models to target domains without source data by leveraging dual experts and retrieval-augmented interaction, achieving competitive performance while addressing privacy and cost constraints.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable

To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map construction methods are costly and inefficient, while existing satellite-based methods suffer from data limitations (occlusions, outdatedness) and inefficient vectorization that produces discontinuous roads requiring extensive post-processing.

Method: Represents lane lines as discrete sequences with iterative generation strategy; supports multi-modal inputs (BEV, PV, text prompt); employs state update strategy for global continuity and consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenSatMap dataset; can infer occluded roads and predict missing roads from dataset annotations.

Conclusion: UniMapGen provides an efficient generative framework for large-scale map construction that overcomes limitations of traditional and satellite-based methods through discrete sequence representation and multi-modal input flexibility.

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M: A unified framework for joint mesh reconstruction and material decomposition from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting, eliminating neural components while handling reflective surfaces effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods handle mesh reconstruction and material decomposition separately, struggle with reflective surfaces, and rely on external priors. Current joint approaches use complex neural networks that limit scalability.

Method: Joint optimization of depth and normal attributes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, with a novel roughness supervision strategy based on multi-view photometric variation and carefully designed loss functions.

Result: Produces comparable reconstruction results to state-of-the-art methods, delivering triangle meshes and material components for downstream tasks, validated on widely used datasets.

Conclusion: The unified GS-2M framework effectively solves mesh reconstruction and material decomposition jointly without neural components, maintaining geometric details and handling reflective surfaces robustly.

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MesaTask is an LLM-based framework that generates realistic tabletop scenes for robot manipulation tasks by decomposing scene generation into object inference, spatial reasoning, and scene graph construction, using a novel Spatial Reasoning Chain approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for creating tabletop scenes for robot training rely on manual layout design or randomized layouts, which are limited in plausibility and task alignment. There's a substantial gap between high-level task instructions and realistic tabletop scenes.

Method: Proposed a Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes scene generation into three steps: object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for final 3D layout. Uses LLM-based framework enhanced with DPO algorithms.

Result: Created MesaTask-10K dataset with 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with realistic layouts. MesaTask framework demonstrated superior performance compared to baselines in generating task-conforming scenes with realistic layouts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the gap between task instructions and tabletop scene generation, producing physically plausible scenes that align well with given task descriptions for robot manipulation training.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

*Michael Jungo,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rule-based reinforcement learning improves generalization in document image classification, especially for out-of-distribution data across different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the benefits of rule-based reinforcement learning in document analysis, particularly for enhancing reasoning capabilities and generalization to out-of-distribution data.

Method: Applied rule-based reinforcement learning to document image classification task, testing generalization across three scenarios: out-of-distribution images, unseen classes, and different modalities.

Result: Reinforcement learning demonstrated better generalization capabilities compared to traditional methods, performing well on out-of-distribution data in all three tested scenarios.

Conclusion: Rule-based reinforcement learning is effective for document analysis tasks, offering improved generalization to diverse data distributions and modalities.

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

### [226] [Jailbreaking on Text-to-Video Models via Scene Splitting Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22292)
*Wonjun Lee,Haon Park,Doehyeon Lee,Bumsub Ham,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit is a black-box jailbreak method that fragments harmful narratives into multiple benign scenes to bypass Text-to-Video (T2V) model safety filters, achieving high attack success rates on multiple T2V platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Video models have significant safety risks that remain largely unexplored compared to other AI models like LLMs and T2I models, creating a critical safety gap that needs addressing.

Method: SceneSplit fragments harmful narratives into multiple individually benign scenes, manipulates the generative output space through sequential scene combination, uses iterative scene manipulation to bypass safety filters, and employs a strategy library to reuse successful attack patterns.

Result: Achieved high average Attack Success Rates: 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly outperforming existing baselines across 11 safety categories.

Conclusion: Current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks exploiting narrative structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving T2V model safety.

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a momentum-based sampling technique that improves diffusion model outputs by integrating recent predictions into each step, enhancing image quality and efficiency without extra computation or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models still produce unrealistic outputs with poor details when using fewer neural function evaluations or lower guidance scales, requiring a solution that improves quality without additional computational cost.

Method: History-guided sampling (HiGS) leverages the difference between current predictions and a weighted average of past predictions to guide sampling toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure.

Result: HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and achieves state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256×256 with only 30 sampling steps instead of standard 250.

Conclusion: HiGS serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that enables faster diffusion sampling with higher fidelity, requiring no extra training or fine-tuning while seamlessly integrating into existing frameworks.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VeloxSeg is a lightweight 3D medical image segmentation framework that addresses the efficiency/robustness conflict through a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution, achieving significant performance improvements and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict" in lightweight 3D medical image segmentation, particularly when dealing with complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities, by redesigning the framework based on high-dimensional 3D image characteristics.

Method: Uses a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention (PWA) for multi-scale information retrieval and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution (JLC) for robust local feature extraction. Incorporates modal interaction and Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer (SDKT) via Gram matrices to inject texture priors from self-supervised networks.

Result: Achieves 26% Dice improvement on multimodal benchmarks while increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU throughput by 48x compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VeloxSeg successfully addresses the efficiency-robustness trade-off in lightweight 3D medical image segmentation, providing strong performance improvements and computational efficiency without extra inference cost.

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3 is a training-free acceleration framework for Diffusion Transformers that uses three lightweight policy heads to achieve 3x faster sampling while maintaining quality, without updating the base generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT accelerators use uniform heuristics for all images, sacrificing quality, while dynamic networks require expensive fine-tuning. RAPID3 aims to provide per-image adaptive acceleration without generator updates.

Method: Uses three policy heads (Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, Sparse-Attention) that observe denoising state and make independent speed-up decisions. Trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization with frozen generator, augmented by adversarial discriminator to prevent reward hacking.

Result: Achieves nearly 3x faster sampling across state-of-the-art DiT backbones like Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX while maintaining competitive generation quality.

Conclusion: RAPID3 successfully enables image-wise adaptive acceleration for Diffusion Transformers without requiring updates to the base generator, achieving significant speed improvements while preserving quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal knowledge graph approach for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) that mines relationships between visual features, attribute text, and contextual information to improve recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAR methods fail to fully exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information. Existing approaches that use attribute text as additional input are still in early stages and don't effectively model the complex relationships between visual features and semantic attributes.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that considers relationships among attributes and between attributes and vision tokens. Introduces a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance standard PAR framework.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge graph approach for PAR tasks.

Conclusion: The method establishes a strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition and the source code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at natural image tasks but their ability to extract mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored, particularly in the engineering design workflow from system specifications to component implementations.

Method: Created CircuitSense benchmark with 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams, using hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline with grid-based schematic generator and block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.

Result: Closed-source models achieve >85% accuracy on perception tasks but <19% on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities achieve higher design task accuracy, establishing symbolic reasoning as key metric for engineering competence.

Conclusion: There is a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning in MLLMs for circuit understanding, with mathematical understanding being fundamental for engineering design competence.

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system

mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical

and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using GPT-4 to predict occlusion order relationships between objects in images through zero-shot reasoning, achieving accurate predictions without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion is a major challenge for vision models in interpreting complex real-world scenes, requiring robust methods to determine occlusion order between objects.

Method: Leverage pre-trained GPT-4 with specialized prompts to analyze images and generate occlusion order predictions, then parse responses to construct occlusion matrices for downstream tasks.

Result: Evaluation on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets shows the model produces more accurate order predictions using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach enables zero-shot occlusion reasoning without annotated training data and can be easily integrated into existing occlusion handling frameworks.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-focus image fusion method using gradient-domain modeling and boundary enhancement to produce all-focused images with sharp boundaries and preserved details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-focus image fusion methods struggle with preserving sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in blurred transitions and loss of focused details.

Method: Proposes a gradient-domain-based model for initial fusion with complete boundaries, Tenengrad gradient detection for salient feature extraction, and a focus metric integrating gradient and complementary information for boundary refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates high-quality fused boundaries while preserving focus information, achieving superior performance in multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

*Wenqiang Wang,Siyuan Liang,Xiao Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDOA is a text adversarial attack method that handles dynamic output scenarios using clustering-based surrogate training and farthest-label targeting, achieving up to 50.81% success rate with single queries and also excelling in static scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text adversarial attack methods are designed for static scenarios with fixed output labels and predefined label spaces, creating a gap for dynamic-output scenarios.

Method: Uses clustering-based surrogate model training to convert dynamic-output scenarios into static single-output scenarios, and employs farthest-label targeted attack strategy to select adversarial vectors that deviate most from model's coarse-grained labels.

Result: Achieves maximum attack success rate of 50.81% with single query per text on dynamic scenarios, and 82.68% on static scenarios. Also extends to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64 RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Conclusion: TDOA effectively addresses dynamic output scenarios in text adversarial attacks, demonstrates strong performance in compromising large language models with limited access, and shows state-of-the-art results in both static and generative settings.

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

### [238] [Integrating Background Knowledge in Medical Semantic Segmentation with Logic Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22399)
*Luca Bergamin,Giovanna Maria Dimitri,Fabio Aiolli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to incorporate medical knowledge into semantic segmentation models, showing improved performance especially with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning segmentation systems are imperfect and could benefit from incorporating medical background knowledge to improve performance.

Method: Use Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to encode medical knowledge using first-order logic rules, combined with SwinUNETR in an end-to-end framework for hippocampus segmentation in brain MRI.

Result: LTNs improved baseline segmentation performance, particularly when training data was scarce.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic methods like LTNs are generalizable and can be adapted to other medical semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

### [239] [Closing the Safety Gap: Surgical Concept Erasure in Visual Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22400)
*Xinhao Zhong,Yimin Zhou,Zhiqi Zhang,Junhao Li,Yi Sun,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VARE and S-VARE frameworks for stable concept erasure in visual autoregressive (VAR) models, addressing safety concerns in text-to-image generation by minimizing unsafe token adjustments while preserving semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure techniques designed for diffusion models fail to work with VAR models due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm, creating safety gaps in autoregressive text-to-image generation.

Method: Proposes VARE framework using auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity, and S-VARE method incorporating filtered cross entropy loss to identify unsafe visual tokens and preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, effectively closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed VARE and S-VARE frameworks successfully enable stable concept erasure in VAR models, addressing safety concerns without compromising generation quality or introducing language drift and diversity issues.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

### [240] [RAU: Reference-based Anatomical Understanding with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22404)
*Yiwei Li,Yikang Liu,Jiaqi Guo,Lin Zhao,Zheyuan Zhang,Xiao Chen,Boris Mailhe,Ankush Mukherjee,Terrence Chen,Shanhui Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAU is a framework that uses vision-language models for reference-based anatomical understanding in medical imaging, enabling identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical structures by leveraging spatial reasoning between reference and target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical understanding in medical imaging is crucial for automated workflows but limited by scarce expert-labeled data. Reference-based guidance offers a solution, but current VLMs lack fine-grained localization capabilities for medical applications.

Method: RAU combines VLM spatial reasoning trained on moderate datasets with SAM2's segmentation capability. It uses VQA and bounding box prediction for anatomical region identification, then integrates spatial cues with SAM2 for pixel-level segmentation of small structures like vessel segments.

Result: RAU outperforms SAM2 fine-tuning baselines across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, achieving more accurate segmentations and reliable localization. It demonstrates strong generalization to OOD datasets, which is crucial for medical applications.

Conclusion: RAU is the first framework to explore VLMs for reference-based anatomical identification, localization, and segmentation in medical images, showing promising performance for automated clinical workflows and highlighting VLM-driven approaches' potential in medical imaging.

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

*Hossein Kashiani,Niloufar Alipour Talemi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDebias addresses spectral bias in deepfake detectors by using frequency debiasing through Fo-Mixup augmentation and dual consistency regularization to improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors fail to generalize to novel forgery types due to spectral bias - over-reliance on specific frequency bands learned from limited training data.

Method: Proposes FreqDebias framework with: 1) Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup) augmentation to diversify frequency characteristics, and 2) Dual consistency regularization using class activation maps (local) and von Mises-Fisher distribution on hyperspherical embeddings (global).

Result: Extensive experiments show FreqDebias significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency debiasing framework effectively mitigates spectral bias and improves deepfake detection generalization across different forgery types.

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

### [242] [LucidFlux: Caption-Free Universal Image Restoration via a Large-Scale Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22414)
*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux is a caption-free universal image restoration framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions, using a dual-branch conditioner and adaptive modulation to achieve robust restoration while preserving semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift when recovering images degraded by unknown mixtures while preserving semantics, especially in caption-free scenarios.

Method: Uses a lightweight dual-branch conditioner to inject signals from degraded input and lightly restored proxy; implements timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule; enforces caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features; employs scalable curation pipeline for structure-rich supervision.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks; ablation studies verify necessity of each component.

Conclusion: For large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on—rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts—is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

### [243] [Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415)
*Jiawei Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Xianghao Jiao,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Zheng Hu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve interpretability of Multimodal Large Language Models by addressing intra-modal dependencies in both visual and textual modalities through Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation (MSEA) and Activation Ranking Correlation (ARC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability research for MLLMs focuses mainly on cross-modal attribution but overlooks intra-modal dependencies, leading to fragmented visual explanations and spurious textual activations that compromise attribution fidelity.

Method: For visual modality: Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation (MSEA) aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields. For textual modality: Activation Ranking Correlation (ARC) measures relevance of contextual tokens via alignment of their top-k prediction rankings to suppress spurious activations.

Result: Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance interpretability of MLLMs by addressing intra-modal dependencies, producing more holistic visual explanations and suppressing spurious textual activations while preserving semantically coherent information.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

*Bohan Huang,Qianyun Bao,Haoyuan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-MAN enhances U-Net for medical image segmentation by replacing simple skip connections with Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and adding Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN) modules to handle multi-scale features, achieving superior boundary accuracy and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional U-Net architectures struggle with preserving fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to semantic gaps in skip connections and lack of multi-scale feature extraction in deep layers.

Method: Proposed U-MAN architecture with two key modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) to replace simple skip connections using attention mechanisms, and Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN) for adaptive multi-scale feature processing.

Result: Experiments on BUSI, GLAS, and CVC datasets show U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Conclusion: U-MAN effectively addresses U-Net limitations through attention-based feature fusion and multi-scale processing, demonstrating superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

### [245] [$γ$-Quant: Towards Learnable Quantization for Low-bit Pattern Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22448)
*Mishal Fatima,Shashank Agnihotri,Marius Bock,Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota,Kristof Van Laerhoven,Michael Moeller,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes γ-Quant, a method for learning task-specific non-linear quantization of raw sensor data to enable efficient pattern recognition with low-bit-depth data (as few as 4 bits) while maintaining performance comparable to using higher-bit raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pattern recognition models use pre-processed data optimized for human perception (e.g., ISP-processed images) or high-bit ADC data, which is inefficient for automated analysis and energy-constrained devices. There's a need for more efficient data representation for tasks where human perception is not required.

Method: The authors propose γ-Quant, which learns a task-specific non-linear quantization for pattern recognition. The method is demonstrated on raw-image object detection and human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable sensor data, using learnable quantization with low bit depths.

Result: The approach shows that raw data with learnable quantization using only 4 bits can achieve performance comparable to using raw 12-bit data, demonstrating significant efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Task-specific learnable quantization enables efficient pattern recognition in low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings, allowing sensors to operate with low-bit-depth capture without sacrificing performance for automated analysis tasks.

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

*Zixian Zhao,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework for segmentation-oriented visible and infrared image fusion that eliminates the need for segmentation labels by leveraging cross-segmentation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VIF methods only focus on image quality, while application-oriented methods require expensive labeled datasets for downstream tasks like segmentation. This creates a data acquisition bottleneck.

Method: Proposes SSVIF framework using cross-segmentation consistency between feature-level and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation. Includes two-stage training strategy and dynamic weight adjustment for joint learning without segmentation labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented methods, despite using only unlabeled visible-infrared image pairs.

Conclusion: The self-supervised approach successfully bridges the gap between traditional and application-oriented VIF methods by enabling segmentation-oriented fusion without requiring labeled segmentation data.

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework combining Bézier-curve-based style transfer and conditional diffusion models for cross-domain medical image generation and segmentation improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging modalities is challenging due to large domain gaps, and existing GAN-based style transfer methods struggle with regions of high variability.

Method: First uses Bézier-curve-based style transfer to reduce domain gap, then trains a segmentation model on transferred images to generate pseudo-labels, and finally trains a conditional diffusion model with uncertainty-guided score matching to synthesize high-quality labeled target-domain images.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augments the target domain, and improves segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Bézier Meets Diffusion framework effectively addresses cross-domain medical image generation challenges and enhances segmentation performance across domains.

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [248] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSTTS is a plug-and-play module that reduces computational overhead in event-based vision by identifying and removing spatio-temporal redundant tokens from event frame sequences, achieving significant efficiency improvements without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based methods convert event streams to event frames but neglect high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy, leading to computational inefficiency. Token sparsification methods for RGB videos are ineffective for event data due to unreliable intermediate representations and event noise.

Method: PSTTS consists of two stages: Spatial Token Purification (discards noise and non-event regions using spatio-temporal consistency) and Temporal Token Selection (removes redundant temporal information by evaluating motion pattern similarity between adjacent frames). It uses raw event data distribution without additional parameters.

Result: Applied to four backbones on three datasets, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on DailyDVS-200 dataset while maintaining task accuracy.

Conclusion: PSTTS effectively addresses computational inefficiency in event-based vision by exploiting inherent spatio-temporal characteristics of event data, achieving optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off as a parameter-free plug-and-play module.

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

### [249] [Group Critical-token Policy Optimization for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22485)
*Guohui Zhang,Hu Yu,Xiaoxiao Ma,JingHao Zhang,Yaning Pan,Mingde Yao,Jie Xiao,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCPO is a method that identifies critical tokens in autoregressive visual generation for more effective policy optimization, achieving better performance using only 30% of tokens compared to full-token approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, but different tokens contribute variably to training effectiveness. The key challenge is identifying and optimizing critical tokens during AR generation.

Method: GCPO identifies critical tokens from three perspectives: causal dependency (early tokens determine later ones), entropy-induced spatial structure (high entropy gradient tokens), and RLVR-focused token diversity (low similarity tokens). It uses dynamic token-wise advantage weights based on confidence divergence between policy and reference models.

Result: GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens while using only 30% of image tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness for both AR models and unified multimodal models.

Conclusion: GCPO provides an effective approach for token-wise optimization in RLVR-based AR visual generation by focusing on critical tokens, improving efficiency and performance compared to uniform optimization methods.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAGLE is a lightweight black-box framework that explains token generation in multimodal LLMs by attributing tokens to visual regions and quantifying language vs. perceptual influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack understanding of how generated tokens depend on visual inputs, limiting interpretability and reliability.

Method: Uses greedy search over sparsified image regions with unified objective function combining sufficiency and indispensability scores for attribution.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis while using less GPU memory.

Conclusion: EAGLE provides effective and practical interpretability for MLLMs through fine-grained attribution and modality-aware analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across

*Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Muhammad Atif Butt,Valero Laparra,Jesus Malo,Javier Vazquez-Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation shows VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors but struggle with non-prototypical colors, with language model architecture significantly influencing color naming independent of visual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether vision-language models name colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction, as color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception.

Method: Replicated classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across five representative VLMs, conducted cross-linguistic analysis across nine languages, and performed ablation studies.

Result: VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors but performance drops significantly on expanded non-prototypical sets. Identified 21 common color terms across all models, with constrained models using basic terms versus expansive models using systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis shows severe training imbalances favoring English and Chinese.

Conclusion: Language model architecture significantly influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities, and current VLMs exhibit limitations in color naming compared to human performance, particularly for non-prototypical colors and non-English languages.

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

TL;DR: EfficientDepth is a novel monocular depth estimation system that combines transformer architecture with lightweight convolutional decoder and bimodal density head to achieve geometric consistency, fine details, and efficiency for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MDE methods fail to meet requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges, and efficiency for edge devices.

Method: Combines transformer architecture with lightweight convolutional decoder and bimodal density head; trained on labeled synthetic/real images and pseudo-labeled real images; uses multi-stage optimization strategy and LPIPS-based loss function.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational resources.

Conclusion: EfficientDepth successfully addresses key challenges in MDE while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications on edge devices.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Category discovery has emerged as an important open-world learning task with significant attention and a rich body of literature, requiring systematic organization and analysis of different approaches.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy with base settings (NCD and GCD) and derived settings for real-world scenarios, analyzes methods across three components (representation learning, label assignment, class number estimation), and benchmarks all methods.

Conclusion: The survey distills key insights from current literature and identifies promising future research directions, providing a living survey resource for the category discovery community.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

*Mohammad Mahdi Hemmatyar,Mahdi Jafari,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Mohammad Reza Nemati,Mobin Azadani,Hamid Reza Rastad,Amirmohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyCoVAD is a hybrid SSL-LLM model for video anomaly detection that combines self-supervised learning for temporal analysis with LLM-based semantic validation to detect complex anomalies involving multiple entities and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods struggle with semantic understanding of complex interactions, while LLMs are computationally expensive and lack spatial localization. There's a need to combine both approaches for effective complex anomaly detection.

Method: Uses a hybrid approach with multi-task SSL temporal analyzer (nnFormer backbone) to identify suspicious frames, followed by LLM validator that applies structured, rule-based reasoning for semantic context validation.

Result: Achieves 72.5% frame-level AUC on ComplexVAD dataset, outperforming baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation.

Conclusion: HyCoVAD effectively combines SSL and LLM strengths for complex video anomaly detection, providing better performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

### [255] [JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548)
*Shuang Zeng,Dekang Qi,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Shiyi Liang,Mu Xu,Xing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN proposes a dual implicit neural memory framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as compact neural representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance by enhancing spatial reasoning and enabling efficient incremental updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods relying on explicit semantic memory suffer from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat. Inspired by human navigation with implicit scene representation, the authors aim to create a more efficient navigation framework.

Method: Extends MLLM with 3D prior knowledge from spatial-geometric encoder, constructs dual implicit memory from historical key-value caches of spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders, and uses sliding window approach to avoid redundant computation.

Result: Outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance, with success rate improvements of 10.5-35.5% compared to methods using multiple data types and 3.6-10.8% compared to methods using more RGB training data.

Conclusion: The dual implicit neural memory represents a novel paradigm that explores promising new directions for future VLN research by addressing efficiency and performance limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch is the first semi-supervised learning framework for spiking neural networks that uses temporal dynamics and co-training with pseudo-labeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised learning methods for spiking neural networks are underexplored compared to artificial neural networks, despite SNNs' biological plausibility and energy efficiency advantages.

Method: Uses temporal dynamics through SNN leakage factor for diverse pseudo-labeling in co-training framework. Generates reliable pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented samples to train on strongly-augmented ones, leveraging agreement among multiple predictions from a single SNN.

Result: Outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: SpikeMatch effectively mitigates confirmation bias and captures discriminative features with limited labels, demonstrating the viability of SSL for SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

### [257] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is proposed as an alternative visual representation to RGB images for vision-language pipelines, offering better compression and computational efficiency while maintaining semantic alignment capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-based vision pipelines suffer from two inefficiencies: (1) high transmission costs for dense RGB images from edge devices to cloud, and (2) patch-based tokenization that increases sequence length and stresses attention mechanisms.

Method: Developed scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance-aware pruning, and optimized CUDA kernels. Adapted CLIP training to 2DGS using frozen RGB transformer backbone with splat-aware input stem and perceiver resampler, training only 7% of parameters.

Result: Achieved 90x faster fitting and 97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. GS encoders provide 3-20x input compression while yielding meaningful zero-shot ImageNet-1K performance, though accuracy still trails RGB encoders.

Conclusion: 2DGS is established as a viable multimodal substrate that enables transmission-efficient representations for edge-cloud learning, with identified architectural bottlenecks pointing toward future improvements.

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

### [258] [LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22622)
*Shuai Yang,Wei Huang,Ruihang Chu,Yicheng Xiao,Yuyang Zhao,Xianbang Wang,Muyang Li,Enze Xie,Yingcong Chen,Yao Lu,Song Han,Yukang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive is a frame-level autoregressive framework for real-time long video generation that addresses efficiency and quality challenges through KV-recache mechanism, streaming long tuning, and short window attention with frame sink.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods: diffusion models are inefficient due to bidirectional attention, while causal AR models degrade in quality on long videos. Also, interactive capabilities for dynamic content creation need to ensure visual consistency during prompt transitions.

Method: Uses causal frame-level AR design with KV-recache mechanism for smooth prompt switching, streaming long tuning for long video training, and short window attention with frame sink to preserve long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.

Result: Fine-tunes 1.3B-parameter model to minute-long generation in 32 GPU-days, achieves 20.7 FPS on single H100, strong VBench performance on short/long videos, supports up to 240-second videos, and INT8-quantized inference with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: LongLive successfully addresses efficiency and quality challenges in long video generation while supporting real-time interactive capabilities through its innovative AR framework design.

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

*Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Shengyuan Ding,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK is a synergistic framework that recycles rollouts and correctness data to train the model itself as a generative reward model, eliminating need for separate reward models and human preference data while creating a co-evolving feedback loop between policy and reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of RLHF (high costs, reward-policy mismatch) and RLVR (wasted supervision from discarded rollouts and correctness signals after updates).

Method: Recycles rollouts and correctness data to simultaneously train the model as a generative reward model using mixed objectives (pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses). Creates co-evolving feedback loop between policy and reward.

Result: Significant performance gains on multiple benchmarks: SPARK-VL-7B achieved 9.7% average gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over baselines.

Conclusion: SPARK provides an efficient, on-policy, stable framework that eliminates need for separate reward models and costly human preference data while achieving robust performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCNeXt is a self-supervised CNN architecture for depth estimation that outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs while being computationally efficient, achieving 10.18x speedup over current best models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation is crucial for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and AR applications that operate under computational constraints. Self-supervised approaches are needed due to difficulty acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data across diverse scenarios.

Method: Proposes CCNeXt architecture with modern CNN feature extractor, novel windowed epipolar cross-attention module in encoder, and comprehensive redesign of depth estimation decoder. Uses stereo image pairs for self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves competitive metrics on KITTI Eigen Split test data with 10.18x speedup over current best model. Achieves state-of-the-art results in all metrics on KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets.

Conclusion: CCNeXt provides an efficient and effective self-supervised solution for depth estimation that balances computational cost with performance, outperforming both CNN and ViT approaches.

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT is a structured reasoning framework that uses Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create symbolic chain-of-thought reasoning and executable action plans, outperforming traditional unstructured CoT in embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Chain-of-Thought prompting relies on unstructured text, which limits interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Existing structured CoTs using scene or logic graphs are limited to low-order relations and lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral abstraction.

Method: UML-CoT uses UML class diagrams to capture compositional object semantics and activity diagrams to model procedural control flow. The training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data.

Result: Evaluated on MRoom-30k benchmark for cluttered room-cleaning scenarios, UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success.

Conclusion: UML provides a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism compared to existing approaches, enabling better reasoning and planning in embodied tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot is an AI agent for automated computer vision data curation that combines calibrated discovery, controllable synthesis, and consensus annotation to efficiently create high-quality datasets from large unlabeled data lakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curating high-quality domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data quality, diversity, and cost when dealing with vast unlabeled data lakes.

Method: A central orchestrator agent powered by a large multimodal language model uses multi-step reasoning to execute three specialized tools: Calibrated Discovery for sourcing relevant data, Controllable Synthesis for generating novel data for rare scenarios, and Consensus Annotation for producing accurate labels via multiple foundation models with novel consensus mechanisms.

Result: On COCO dataset, achieved 14.2 candidate proposals per image (double the ground-truth), with 37.1% mAP. On Open Images, discovered 903 new bounding box categories (total 1500+). Calibrated Discovery was 40x more computationally efficient at 10-million sample scale with equivalent sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Agentic workflow with optimized, scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale datasets, proving effective for automated data curation in computer vision.

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIPSY is a training-free approach for few-shot image classification that uses IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate synthetic images from limited examples, achieving state-of-the-art performance without model fine-tuning or external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot image classification is challenging due to limited labeled data. Existing methods using text-to-image diffusion models often require extensive fine-tuning or external information sources, which DIPSY aims to eliminate.

Method: DIPSY leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation with three innovations: extended classifier-free guidance for independent positive/negative conditioning, class similarity-based sampling for contrastive examples, and a simple pipeline requiring no fine-tuning or external tools.

Result: Experiments across ten benchmark datasets show DIPSY achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, demonstrating effectiveness particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Conclusion: DIPSY successfully eliminates the need for generative model adaptation and external tools while maintaining high performance, highlighting the effectiveness of dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

### [264] [Scale-Wise VAR is Secretly Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22636)
*Amandeep Kumar,Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that VAR with Markovian attention mask is mathematically equivalent to discrete diffusion, enabling integration of diffusion advantages into autoregressive transformers for improved visual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge autoregressive transformers and diffusion models by establishing their mathematical equivalence, allowing AR models to benefit from diffusion techniques like iterative refinement.

Method: Reinterpret VAR with Markovian attention mask as Scalable Visual Refinement with Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), importing diffusion advantages into the AR framework.

Result: The diffusion-based perspective of VAR leads to faster convergence, lower inference cost, improved zero-shot reconstruction, and consistent gains in efficiency and generation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Establishing the equivalence between VAR and discrete diffusion provides a principled bridge that enables AR transformers to leverage diffusion advantages for enhanced visual generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

### [265] [Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645)
*Zhen-Hao Wen,Yan Wang,Ji Feng,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN introduces hierarchical representation matching for CLIP-based class-incremental learning, using LLMs to generate discriminative textual descriptors that capture both coarse and fine-grained visual concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based CIL approaches use simplistic templates like "a photo of a [CLASS]" that overlook hierarchical visual concepts and only use the last layer representation, missing hierarchical information from earlier layers.

Method: Leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, matches them to different semantic hierarchy levels, and adaptively routes them based on task requirements to enable precise discrimination while reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that HERMAN consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in class-incremental learning.

Conclusion: The hierarchical representation matching approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing CLIP-based CIL methods by incorporating explicit hierarchical cues and leveraging multi-layer representations.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward is a benchmark for detecting AI-generated videos through human-identified spatiotemporal artifacts, with 4.3K annotations across 3.3K videos, and trains multimodal language models that outperform GPT-5 by 34.7% on fake clue identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked dimension of whether humans can detect deepfake traces in generated videos, focusing on spatiotemporal visual artifacts that reveal videos as machine-generated.

Method: Created DeeptraceReward benchmark with detailed annotations including natural-language explanations, bounding-box regions, and precise timestamps. Trained multimodal language models as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations.

Result: The 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Found consistent difficulty gradient: binary classification easiest, then explanations, spatial grounding, and temporal labeling hardest.

Conclusion: DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation by foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

### [267] [CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647)
*Long Xing,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jianze Liang,Qidong Huang,Jiaqi Wang,Feng Wu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRL applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to image captioning, using a vision-free LLM's question-answering accuracy as reward to overcome limitations of supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT-based captioning models rely on expensive human/proprietary annotations, leading to memorization and limited diversity. The subjective nature of caption quality makes objective reward design challenging.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: LVLM generates caption, then separate vision-free LLM answers multiple-choice questions based on caption. Reward is derived from LLM's accuracy, defining caption quality by its utility for non-visual understanding.

Result: Significant gains across 12 benchmarks when pretraining on CapRL-5M dataset. Achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B with 8.4% average improvement over baseline in Prism Framework evaluation.

Conclusion: CapRL successfully applies RLVR to subjective image captioning, demonstrating that utility-based reward (enabling accurate non-visual question answering) effectively improves caption quality and generality.

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

### [268] [RefAM: Attention Magnets for Zero-Shot Referral Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22650)
*Anna Kukleva,Enis Simsar,Alessio Tonioni,Muhammad Ferjad Naeem,Federico Tombari,Jan Eric Lenssen,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method that uses diffusion transformer features for referring segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning or architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring segmentation methods require fine-tuning or multiple pre-trained models with additional training and architectural changes, while diffusion models contain rich semantic information that can be exploited directly.

Method: Extracts features and attention scores from diffusion transformers, filters stop words that act as attention magnets, handles global attention sinks in deeper layers, and implements attention redistribution using appended stop words to partition background activations.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning or additional components.

Conclusion: Diffusion transformer features can be effectively leveraged for referring segmentation tasks through proper attention handling and redistribution, achieving superior performance in a training-free manner.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AgentPack is a 1.3M corpus of code edits co-authored by AI agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor Agent) from public GitHub projects, showing that models fine-tuned on this data outperform those trained on traditional human-only commit corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional commit-based training data for code editing models is noisy due to terse messages, commingled edits, and bot-generated commits. AI agent co-authored commits provide cleaner, more focused edits with detailed rationale.

Method: Collected 1.3M code edits from public GitHub projects co-authored by Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Cursor Agent up to mid-August 2025, with identification and curation pipeline to filter high-quality commits implicitly validated by human maintainers.

Result: Models fine-tuned on AgentPack corpus outperform models trained on prior human-only commit corpora, demonstrating the superior quality of AI agent co-authored code edits for training purposes.

Conclusion: Public data from software engineering agents represents a valuable resource for training future code-editing models, offering cleaner, more focused edits with detailed intent descriptions compared to traditional human-only commit data.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models for code editing has typically relied on
mining commits and pull requests. The working hypothesis has been that commit
messages describe human intent in natural language, and patches to code
describe the changes that implement that intent. However, much of the
previously collected data is noisy: commit messages are terse, human-written
commits commingle several unrelated edits, and many commits come from simple,
rule-based bots.
  The recent adoption of software engineering agents changes this landscape.
Code changes co-authored by humans and agents tend to be more narrowly scoped
and focused on clearer goals. Their commit messages, generated by LLMs,
articulate intent and rationale in much greater detail. Moreover, when these
changes land in public repositories, they are implicitly filtered by humans:
maintainers discard low-quality commits to their projects.
  We present AgentPack, a corpus of 1.3M code edits co-authored by Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex, and Cursor Agent across public GitHub projects up to mid-August
2025. We describe the identification and curation pipeline, quantify adoption
trends of these agents, and analyze the structural properties of the edits.
Finally, we show that models fine-tuned on AgentPack can outperform models
trained on prior human-only commit corpora, highlighting the potential of using
public data from software engineering agents to train future code-editing
models.

*Junkai Chen,Huihui Huang,Yunbo Lyu,Junwen An,Jieke Shi,Chengran Yang,Ting Zhang,Haoye Tian,Yikun Li,Zhenhao Li,Xin Zhou,Xing Hu,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureAgentBench is a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to evaluate code agents' secure code generation capabilities, revealing that current agents struggle to produce secure code even when functionally correct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook genuine vulnerability contexts and use narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities in LLM-powered code agents.

Method: SecureAgentBench includes realistic multi-file editing tasks in large repositories, aligned contexts based on real-world vulnerabilities with precise introduction points, and comprehensive evaluation combining functionality testing, vulnerability checking via exploits, and static analysis for new vulnerabilities.

Result: Current agents perform poorly on secure code generation - the best performer (SWE-agent with DeepSeek-V3.1) achieved only 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions. Some agents produce functional code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones, and explicit security instructions don't significantly improve security.

Conclusion: SecureAgentBench establishes a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and highlights the need for further research to improve LLM-powered code agents' security capabilities for reliable software development.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming
software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and
repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a
critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain
insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities
were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture
either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore
introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to
rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each
task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in
large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source
vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii)
comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability
checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced
vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents
(SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents
struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent
supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions,
(ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce
vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding
explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure
coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish
SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step
toward more reliable software development with LLMs.

*Lukas Twist,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Systematic study shows LLMs are highly vulnerable to library hallucinations triggered by realistic user prompt variations, with one-character misspellings causing hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks and fake library names accepted in up to 99% of tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly generate code but frequently hallucinate non-existent libraries, which can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats like slopsquatting. Little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates.

Method: Evaluated six diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). Investigated realistic user language from developer forums and user errors including one/multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members.

Result: Systemic vulnerabilities found: one-character misspellings trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names accepted in up to 99% of tasks, time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent.

Conclusion: LLMs are fragile to natural prompt variation, highlighting urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they
continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library
hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break
builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting.
Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how
real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present
the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library
hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two
hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library
member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how
realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of
varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake
names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic
vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger
hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to
99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of
tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but
remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of
LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards
against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: CapPO is a reinforcement learning framework that addresses perception-induced errors in multimodal LLMs by enforcing perceptual consistency through caption-based regularization and KL-weighted advantage estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs suffer from perception-induced errors that propagate through reasoning chains, and current RL fine-tuning methods fail to address the misalignment between visual grounding and reasoning.

Method: Caption-Regularized Policy Optimization (CapPO) integrates caption-based consistency regularization (minimizing divergence between image and caption responses) and KL-weighted advantage estimation (adaptively scaling reinforcement signals).

Result: Achieves +6.0% accuracy on math tasks and +2.4% on general reasoning tasks over base Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, with significant reduction in perception-related mistakes.

Conclusion: CapPO provides a simple yet effective framework for improving multimodal reasoning by explicitly enforcing perceptual consistency during policy optimization.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at tasks that integrate visual
perception with symbolic reasoning, their performance is often undermined by a
critical vulnerability: perception-induced errors that propagate through the
reasoning chain. Current reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, while
enhancing reasoning abilities, largely fail to address the underlying
misalignment between visual grounding and the subsequent reasoning process. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Caption-Regularized Policy
Optimization (CapPO)}, a novel RL framework that explicitly enforces perceptual
consistency during policy optimization. CapPO integrates two key mechanisms:
(1) a caption-based consistency regularization, which minimizes the divergence
between responses conditioned on raw images and those conditioned on captions,
thereby anchoring reasoning to semantically faithful visual content; and (2) a
KL-weighted advantage estimation scheme, which adaptively scales reinforcement
signals to strengthen perceptually consistent trajectories while suppressing
spurious correlations. Extensive experiments on five math-focused and five
general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CapPO achieves competitive
performance, yielding gains of +6.0% accuracy on math-related tasks and +2.4%
on general reasoning tasks over the base Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Moreover,
ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while
error analysis reveals that CapPO significantly reduces perception-related
mistakes compared with baselines. Overall, CapPO provides a simple yet
effective framework for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: MDAR is a new benchmark for evaluating audio reasoning models on complex, multi-scene scenarios with 3,000 question-answer pairs across five reasoning categories and three question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio benchmarks focus on static or single-scene settings and don't capture real-world scenarios with multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interacting.

Method: Introduces MDAR benchmark with 3,000 curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and three question types (single-choice, multiple-choice, open-ended).

Result: Benchmarked 26 state-of-the-art audio language models. Qwen2.5-Omni achieved 76.67% on single-choice questions while GPT-4o Audio got 68.47%, but GPT-4o Audio performed better on more challenging multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. No model achieved 80% performance across all question types.

Conclusion: MDAR poses unique challenges for current audio reasoning models and serves as a valuable benchmark for advancing audio reasoning research, highlighting limitations in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, paralinguistic cues,
environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact
effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static
or single-scene settings and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple
speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To
address these challenges, we introduce MDAR, a benchmark for evaluating models
on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. MDAR
comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio
clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three
question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on MDAR
and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. On
single-choice questions, Qwen2.5-Omni (open-source) achieves 76.67% accuracy,
whereas GPT-4o Audio (closed-source) reaches 68.47%; however, GPT-4o Audio
substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice
and open-ended tasks. Across all three question types, no model achieves 80%
performance. These findings underscore the unique challenges posed by MDAR and
its value as a benchmark for advancing audio reasoning research.Code and

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating LLMs on loop invariant synthesis, showing current LLM-based verifiers don't yet outperform traditional solver UAutomizer, but fine-tuning and sampling can improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically discovering strong loop invariants for program verification remains challenging, and there's a need to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in this area with principled assessment methods.

Method: Uses a verifier-based decision procedure with formal soundness guarantee to evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs and existing LLM-based verifiers against traditional solver UAutomizer, assessing both correctness and verification speedup.

Result: LLM-based verifiers don't yet offer significant advantage over UAutomizer. Model capability varies greatly, with sharp differences in speedups across models. Supervised fine-tuning on 3589 instances improved Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2% speedup cases, and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improved Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.

Conclusion: Current LLMs still face challenges in invariant synthesis, but fine-tuning and sampling techniques show promise for improvement. The benchmark remains an open challenge for current LLMs.

Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering
strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled
framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a
verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and
assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in
verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based
verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers
represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage
over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp
differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open
challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and
Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances
raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%,
and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.

Motivation: Verification proofs contain complete program behavior information but are discarded after checking correctness, representing wasted optimization potential.

Method: Construct All-Path Reachability Proofs through symbolic execution and compile their graph structure to consolidate semantic rewrites into single rules while preserving correctness by construction. Implemented as language-agnostic extension to K framework.

Result: Evaluation shows performance improvements: opcode-level optimizations achieve consistent speedups, while whole-program compilation achieves orders of magnitude greater performance gains.

Conclusion: The compiling by proving paradigm successfully leverages verification proofs for optimization, demonstrating significant performance improvements across different compilation scopes.

### [276] [LLMs for Bayesian Optimization in Scientific Domains: Are We There Yet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21403)
*Rushil Gupta,Jason Hartford,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs fail at in-context experimental design, showing no sensitivity to feedback, while classical methods outperform them. A hybrid LLMNN method combining LLM priors with nearest-neighbor sampling achieves competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate claims that LLMs can perform in-context experimental design and compare their performance against classical methods in scientific domains like genetic perturbation and molecular property discovery.

Method: Evaluated open- and closed-source LLMs on experimental design tasks, tested sensitivity to feedback by permuting labels, compared against linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization, and proposed LLMNN hybrid method combining LLM priors with nearest-neighbor sampling.

Result: LLMs showed no sensitivity to experimental feedback (permuted labels had no impact), classical methods consistently outperformed LLM agents, and LLMNN achieved competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring significant in-context adaptation.

Conclusion: Current LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design effectively, highlighting the need for hybrid frameworks that separate prior-based reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

### [277] [Are Hallucinations Bad Estimations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21473)
*Hude Liu,Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu,Jennifer Yuntong Zhang,Zhao Song,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hallucinations in generative models are defined as failures to link estimates to plausible causes, and even optimal estimators can hallucinate due to structural misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why hallucinations occur in generative models even with optimal estimators, and to reframe hallucinations as structural issues rather than simple estimation errors.

Method: Formalized hallucinations as failures to link estimates to plausible causes, derived a high probability lower bound on hallucination rates for generic data distributions, and conducted experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image tasks.

Result: Showed that even loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate, with theoretical bounds confirming this phenomenon across different domains.

Conclusion: Hallucinations are structural misalignments between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, representing estimation errors from miscalibration rather than simple model failures.

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

### [278] [Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Tracing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21514)
*Joshua Mitton,Prarthana Bhattacharyya,Ralph Abboud,Simon Woodhead*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes adding uncertainty estimation capabilities to Knowledge Tracing models to detect when models make incorrect predictions, particularly when students choose distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most KT models focus on accuracy improvements but fail to detect their own incorrect predictions, especially when students select distractors, leading to undetected student errors.

Method: The approach captures predictive uncertainty in KT models and demonstrates that higher uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.

Result: The research shows that uncertainty in KT models is informative and provides a useful signal for detecting model errors.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation would be pedagogically useful in educational platforms, particularly in resource-limited settings where understanding student ability is crucial.

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

### [280] [Bridging Kolmogorov Complexity and Deep Learning: Asymptotically Optimal Description Length Objectives for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22445)
*Peter Shaw,James Cohan,Jacob Eisenstein,Kristina Toutanova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces asymptotically optimal description length objectives for Transformers based on Kolmogorov complexity theory, proving they achieve optimal compression up to additive constants and can be made tractable through variational methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying the Minimum Description Length principle to neural networks like Transformers is challenging due to the lack of principled measures for model complexity, motivating the need for theoretically grounded objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees.

Method: The authors establish asymptotically optimal description length objectives grounded in Kolmogorov complexity theory, prove their existence for Transformers using computational universality results, and construct a tractable variational objective using adaptive Gaussian mixture priors.

Result: Empirical analysis shows the variational objective selects low-complexity solutions with strong generalization on algorithmic tasks, though standard optimizers struggle to find such solutions from random initialization.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretical foundation for identifying description length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees, outlining a path toward training neural networks that achieve better compression and generalization.

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

### [281] [IIET: Efficient Numerical Transformer via Implicit Iterative Euler Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22463)
*Xinyu Liu,Bei Li,Jiahao Liu,Junhao Ruan,Kechen Jiao,Hongyin Tang,Jingang Wang,Xiao Tong,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IIET Transformer uses iterative implicit Euler method to simplify high-order numerical methods, achieving better performance than PCformer and vanilla Transformers while enabling efficient model compression through IIAD distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-order numerical methods improve Transformer performance but create performance-efficiency trade-offs, and conventional efficiency techniques like distillation can harm performance of models like PCformer.

Method: Proposed IIET (Iterative Implicit Euler Transformer) simplifies high-order methods using iterative implicit Euler approach, and introduced IIAD (Iteration Influence-Aware Distillation) with flexible threshold to balance performance-efficiency trade-off.

Result: IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65% over vanilla Transformers and 0.8% over PCformer. E-IIET variant cuts inference overhead by 55% while retaining 99.4% original task accuracy. Most efficient variant achieves >1.6% performance gain over vanilla Transformer with comparable speed.

Conclusion: IIET provides superior performance over existing high-order methods while enabling effective model compression through IIAD, successfully addressing the performance-efficiency trade-off in ODE-based Transformers.

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

### [282] [EPO: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM Agents Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22576)
*Xu Wujiang,Wentian Zhao,Zhenting Wang,Li Yu-Jhe,Jin Can,Jin Mingyu,Mei Kai,Wan Kun,Metaxas Dimitris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPO is a new framework that addresses exploration-exploitation cascade failure in multi-turn sparse-reward environments for LLM agents, achieving up to 152% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards (30+ turns per task) presents fundamental RL challenges, particularly exploration-exploitation cascade failure where agents prematurely converge to flawed strategies and then collapse due to chaotic exploration.

Method: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO) with three mechanisms: (1) entropy regularization for exploration, (2) entropy smoothing regularizer to bound policy entropy within historical averages, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting to balance exploration and exploitation across training.

Result: EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld, while guaranteeing monotonically decreasing entropy variance and maintaining convergence.

Conclusion: Multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with EPO providing an effective solution that has broad implications for LLM agent training.

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

### [283] [Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22601)
*Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Zhengbao He,Gang Li,Haojia Lin,Zongyi Li,Zihan Xu,Yuchen Shi,Siqi Cai,Renting Rui,Shaofei Cai,Yuzheng Cai,Xuan Zhang,Sheng Ye,Ke Li,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEAR is a curriculum-based self-imitation learning method that balances exploration-exploitation in RL training for agentic LLMs through staged entropy control and intrinsic rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs face exploration-exploitation trade-offs and training instability due to multi-turn distribution shifting, with mechanical entropy maximization causing either entropy collapse or divergence.

Method: Extends vanilla self-imitation learning with curriculum-based entropy control, using intrinsic rewards for skill-level exploration and SIL for action-level exploration. Includes advantage recalibration and regularization techniques like token clipping.

Result: The method enables progressive skill accumulation with upward entropy trend initially, then accelerates solution iteration through self-imitation without unbounded entropy growth.

Conclusion: SPEAR provides stable RL training for agentic LLMs by balancing exploration and exploitation through curriculum-based entropy management and self-imitation learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

### [284] [IA2: Alignment with ICL Activations Improves Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22621)
*Aayush Mishra,Daniel Khashabi,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICL Activation Alignment (IA2) is a self-distillation technique that replicates ICL's activation patterns in SFT models, improving accuracy and calibration across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage ICL's better generalizability and calibrated responses in data-scarce settings to improve SFT model qualities, since ICL and SFT show distinct activation patterns indicating different adaptation mechanisms.

Method: Introduces ICL Activation Alignment (IA2) - a self-distillation technique that replicates ICL's activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning, performed as a priming step before SFT.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy and calibration of model outputs across 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families.

Conclusion: IA2 not only provides practical improvements to SFT but also offers insights into the inner mechanics of model adaptation through activation pattern analysis.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

### [285] [VISION: Prompting Ocean Vertical Velocity Reconstruction from Incomplete Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21477)
*Yuan Gao,Hao Wu,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Xian Wu,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VISION is a novel ocean dynamics reconstruction method that uses Dynamic Prompting to handle missing data by generating visual prompts from available observations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KD48 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics from incomplete surface observations and the lack of standardized benchmarks in Earth science.

Method: Dynamic Prompting paradigm that generates visual prompts from available observations, combined with State-conditioned Prompting module and geometry- and scale-aware operators in a universal backbone.

Result: VISION substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models and shows strong generalization under extreme data missing scenarios on the KD48 benchmark.

Conclusion: The work provides both a high-quality benchmark (KD48) and a robust model (VISION) that establish solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty.

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

### [286] [SlimDiff: Training-Free, Activation-Guided Hands-free Slimming of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21498)
*Arani Roy,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlimDiff is a gradient-free structural compression framework for diffusion models that reduces attention and feedforward dimensions through spectral approximation guided by activation covariances, achieving 35% acceleration and ~100M parameter reduction without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive due to their large parameter sizes and iterative nature. Existing efficiency techniques require fine-tuning or retraining, creating bottlenecks in deployment.

Method: Reframes DM compression as spectral approximation using activation covariances across denoising timesteps to define low-rank subspaces. Uses module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups (query-key, value-output, feedforward) with adaptive sparsity allocation.

Result: Achieves up to 35% acceleration and ~100M parameter reduction while maintaining generation quality comparable to uncompressed models. Requires only about 500 calibration samples (70× fewer than prior methods).

Conclusion: SlimDiff provides the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression for diffusion models that is entirely training-free, offering both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

*Weiqiao Han,Chenlin Meng,Christopher D. Manning,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistillKac is a fast image generator using damped wave equation and Kac representation for finite-speed probability transport, enabling high-quality sampling with few function evaluations while maintaining numerical stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diffusion models' issues with stiff reverse time velocities and unbounded propagation speed by enforcing finite speed transport and bounded kinetic energy through Kac dynamics.

Method: Uses damped wave equation and stochastic Kac representation for finite-speed probability transport, introduces classifier-free guidance in velocity space, and proposes endpoint-only distillation that trains a student to match a teacher over long intervals.

Result: DistillKac delivers high-quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines finite speed transport with efficient sampling, providing a stable alternative to diffusion models with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

*Hongyang He,Xinyuan Song,Yangfan He,Zeyu Zhang,Yanshu Li,Haochen You,Lifan Sun,Wenqiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRiCo is a triadic game-theoretic co-training framework for semi-supervised learning that uses a teacher, two students, and an adversarial generator in a unified training paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing SSL frameworks including static view interactions, unreliable pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling by creating a more structured and principled approach.

Method: Formulates SSL as a Stackelberg game with three roles: two student classifiers on complementary representations, a meta-learned teacher for adaptive pseudo-label selection and loss balancing, and a non-parametric generator for adversarial perturbations. Uses mutual information for pseudo-label selection instead of confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet show TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes while being architecture-agnostic and compatible with frozen vision backbones.

Conclusion: TRiCo provides a principled and generalizable solution for semi-supervised learning that outperforms existing methods through its novel triadic game-theoretic framework.

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

### [289] [Closing the Oracle Gap: Increment Vector Transformation for Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21898)
*Zihuan Qiu,Yi Xu,Fanman Meng,Runtong Zhang,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a plug-and-play framework for Class Incremental Learning that maintains linear connectivity to previous task optima to reduce catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIL methods have significant performance gaps compared to oracle models trained with full historical data. Inspired by Linear Mode Connectivity observations that oracle solutions maintain low-loss linear connections to previous task optima.

Method: IVT periodically teleports model parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to previous task optimum, using diagonal Fisher Information Matrices for efficient approximation. Works for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based scenarios.

Result: On CIFAR-100: +5.12% last accuracy improvement for PASS baseline, 2.54% forgetting reduction. On FGVCAircraft with CLIP-pre-trained SLCA: +14.93% average accuracy, +21.95% last accuracy. Consistent improvements across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: IVT effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in CIL by maintaining linear connectivity to previous task optima, demonstrating significant performance gains across various benchmarks and baselines.

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods use teacher models trained with ground-truth labels, ignoring the diverse representations within the same class that could help student models generalize better.

Method: Incorporates intra-class contrastive loss with margin during teacher training to enrich intra-class information in soft labels, addressing training instability and convergence issues.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows intra-class contrastive loss enriches intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed intra-class contrastive loss with margin successfully enhances intra-class information in teacher models, improving knowledge distillation performance.

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

### [291] [Adaptive Dual-Mode Distillation with Incentive Schemes for Scalable, Heterogeneous Federated Learning on Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22507)
*Zahid Iqbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes three federated learning methods (DL-SH, DL-MH, I-DL-MH) to address statistical heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, and client incentive challenges in decentralized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces key challenges: not all clients can train same models due to business needs and computational constraints, statistical heterogeneity (non-IID data) reduces global model performance, and lack of cost-effective incentives discourages client participation.

Method: Three proposed approaches: DL-SH for efficient privacy-preserving learning with statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH for managing fully heterogeneous models while handling statistical disparities; I-DL-MH as an incentive-based extension of DL-MH to promote client engagement.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements: DL-SH enhances global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH achieves 225% improvement under non-IID conditions, while also reducing communication costs compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively address key FL challenges, significantly improving accuracy and reducing communication costs while handling both statistical and model heterogeneity, with incentive mechanisms successfully promoting client participation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

*Guillem Capellera,Luis Ferraz,Antonio Rubio,Alexandre Alahi,Antonio Agudo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JointDiff is a diffusion framework that simultaneously generates continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events, bridging the gap between modeling continuous and discrete processes in complex systems like sports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation where generative models treat continuous data and discrete events as separate processes, creating a gap in modeling complex interactive systems where they occur synchronously.

Method: Introduces JointDiff diffusion framework with CrossGuid conditioning operation for multi-agent domains, enabling joint generation of continuous trajectories and discrete events. Supports non-controllable generation and two controllable scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance and text-guidance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. Validated on enhanced soccer and football datasets with textual descriptions.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of continuous and discrete processes is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems, as demonstrated by JointDiff's superior performance.

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

### [293] [Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562)
*Lute Lillo,Nick Cheney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation functions play a crucial role in mitigating plasticity loss in continual learning. The paper introduces Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky nonlinearities that sustain model adaptability under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In continual learning, models progressively lose plasticity (ability to adapt) beyond catastrophic forgetting, and the role of activation functions in this failure mode is underexplored.

Method: Introduces two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) based on analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior. Evaluates in supervised class-incremental benchmarks and reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments.

Result: Activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. The proposed nonlinearities effectively sustain plasticity without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Conclusion: Thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning, making it a practical solution for maintaining model adaptability under changing conditions.

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

*Lu Sun,Shihan Fu,Bingsheng Yao,Yuxuan Lu,Wenbo Li,Hansu Gu,Jiri Gesi,Jing Huang,Chen Luo,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well LLM-based digital twins can represent human users in multi-turn interactions with agentic AI systems like Amazon Rufus, showing they produce similar design feedback despite some behavioral differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human evaluation struggles to keep pace with rapidly evolving agentic AI systems, and it's unclear if LLM agents can effectively simulate specific customers in multi-turn interactions.

Method: Recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon Rufus, collected their personas and interaction traces, then created digital twins to repeat the same shopping tasks for comparison.

Result: Digital twins explored more diverse choices but their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar UX design feedback, demonstrating close mirroring of human multi-turn interactions.

Conclusion: LLM agents can effectively mirror human interactions with agentic AI systems, showing potential for scalable evaluation of rapidly evolving AI assistants.

Abstract: Agentic AI is emerging, capable of executing tasks through natural language,
such as Copilot for coding or Amazon Rufus for shopping. Evaluating these
systems is challenging, as their rapid evolution outpaces traditional human
evaluation. Researchers have proposed LLM Agents to simulate participants as
digital twins, but it remains unclear to what extent a digital twin can
represent a specific customer in multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI
system. In this paper, we recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon
Rufus, collected their personas, interaction traces, and UX feedback, and then
created digital twins to repeat the task. Pairwise comparison of human and
digital-twin traces shows that while agents often explored more diverse
choices, their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar design
feedback. This study is the first to quantify how closely LLM agents can mirror
human multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system, highlighting their
potential for scalable evaluation.

Motivation: There is growing interest in using LLM agents for social simulations to inform policy, but real-world adoption remains limited. The paper aims to address how LLM agent simulations can be made genuinely useful for policy.

Method: A year-long iterative design engagement with a university emergency preparedness team, developing a system of 13,000 LLM agents that simulate crowd movement and communication during large-scale gatherings under various emergency scenarios.

Result: The simulations directly informed actual policy implementation, shaping volunteer training, evacuation protocols, and infrastructure planning. The process identified three key design implications for making LLM agent simulations useful for policy.

*Yunhao Yuan,Jiaxun Zhang,Talayeh Aledavood,Renwen Zhang,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI companion chatbots show mixed psychosocial effects: increased emotional expression and social focus but also heightened loneliness and suicidal ideation risks, requiring design for healthy boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the psychosocial impacts of AI-powered companion chatbots (AICCs) like Replika, as their popularity grows but effects remain unclear.

Method: Two-part study: 1) Large-scale quasi-experimental analysis of longitudinal Reddit data using stratified propensity score matching and Difference-in-Differences regression; 2) 15 semi-structured interviews analyzed thematically using Knapp's relationship development model.

Result: Mixed effects: increased affective/grief expression, readability, interpersonal focus, but also increased language about loneliness and suicidal ideation. Interviews revealed relationship trajectories (initiation, escalation, bonding) with emotional validation benefits but risks of over-reliance and withdrawal.

Conclusion: Design implications for AI companions should scaffold healthy boundaries, support mindful engagement, enable disclosure without dependency, and surface relationship stages to maximize benefits while mitigating risks.

Abstract: AI-powered companion chatbots (AICCs) such as Replika are increasingly
popular, offering empathetic interactions, yet their psychosocial impacts
remain unclear. We examined how engaging with AICCs shaped wellbeing and how
users perceived these experiences. First, we conducted a large-scale
quasi-experimental study of longitudinal Reddit data, applying stratified
propensity score matching and Difference-in-Differences regression. Findings
revealed mixed effects -- greater affective and grief expression, readability,
and interpersonal focus, alongside increases in language about loneliness and
suicidal ideation. Second, we complemented these results with 15
semi-structured interviews, which we thematically analyzed and contextualized
using Knapp's relationship development model. We identified trajectories of
initiation, escalation, and bonding, wherein AICCs provided emotional
validation and social rehearsal but also carried risks of over-reliance and
withdrawal. Triangulating across methods, we offer design implications for AI
companions that scaffold healthy boundaries, support mindful engagement,
support disclosure without dependency, and surface relationship stages --
maximizing psychosocial benefits while mitigating risks.

Motivation: Workplace negotiations are undermined by psychological barriers, and while AI offers personalized coaching, its effectiveness for negotiation preparedness remains unclear.

Method: Built Trucey AI coach based on Brett's negotiation model, conducted between-subjects experiment (N=267) comparing Trucey, ChatGPT, and traditional Handbook, followed by in-depth interviews (N=15).

Result: Trucey showed strongest reductions in fear, but Handbook outperformed both AIs in usability and psychological empowerment. Handbook's comprehensive content built confidence better than AI's fragmented guidance.

Conclusion: Findings challenge AI superiority assumptions and motivate hybrid designs integrating structured theory-driven content with targeted rehearsal, clear boundaries, and adaptive scaffolds.

Abstract: Workplace negotiations are undermined by psychological barriers, which can
even derail well-prepared tactics. AI offers personalized and always --
available negotiation coaching, yet its effectiveness for negotiation
preparedness remains unclear. We built Trucey, a prototype AI coach grounded in
Brett's negotiation model. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=267),
comparing Trucey, ChatGPT, and a traditional negotiation Handbook, followed by
in-depth interviews (N=15). While Trucey showed the strongest reductions in
fear relative to both comparison conditions, the Handbook outperformed both AIs
in usability and psychological empowerment. Interviews revealed that the
Handbook's comprehensive, reviewable content was crucial for participants'
confidence and preparedness. In contrast, although participants valued AI's
rehearsal capability, its guidance often felt verbose and fragmented --
delivered in bits and pieces that required additional effort -- leaving them
uncertain or overwhelmed. These findings challenge assumptions of AI
superiority and motivate hybrid designs that integrate structured,
theory-driven content with targeted rehearsal, clear boundaries, and adaptive
scaffolds to address psychological barriers and support negotiation
preparedness.

### [298] [Patch-Based Diffusion for Data-Efficient, Radiologist-Preferred MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21531)
*Rohan Sanda,Asad Aali,Andrew Johnston,Eduardo Reis,Jonathan Singh,Gordon Wetzstein,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Patch-based diffusion models (PaDIS-MRI) outperform whole-image diffusion models for 7x undersampled MRI reconstruction, achieving better image quality and diagnostic accuracy even with small training datasets of only 25 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI requires long acquisition times, increasing costs and motion artifacts. Diffusion models can help reduce acquisition time but typically need large datasets, which are expensive to collect in clinical settings.

Method: Extended Patch-based Diffusion Inverse Solver (PaDIS) to complex-valued, multi-coil MRI reconstruction and compared against FastMRI-EDM baseline for 7x undersampled reconstruction on FastMRI brain dataset.

Result: PaDIS-MRI trained on only 25 images outperformed FastMRI-EDM on image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE), uncertainty, cross-contrast generalization, and robustness. In blinded study, radiologists preferred PaDIS-MRI in 91.7% of cases over baselines.

Conclusion: Patch-based diffusion priors enable high-fidelity MRI reconstruction in data-scarce clinical settings while maintaining diagnostic confidence.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires long acquisition times, raising
costs, reducing accessibility, and making scans more susceptible to motion
artifacts. Diffusion probabilistic models that learn data-driven priors can
potentially assist in reducing acquisition time. However, they typically
require large training datasets that can be prohibitively expensive to collect.
Patch-based diffusion models have shown promise in learning effective
data-driven priors over small real-valued datasets, but have not yet
demonstrated clinical value in MRI. We extend the Patch-based Diffusion Inverse
Solver (PaDIS) to complex-valued, multi-coil MRI reconstruction, and compare it
against a state-of-the-art whole-image diffusion baseline (FastMRI-EDM) for 7x
undersampled MRI reconstruction on the FastMRI brain dataset. We show that
PaDIS-MRI models trained on small datasets of as few as 25 k-space images
outperform FastMRI-EDM on image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE),
pixel-level uncertainty, cross-contrast generalization, and robustness to
severe k-space undersampling. In a blinded study with three radiologists,
PaDIS-MRI reconstructions were chosen as diagnostically superior in 91.7% of
cases, compared to baselines (i) FastMRI-EDM and (ii) classical convex
reconstruction with wavelet sparsity. These findings highlight the potential of
patch-based diffusion priors for high-fidelity MRI reconstruction in
data-scarce clinical settings where diagnostic confidence matters.

*Emily Honey,Anders Helbo,Jens Petersen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper compares cGAN (Pix2Pix) and cDDPM (Palette) architectures for MRI-to-CT translation, finding that cDDPM with multi-slice conditioning performs best and proposing a 2D slice-based approach to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT scans are essential for medical treatment but sometimes unavailable, creating need for synthetic CT generation from MRI. There's value in establishing which strategies work best for MRI-to-CT translation.

Method: Compared cGAN (Pix2Pix) and cDDPM (Palette) architectures for MRI-to-CT translation. Used 2D slice-based approach on transverse plane to reduce computational costs. Investigated single vs multi-slice conditioning. Evaluated with comprehensive metrics including novel SIMOS metric for slice continuity.

Result: cDDPM architecture outperformed cGAN. Multi-channel conditional input (multiple MRI slices) improved performance. The 2D slice-based strategy was viable for reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: MRI-to-CT generative models benefit most from using cDDPM architecture with multi-slice conditioning, and the 2D slice-based approach is an effective computational optimization.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is essential for treatment and diagnostics; In case
CT are missing or otherwise difficult to obtain, methods for generating
synthetic CT (sCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are
sought after. Therefore, it is valuable to establish a reference for what
strategies are most effective for MRI-to-CT translation. In this paper, we
compare the performance of two frequently used architectures for MRI-to-CT
translation: a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (cDDPM). We chose
well-established implementations to represent each architecture: Pix2Pix for
cGAN, and Palette for cDDPM. We separate the classical 3D translation problem
into a sequence of 2D translations on the transverse plane, to investigate the
viability of a strategy that reduces the computational cost. We also
investigate the impact of conditioning the generative process on a single MRI
image/slice and on multiple MRI slices. The performance is assessed using a
thorough evaluation protocol, including a novel slice-wise metric Similarity Of
Slices (SIMOS), which measures the continuity between transverse slices when
compiling the sCTs into 3D format. Our comparative analysis revealed that
MRI-to-CT generative models benefit from multi-channel conditional input and
using cDDPM as an architecture.

*Matt Y. Cheung,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: COMPASS is a conformal prediction framework that generates efficient uncertainty intervals for downstream metrics in medical image segmentation by perturbing intermediate features rather than treating the segmentation-to-metric pipeline as a black box.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models depends on the accuracy of derived metrics like organ size rather than pixel-level segmentation accuracy, making uncertainty quantification for these metrics crucial for decision-making.

Method: COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces that are maximally sensitive to the target metric, leveraging the inductive biases of deep neural networks.

Result: COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than traditional conformal prediction baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures, and maintains target coverage under covariate shifts using learned importance weights.

Conclusion: COMPASS provides a practical framework for metric-based uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation by efficiently leveraging model representations rather than treating the complex segmentation-to-metric pipeline as a black box.

Abstract: In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models is often based
on the accuracy of derived downstream metrics such as organ size, rather than
by the pixel-level accuracy of the segmentation masks themselves. Thus,
uncertainty quantification for such metrics is crucial for decision-making.
Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular framework to derive such principled
uncertainty guarantees, but applying CP naively to the final scalar metric is
inefficient because it treats the complex, non-linear segmentation-to-metric
pipeline as a black box. We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that
generates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by
leveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks.
COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by
perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally
sensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal
coverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we
demonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than
traditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area
estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures. Furthermore, we show that
leveraging learned internal features to estimate importance weights allows
COMPASS to also recover target coverage under covariate shifts. COMPASS paves
the way for practical, metric-based uncertainty quantification for medical
image segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A patch-based 3D nnUNet adaptation for MR-to-CT and CBCT-to-CT image translation using SynthRAD2025 dataset, featuring residual UNet and AFP loss for improved anatomical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a stable solution for cross-modality medical image synthesis that enhances reconstruction of clinically relevant structures through anatomical feature prioritization.

Method: Adapted nnUNet with standard and residual UNet configurations, using AFP loss with features from segmentation network, 3D patches per anatomical region, and training with L1+AFP objective.

Result: Residual networks with AFP yielded sharper reconstructions and improved anatomical fidelity, especially for bone structures and lesions, while L1-only networks achieved better intensity-based metrics.

Conclusion: Combining nnUNet pipeline with residual learning and anatomically guided feature losses provides an effective methodology for cross-modality medical image synthesis.

Abstract: We present a patch-based 3D nnUNet adaptation for MR to CT and CBCT to CT
image translation using the multicenter SynthRAD2025 dataset, covering head and
neck (HN), thorax (TH), and abdomen (AB) regions. Our approach leverages two
main network configurations: a standard UNet and a residual UNet, both adapted
from nnUNet for image synthesis. The Anatomical Feature-Prioritized (AFP) loss
was introduced, which compares multilayer features extracted from a compact
segmentation network trained on TotalSegmentator labels, enhancing
reconstruction of clinically relevant structures. Input volumes were normalized
per-case using zscore normalization for MRIs, and clipping plus dataset level
zscore normalization for CBCT and CT. Training used 3D patches tailored to each
anatomical region without additional data augmentation. Models were trained for
1000 and 1500 epochs, with AFP fine-tuning performed for 500 epochs using a
combined L1+AFP objective. During inference, overlapping patches were
aggregated via mean averaging with step size of 0.3, and postprocessing
included reverse zscore normalization. Both network configurations were applied
across all regions, allowing consistent model design while capturing local
adaptations through residual learning and AFP loss. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluation revealed that residual networks combined with AFP
yielded sharper reconstructions and improved anatomical fidelity, particularly
for bone structures in MR to CT and lesions in CBCT to CT, while L1only
networks achieved slightly better intensity-based metrics. This methodology
provides a stable solution for cross modality medical image synthesis,
demonstrating the effectiveness of combining the automatic nnUNet pipeline with
residual learning and anatomically guided feature losses.

### [302] [Towards Efficient Online Exploration for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22633)
*Gen Li,Yuling Yan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new exploration scheme for online RLHF that improves data efficiency by directing preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences relevant to policy improvement, achieving polynomial regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimism-based exploration algorithms in online RLHF tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, leading to linear regret over exponentially long horizons.

Method: Proposes a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement, under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF.

Result: Establishes regret bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$ where $\beta>0$ balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift - the first online RLHF algorithm with polynomial regret scaling in all model parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed exploration scheme provides a more data-efficient approach to online RLHF by focusing preference queries on the most informative uncertainties for policy improvement.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward
model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred
responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration
principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new
preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a
data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration
algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to
gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in
reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can
incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this
insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries
toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy
improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret
bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter
that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our
knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling
polynomially in all model parameters.

### [304] [SBFA: Single Sneaky Bit Flip Attack to Break Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21843)
*Jingkai Guo,Chaitali Chakrabarti,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SBFA (Sneaky Bit-Flip Attack) is a novel attack method that can collapse LLM performance with just one single bit flip while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution, revealing severe security vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) have limitations - they focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, and in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause extreme values that are not stealthy and lead to numerical runtime errors. There's a need for more flexible and stealthy attacks.

Method: SBFA uses iterative searching and ranking through a defined parameter sensitivity metric called ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity and perturbation range constrained by benign layer-wise weight distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to greatly reduce searching complexity.

Result: Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 benchmarks in both BF16 and INT8 data formats. The attack takes only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs.

Conclusion: Flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a severe security concern of SOTA LLM models, demonstrating that despite modularity and redundancy, LLMs remain highly vulnerable to targeted bit-flip attacks.

Abstract: Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing
security concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks
(BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can
severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips
can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs
and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and
redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs'
catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically
focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack
flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause
perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making
it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor
values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky
Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip
while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It
is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined
parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity
and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight
distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to
greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching
taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma
models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to
below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats.
Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a
severe security concern of SOTA LLM models.

### [305] [You Can't Steal Nothing: Mitigating Prompt Leakages in LLMs via System Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21884)
*Bochuan Cao,Changjiang Li,Yuanpu Cao,Yameng Ge,Ting Wang,Jinghui Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SysVec addresses system prompt leakage in LLMs by encoding prompts as internal vectors instead of raw text, providing security while maintaining functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are vulnerable to prompt leakage attacks where system prompts can be extracted, even from state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Method: Proposes SysVec - encoding system prompts as internal representation vectors rather than raw text in the context, eliminating the risk of text-based leakage.

Result: SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves LLM functional integrity, improves instruction-following abilities, and alleviates forgetting in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: Encoding system prompts as internal vectors provides a fundamental security solution against prompt leakage while enhancing model capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across various
applications, leveraging customized system prompts for diverse tasks. Facing
potential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented
strategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their
context when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable
to new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first
introduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks.
Our attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based
application, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our
findings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the
problems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose
SysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation
vectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of
unauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities.
Remarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the
model's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves
the LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in
long-context scenarios.

### [306] [Guidance Watermarking for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22126)
*Enoal Gesny,Eva Giboulot,Teddy Furon,Vivien Chappelier*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel watermarking method for diffusion models that guides the diffusion process using gradients from off-the-shelf watermark decoders, converting post-hoc schemes into in-generation embedding without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust watermarking method for diffusion models that works with existing watermark detectors and doesn't require model retraining or fine-tuning.

Method: Uses gradient guidance from any off-the-shelf watermark decoder during the diffusion process, incorporating image augmentations to enhance robustness against various attacks.

Result: Successfully converts post-hoc watermarking schemes into in-generation embedding, preserves image quality and diversity, and works with different diffusion models and detectors.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective way to embed watermarks during generation that complements existing techniques and maintains generation quality while being robust to attacks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel watermarking method for diffusion models. It is
based on guiding the diffusion process using the gradient computed from any
off-the-shelf watermark decoder. The gradient computation encompasses different
image augmentations, increasing robustness to attacks against which the decoder
was not originally robust, without retraining or fine-tuning. Our method
effectively convert any \textit{post-hoc} watermarking scheme into an
in-generation embedding along the diffusion process. We show that this approach
is complementary to watermarking techniques modifying the variational
autoencoder at the end of the diffusion process. We validate the methods on
different diffusion models and detectors. The watermarking guidance does not
significantly alter the generated image for a given seed and prompt, preserving
both the diversity and quality of generation.

*Manjari Rudra,Daniel Magleby,Sujoy Sikdar*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: A pipeline was developed to extract question-answer pairs from congressional hearing transcripts, creating a dataset that reveals systematic differences in questioning strategies between political parties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political questions serve strategic purposes beyond information gathering, but these strategic aspects are understudied due to lack of large-scale datasets. Congressional hearings provide a rich site for studying political questioning due to their structured format and guaranteed participation from both parties.

Method: Developed a pipeline to extract question-answer pairs from unstructured hearing transcripts and constructed a novel dataset of committee hearings from the 108th-117th Congress.

Result: Analysis revealed systematic differences in questioning strategies across parties, showing that party affiliation of questioners can be predicted from their questions alone.

Conclusion: The dataset and methods advance the study of congressional politics and provide a general framework for analyzing question-answering across interview-like settings.

Abstract: Questions in political interviews and hearings serve strategic purposes
beyond information gathering including advancing partisan narratives and
shaping public perceptions. However, these strategic aspects remain
understudied due to the lack of large-scale datasets for studying such
discourse. Congressional hearings provide an especially rich and tractable site
for studying political questioning: Interactions are structured by formal
rules, witnesses are obliged to respond, and members with different political
affiliations are guaranteed opportunities to ask questions, enabling
comparisons of behaviors across the political spectrum.
  We develop a pipeline to extract question-answer pairs from unstructured
hearing transcripts and construct a novel dataset of committee hearings from
the 108th--117th Congress. Our analysis reveals systematic differences in
questioning strategies across parties, by showing the party affiliation of

### [308] [See, Point, Fly: A Learning-Free VLM Framework for Universal Unmanned Aerial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22653)
*Chih Yao Hu,Yang-Sen Lin,Yuna Lee,Chih-Hai Su,Jie-Ying Lee,Shr-Ruei Tsai,Chin-Yang Lin,Kuan-Wen Chen,Tsung-Wei Ke,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPF is a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation framework that treats action prediction as 2D spatial grounding rather than text generation, enabling UAVs to navigate to any goal with free-form instructions in any environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as text generation, and to enable more effective aerial navigation with free-form instructions in dynamic environments.

Method: Uses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative 2D waypoint annotations on input images, then transforms these into 3D displacement vectors with adaptive traveling distance adjustment for closed-loop UAV control.

Result: Sets new SOTA in DRL simulation benchmark with 63% absolute improvement over previous best method, and outperforms strong baselines by large margins in real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: SPF demonstrates remarkable generalization across different VLMs and provides an effective training-free framework for aerial vision-and-language navigation through spatial grounding approach.

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

*Yashom Dighe,Yash Turkar,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VISION is an autonomous inspection system that uses vision-language models and constrained viewpoint planning to inspect culverts, achieving 80% expert agreement after re-imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human inspection of culverts is challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and difficult access, requiring an automated solution.

Method: End-to-end system coupling web-scale vision-language models with constrained viewpoint planning, using prompts to solicit ROI proposals, stereo depth for scale recovery, and a planner for repositioning moves.

Result: Initial ROI proposals achieved 61.4% agreement with experts, and final assessments after re-imaging reached 80% expert agreement.

Conclusion: VISION successfully converts tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

### [310] [RoboView-Bias: Benchmarking Visual Bias in Embodied Agents for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22356)
*Enguang Liu,Siyuan Liang,Liming Lu,Xiyu Zeng,Xiaochun Cao,Aishan Liu,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboView-Bias is the first benchmark to systematically quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, revealing significant biases in embodied agents and proposing a mitigation strategy that reduces bias by 54.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on generalization and robustness but lack systematic quantification of visual bias, limiting understanding of how perception affects decision-making stability in embodied agents.

Method: Created 2,127 task instances using a structured variant-generation framework and perceptual-fairness validation protocol to measure biases from individual visual factors and their interactions.

Result: Three key findings: (i) all agents show significant visual biases with camera viewpoint being most critical; (ii) agents perform best on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited VLM preferences; (iii) visual biases show strong asymmetric coupling.

Conclusion: Systematic visual bias analysis is essential for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents, and the proposed semantic grounding layer effectively reduces visual bias.

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

*Farida Mohsen,Ali Safa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an RGB-only pipeline for human-robot interaction intent prediction with frame-level precision, addressing class imbalance through synthetic data generation and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on multimodal inputs (RGB-D) for human-robot interaction intent detection, which can be resource-intensive. The need for faster robot responses and improved service quality motivates an RGB-only solution with frame-level precision.

Method: Introduces MINT-RVAE for synthetic sequence generation to address class imbalance, along with new loss functions and training strategies. Uses only RGB input for frame-level intent prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with AUROC: 0.95, outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912). Enables precise frame onset prediction while using only RGB input.

Conclusion: The RGB-only approach successfully addresses class imbalance and achieves superior performance for human-robot interaction intent prediction, with the additional contribution of releasing a new frame-level labeled dataset for future research.

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WoW is a 14B-parameter world model trained on 2M robot interactions that develops physical intuition through active interaction, outperforming passive models like Sora in physical causality understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models rely on passive observation and struggle with physical causality, while humans learn physics through active interaction. The hypothesis is that authentic physical intuition requires extensive, causally rich real-world interactions.

Method: Train WoW on 2 million robot interaction trajectories, use SOPHIA (vision-language agents) to guide refinement of generated outputs, and employ co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model to translate plans into executable actions.

Result: WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance on WoWBench benchmark for physical consistency and causal reasoning, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence.

Conclusion: Large-scale real-world interaction is essential for developing physical intuition in AI, and WoW provides systematic evidence supporting this approach.

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DAWN is a unified diffusion-based framework for robot control that uses structured pixel motion representation to bridge high-level motion intent with low-level robot actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and demonstrating reliable real-world transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that bridges the gap between high-level motion planning and low-level robot control using diffusion processes, enabling interpretable motion abstractions and scalable robot learning.

Method: Models both high-level and low-level controllers as diffusion processes using structured pixel motion representation, creating a fully trainable end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on CALVIN benchmark, demonstrates strong multi-task performance on MetaWorld, and shows reliable real-world transfer with minimal finetuning despite domain gaps.

Conclusion: Combining diffusion modeling with motion-centric representations provides an effective baseline for scalable and robust robot learning, demonstrating practical viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control.

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured
pixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level
controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable,
end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN
achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,
demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its
effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between
simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable
real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical
viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our
results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with
motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust

*Guohang Yan,Yue Zhang,Pinlong Cai,Ding Wang,Song Mao,Hongwei Zhang,Yaoze Zhang,Hairong Zhang,Xinyu Cai,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HetaRAG is a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation framework that combines multiple retrieval modalities (vector search, knowledge graphs, full-text indexes, and relational databases) to overcome limitations of single-modality RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems use single storage backends with unavoidable trade-offs: vector search loses global context, knowledge graphs struggle with recall, full-text indexes are semantically blind, and relational databases lack semantic understanding. These heterogeneous retrieval paradigms are complementary.

Method: Proposes a principled fusion scheme to orchestrate cross-modal evidence from heterogeneous data stores, unifying vector indices, knowledge graphs, full-text engines, and structured databases into a single retrieval plane with dynamic routing and evidence fusion.

Result: Preliminary explorations and an initial RAG pipeline have been constructed, with partial code available on GitHub. The framework aims to maximize recall, precision, and contextual fidelity.

Conclusion: HetaRAG demonstrates that combining multiple retrieval modalities can synergistically mitigate the weaknesses of any single modality, providing a more robust and effective retrieval-augmented generation system.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a dominant paradigm for
mitigating knowledge hallucination and staleness in large language models
(LLMs) while preserving data security. By retrieving relevant evidence from
private, domain-specific corpora and injecting it into carefully engineered
prompts, RAG delivers trustworthy responses without the prohibitive cost of
fine-tuning. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are
text-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector
database. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable
trade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global
context; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with
recall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and
relational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no
semantic understanding. We argue that these heterogeneous retrieval paradigms
are complementary, and propose a principled fusion scheme to orchestrate them
synergistically, mitigating the weaknesses of any single modality. In this work
we introduce HetaRAG, a hybrid, deep-retrieval augmented generation framework
that orchestrates cross-modal evidence from heterogeneous data stores. We plan
to design a system that unifies vector indices, knowledge graphs, full-text
engines, and structured databases into a single retrieval plane, dynamically
routing and fusing evidence to maximize recall, precision, and contextual
fidelity. To achieve this design goal, we carried out preliminary explorations
and constructed an initial RAG pipeline; this technical report provides a brief
overview. The partial code is available at

TL;DR: ReGeS is a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework for conversational recommender systems that unifies generation-augmented retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation to improve recommendation accuracy without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational recommender systems either require domain-specific engineering (limiting flexibility) or rely solely on large language models (increasing hallucination risk). Naive RAG approaches are hindered by noisy dialogues and overlooked nuances among similar items.

Method: Proposes ReGeS framework with reciprocal synergy: generation-augmented retrieval to distill user intent from conversations, and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. Eliminates need for extra annotations and simplifies continuous updates.

Result: Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: Reciprocal synergy between retrieval and generation is effective for knowledge-intensive conversational recommender systems, reducing hallucinations and improving performance.

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for
conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user
preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific
engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models,
which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that
weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose
ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies
generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from
conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item
features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces
hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS
benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in
recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy
for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

### [316] [Can Synthetic Query Rewrites Capture User Intent Better than Humans in Retrieval-Augmented Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22325)
*JiaYing Zheng,HaiNan Zhang,Liang Pang,YongXin Tong,ZhiMing Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SynRewrite is a synthetic data-driven query rewriting model that generates high-quality rewrites more aligned with user intent, outperforming human rewrites in multi-turn RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators, but their rewrites often diverge from real-world RAG system needs due to limitations in expressive ability and understanding, creating a gap between user intent and system response.

Method: Construct training data by prompting GPT-4o with dialogue history, queries, documents, and answers to synthesize rewrites. Finetune Flan-T5 on this dataset, then enhance with generator feedback using DPO algorithm.

Result: Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show SynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and generation tasks.

Conclusion: Synthetic rewrites can serve as a scalable and effective alternative to human annotations for query rewriting in multi-turn RAG systems.

Abstract: Multi-turn RAG systems often face queries with colloquial omissions and
ambiguous references, posing significant challenges for effective retrieval and
generation. Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify
queries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of
understanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in
real-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system
response. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this
gap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared
to human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models
trained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators?
In this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting
model to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user
intent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history,
current queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality
rewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue
history and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the
rewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost
end-task performance. Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show that
SynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and
generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that synthetic rewrites can serve as
a scalable and effective alternative to human annotations.

*Jiahao Zhang,Wenzhe Yin,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence for cross-modal retrieval, addressing limitations of existing methods, and extends it to Generalized CS (GCS) divergence for multi-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal retrieval methods suffer from numerical instability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and inability to capture full distribution structure. They mainly focus on bi-modal tasks and rely on problematic alignment techniques.

Method: Proposes CS divergence as a hyperparameter-free measure for better training stability and performance. Extends to GCS divergence using Hölder's inequality for direct alignment of three or more modalities through bidirectional circular comparison.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness in both bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: CS/GCS divergence provides improved training stability and retrieval performance for cross-modal tasks, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous
data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on
distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence,
Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods
often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability,
sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full
structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the
Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves
both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel
Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by H\"older's inequality. This
extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified
mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme,
eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments
on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both
bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is
publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD.

Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding
framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract
regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three

articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation
models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper presents AUDDT, an open-source benchmarking toolkit for systematically evaluating audio deepfake detectors across 28 datasets to assess their generalization to real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing audio deepfake detection models are evaluated on narrow datasets, leaving their real-world generalization uncertain. There's a need for systematic benchmarking across diverse datasets.

Method: Developed AUDDT toolkit that automates evaluation of pretrained detectors across 28 audio deepfake datasets. Analyzed dataset composition, deepfake subgroups, and performed in-domain and out-of-domain detection tests using a widely adopted pretrained detector.

Result: Revealed notable performance differences across conditions and audio manipulation types. Showed significant gaps in existing datasets relative to practical deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: The AUDDT toolkit provides systematic evaluation capabilities for audio deepfake detectors, highlighting current limitations in dataset coverage and the need for better generalization to real-world conditions.

Abstract: With the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, such
as audio deepfakes, a large body of recent work has focused on developing
deepfake detection techniques. However, most models are evaluated on a narrow
set of datasets, leaving their generalization to real-world conditions
uncertain. In this paper, we systematically review 28 existing audio deepfake
datasets and present an open-source benchmarking toolkit called AUDDT
(https://github.com/MuSAELab/AUDDT). The goal of this toolkit is to automate
the evaluation of pretrained detectors across these 28 datasets, giving users
direct feedback on the advantages and shortcomings of their deepfake detectors.
We start by showcasing the usage of the developed toolkit, the composition of
our benchmark, and the breakdown of different deepfake subgroups. Next, using a
widely adopted pretrained deepfake detector, we present in- and out-of-domain
detection results, revealing notable differences across conditions and audio
manipulation types. Lastly, we also analyze the limitations of these existing
datasets and their gap relative to practical deployment scenarios.

### [320] [Speak Your Mind: The Speech Continuation Task as a Probe of Voice-Based Model Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22061)
*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Harm Lameris,Olivier Perrotin,Gustav Eje Henter,Éva Székely*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of bias in Speech Continuation (SC) tasks, focusing on gender and phonation type effects in speech foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech Continuation offers a more direct setting than dialogue for probing biases in speech foundation models since it's constrained to a single audio stream, allowing better investigation of representational biases.

Method: Evaluated three recent models (SpiritLM base/expressive, VAE-GSLM, SpeechGPT) across speaker similarity, voice quality preservation, and text-based bias metrics, specifically examining gender and phonation type (breathy, creaky, end-creak) effects.

Result: While speaker similarity and coherence remain challenging, textual evaluations revealed significant model and gender interactions. Once coherence is high enough (VAE-GSLM), gender effects emerge on text metrics like agency and sentence polarity. Continuations revert toward modal phonation more strongly for female prompts than male ones, revealing systematic voice-quality bias.

Conclusion: Speech Continuation serves as a controlled probe for socially relevant representational biases in speech foundation models and will become increasingly informative as continuation quality improves.

Abstract: Speech Continuation (SC) is the task of generating a coherent extension of a
spoken prompt while preserving both semantic context and speaker identity.
Because SC is constrained to a single audio stream, it offers a more direct
setting for probing biases in speech foundation models than dialogue does. In
this work we present the first systematic evaluation of bias in SC,
investigating how gender and phonation type (breathy, creaky, end-creak) affect
continuation behaviour. We evaluate three recent models: SpiritLM (base and
expressive), VAE-GSLM, and SpeechGPT across speaker similarity, voice quality
preservation, and text-based bias metrics. Results show that while both speaker
similarity and coherence remain a challenge, textual evaluations reveal
significant model and gender interactions: once coherence is sufficiently high
(for VAE-GSLM), gender effects emerge on text-metrics such as agency and
sentence polarity. In addition, continuations revert toward modal phonation
more strongly for female prompts than for male ones, revealing a systematic
voice-quality bias. These findings highlight SC as a controlled probe of
socially relevant representational biases in speech foundation models, and
suggest that it will become an increasingly informative diagnostic as
continuation quality improves.

TL;DR: ControlHair is a physics-informed video diffusion framework that combines physics simulation with conditional video diffusion to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models lack fine-grained control over hair dynamics, which is challenging due to complex strand dynamics, diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Encode physics parameters into per-frame geometry using simulator, 2) Extract per-frame control signals, 3) Feed control signals into video diffusion model to generate videos with desired hair dynamics.

Result: Outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering precisely controlled hair dynamics. Demonstrated use cases include dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic applications.

Conclusion: ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for controllable dynamics, decoupling physics reasoning from video generation while supporting diverse physics parameters.

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DeformSplat reconstructs object deformation from a single image using 3D Gaussian representations guided by novel Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching and Rigid Part Segmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require multi-view video for deformation recovery, limiting applicability in constrained scenarios. Single-image deformation reconstruction remains challenging.

Method: Proposes DeformSplat framework with two main contributions: Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching to bridge 3D-2D domain gap, and Rigid Part Segmentation (initialization + refinement) to identify rigid regions for geometric coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant outperformance over existing methods. Framework naturally extends to applications like frame interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Conclusion: DeformSplat enables consistent deformation reconstruction from single images, overcoming limitations of multi-view dependency while maintaining geometric coherence through rigid part identification.

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Aerial path planning framework for co-capturing urban geometry and high-fidelity textures using only 2D building contours and safe flying altitude, with novel texture quality metrics and multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene capture techniques focus on geometry but overlook texture quality, leading to visual artifacts in textured models. There's a need for co-capture of both structured geometry and high-fidelity textures under limited prior knowledge.

Method: Proposes aerial path planning with vertical dipping and horizontal planar views, multi-objective optimization for texture fidelity and geometric accuracy, and sequential path planning for texture consistency. Uses novel texture quality assessment metrics for building facades.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the approach effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture reconstruction, enabling realistic textured scene proxies at low operational cost.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the urban geometry and texture co-capture problem, producing high-quality textured urban models with minimal prior information and operational costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Claim Advisor is a web application using LLMs to accelerate product claim creation through semantic search, claim generation/optimization, and ranking via synthetic consumer simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Product claims drive consumer purchase behavior but are expensive and time-consuming to create manually.

Method: Uses in-context learning and fine-tuning of large language models for three functions: semantic search of existing claims, claim generation/optimization from product descriptions and consumer profiles, and ranking claims via synthetic consumer simulations.

Result: Applications in a consumer packaged goods company showed very promising results.

Conclusion: The capability is broadly useful across product categories and industries, encouraging generative AI research and application in different sectors.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

### [326] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to evaluate white box monitors for detecting harmful behaviors in LLMs, addressing performance inflation from data leakage during training/evaluation. It proposes three mitigation strategies and identifies two types of leakage that artificially boost monitor effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: White box monitors for detecting harmful behaviors in LLMs face challenges because the methods used to elicit target behaviors (prompting/fine-tuning) leak information into the training data, artificially inflating monitor performance rather than measuring genuine detection capability.

Method: Proposes three evaluation strategies: content filtering (removing deception-related text), score filtering (aggregating over task-relevant tokens), and prompt-distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Uses deception detection as a case study.

Result: Identifies two forms of leakage: elicitation leakage from explicit harmful prompts and reasoning leakage from models verbalizing deceptive actions. Content filtering decreased probe AUROC by 30%, score filtering reduced AUROC by 15%, and fine-tuned model organisms reduced monitor performance by up to 40% even when retrained.

Conclusion: Current monitor evaluations are significantly inflated by data leakage. The proposed mitigation strategies reveal substantial performance drops, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks that measure genuine behavior detection rather than superficial artifacts.

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UltraHorizon is a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents in long-horizon, partially observable tasks requiring sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use, revealing significant performance gaps between LLM-agents and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks, while real-world challenges like software development and scientific discovery require long-horizon capabilities that current evaluations don't capture.

Method: Created UltraHorizon benchmark with exploration tasks across three environments where agents must iteratively uncover hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool interactions, with trajectories averaging 35k-200k+ tokens and 60-400+ tool calls.

Result: LLM-agents consistently underperform in long-horizon settings while human participants achieve higher scores. Simple scaling fails, and analysis reveals eight error types attributed to in-context locking and functional capability gaps.

Conclusion: There's a persistent gap in agents' long-horizon abilities that current approaches don't address, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks and agent capabilities for complex real-world tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

TL;DR: RISK is a framework for building GUI agents for e-commerce risk management that handles multi-step web interactions, featuring a dataset, benchmark, and reinforcement fine-tuning method that outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scraping methods and GUI agents cannot handle the complex, multi-step, stateful interactions required for e-commerce risk management, particularly with dynamic web content.

Method: RISK framework with three components: RISK-Data (dataset of interaction trajectories), RISK-Bench (evaluation benchmark), and RISK-R1 (reinforcement fine-tuning framework with format, stepwise, process, and task-level rewards).

Result: RISK-R1 achieves 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and 8.8% improvement in offline multi-step tasks, with 70.5% task success rate in online evaluation.

Conclusion: RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific solution for automating complex web interactions in e-commerce risk management, advancing the state of the art.

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model merging enables tunable LLMs by combining general-purpose and specialized reasoning models, offering fine-grained control over reasoning depth vs computational cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing demand for LLMs with adjustable reasoning capabilities that balance accuracy and efficiency, but current methods lack fine-grained control over this trade-off.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study evaluating various model merging techniques across reasoning benchmarks, systematically varying merging strengths to create accuracy-efficiency curves.

Result: Model merging effectively calibrates reasoning accuracy vs token efficiency trade-off, even with divergent parent models. Found instances of Pareto Improvement where merged models outperform parents in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Model merging provides practical method for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles, offering comprehensive guidelines for meeting diverse application demands.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

*Ziqi Wang,Boye Niu,Zhongli Li,Linghui Meng,Jing Liu,Zhi Zheng,Tong Xu,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A2R is an asymmetric two-stage reasoning framework that uses an explorer model to generate multiple solutions in parallel, followed by a synthesizer model to integrate them for refined reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between a model's latent potential and its actual performance in single attempts, which persists even as reasoning capabilities advance.

Method: Two-stage framework: explorer generates multiple solution paths in parallel, synthesizer integrates references for refined reasoning. Uses asymmetric scaling with smaller explorer and larger synthesizer.

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill achieved 75% performance improvement over self-consistency baseline. A2R-Efficient with Qwen3-4B explorer and Qwen3-8B synthesizer surpassed monolithic Qwen3-32B performance at 30% lower cost.

Conclusion: A2R is both a performance-boosting framework and an efficient practical solution that scales computation orthogonally to existing sequential methods.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRIME is a multi-agent reasoning framework that integrates fast System 1 thinking and deliberate System 2 thinking to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human dual-process cognition theory from Thinking, Fast and Slow, to improve LLM reasoning efficiency and accuracy by mimicking human cognitive processes.

Method: Uses Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) for rapid answers, then triggers structured System 2 pipeline with specialized agents for planning, hypothesis generation, retrieval, information integration, and decision-making when uncertainty is detected.

Result: Experimental results show PRIME enables open-source LLaMA 3 models to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PRIME establishes a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning through multi-agent cognitive modeling.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

*Yixuan Han,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by adding computation during inference. Current methods focus on output sampling but ignore model architecture. The paper proposes Dynamic Experts Search (DES), which leverages MoE architecture by controlling expert activation counts to generate diverse reasoning paths without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS approaches rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In MoE LLMs, varying activated expert counts produces complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing an underexplored source of diversity.

Method: DES consists of two components: (1) Dynamic MoE - enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance - preserves consistent expert counts within reasoning paths while varying them across runs, balancing stability and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (math, code, knowledge) show DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost.

Conclusion: DES represents a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, demonstrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

*Simone Lionetti,Fabian Gröger,Philippe Gottfrois,Alvaro Gonzalez-Jimenez,Ludovic Amruthalingam,Alexander A. Navarini,Marc Pouly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Machine learning evaluations should account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that operate on distributions, rather than relying on aggregated labels like majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical dataset labels are uncertain due to annotator disagreement and varying confidence levels, but typical aggregation methods obscure this variability and impact model rankings.

Method: Propose probabilistic metrics that directly operate on label distributions, which can be applied regardless of annotation generation process (counting, confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models).

Result: Accounting for confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings in medical imaging benchmarks. The metrics are computationally lightweight with linear-time implementations.

Conclusion: The community should release raw annotations and adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation to better reflect clinical data reality in performance estimates.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

TL;DR: ViF addresses multi-agent visual hallucination snowballing in VLM-powered systems by identifying and preserving key visual tokens, using a plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that improves performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems using visual language models suffer from hallucination snowballing, where visual errors in one agent get amplified through textual communication, reducing visual attention allocation.

Method: Proposes ViF - a lightweight paradigm that relays inter-agent messages with visual flow using selected visual relay tokens and applies attention reallocation to preserve visual evidence.

Result: Markedly reduces hallucination snowballing and consistently improves performance across eight benchmarks using four MAS structures and ten base models.

Conclusion: ViF effectively mitigates visual hallucination snowballing in multi-agent systems by preserving critical visual information through attention reallocation and visual token selection.

Abstract: Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables
challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual
hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent
and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to
relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention
analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination
snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us
to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle
layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper
agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we
propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays
inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay
tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The
experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination
snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks
based on four common MAS structures and ten base models. The source code will
be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/ViF.git.
